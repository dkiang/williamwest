5094,"And what I loved most, she had so much soul"
5095,"She said, ""Excuse me, little homie, I know you don't know me"
5096,"But my name is Windy and I like to blow trees."""
5097,"And from that point, I never blow her off"
5098,"Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her off"
5099,"They like to act tough, she like to toe 'em off"
5100,And make 'em straighten up their hat 'cause she know they soft
5101,"And when I grew up, she showed me how to go downtown"
5102,"In the nighttime, her face lit up, so astoundin'"
5103,I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
5104,She never messed with entertainers 'cause they always leave
5105,"She said, ""It felt like they walked and drove on me."""
5106,"Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me"
5107,I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
5108,"She said, ""'Ye, keep makin' that, keep makin' that platinum and gold for me!"""
5109,I'm comin' home again
5110,Do you think about me now and then?

5117,But if you really cared for her
5118,Then you wouldn't've never hit the airport to follow your dreams
5119,Sometimes I still talk to her
5120,"But when I talk to her, it always seems like she talkin' 'bout me"
5121,"She said, ""You left your kids, and they just like you"
5122,They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
5123,"But they just not you,"" and I just got through"
5124,Talkin' 'bout what niggas tryin' to do: just not new
5125,Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
5126,I guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone
5127,I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home
5128,And guess when I heard that? When I was back home
5129,"Every interview, I'm representin' you, makin' you proud"

5151,My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
5152,Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother
5153,"Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend"
5154,"No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin"
5155,"It's the Hard Knock Life Tour, sellout"
5156,"Picture us in the mall, coppin' Iceberg and yell out ""Jigga"""
5157,"Yeah, that's what we'll yell out, yell out"
5158,You know the name do I gotta spell out or tell 'bout
5159,"J-A-Y, and 'Ye so shy"
5160,Now he won't even step to his idol to say hi
5161,Standing there like a mime and let the chance pass by
5162,"Back of my mind, ""He could change your life"
5163,"With all these beats I did, at least let him hear it"
5164,"At least you can brag to ya friends back at the gig"""
5165,But he got me out my momma crib
5166,Then he help me get my momma a crib
5167,Big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
5168,Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother
5169,"Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend"
5170,"No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin, begin"
5171,Let the story begin
5172,If you feel the way I feel why don't you wave your hands?
5173,"Fresh off the plane, I'm off to Baseline"
5174,"Nothing handed out, I'm 'bout to take mine"
5175,'round the same time of that Blueprint 1
5176,And these beats in my pocket was that blueprint for him
5177,I'd play my little songs in that old back room
5178,"He'd bob his head and say ""Damn! Oh, that's you?"""
5179,"But by The Black Album, I was blacking out"
5180,Partyin' S.O.B.'s and we had packed a crowd
5181,Big brother got his show up at Madison Square
5182,"And I'm like ""Yeah, yeah, we gon' be there"" but"
5183,Not only did I not get a chance to spit it
5184,Carline told me I could buy two tickets
5185,I guess big brother was thinkin' a little different
5186,"And kept little brother at bay, at a distance"
5187,But everything that I felt was more bogus
5188,"Only made me more focused, only wrote more potent"
5189,Only thing I wanna know is why I get looked over
5190,I guess I'll understand when I get more older
5191,Big brother saw me at the bottom of the totem
5192,Now I'm on the top and everybody on the scrotum
5193,My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
5194,Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother
5195,"Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend"
5196,"No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin, begin"
5197,Let the story begin
5198,If you feel the way I feel why don't you wave your hands?
5199,Have you ever walked in the shadow of a giant?
5200,"Not only a client, the Presidito, hola, Hovito"
5201,The game gettin' foul so here's a free throw
5202,I was always on the other side of the peephole
5203,"Then I dropped ""Jesus Walks"" now I'm on the steeple"
5204,"And we know, ""New Jack City""—got to keep my brother"
5205,But to be number one I'ma beat my brother
5206,"On that ""Diamonds"" remix I swore I spazzed"
5207,Then my big brother came through and kicked my ass
5208,"Sibling rivalry, only I could see"
5209,It was the pride in me that was drivin' me
5210,"At the Grammys I said, ""I inspired me"""
5211,But my big brother who I always tried to be
5212,When I kicked a flow it was like pick-and-roll
5213,"Cause even if he gave me the rock, it's give-and-go"
5214,I guess Beanie's style was more of a slam dunk
5215,And my shit was more like a finger roll
5216,But I had them singles though
5217,"And them hoes at the show gonna mingle, yo, heh, y'all know"
5218,I told Jay I did a song with Coldplay
5219,Next thing I know he got a song with Coldplay
5220,"Back in my mind I'm like, ""Damn, no way"""
5221,"Translate, español: ""No way, José"""
5222,Then I went and told Jay Brown
5223,Shoulda known that was gonna come back around
5224,"Shoulda talked to you like a man, shoulda told you first"
5225,But I told somebody else and that's what made shit worse
5226,My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
5227,So here's a few words from ya kid brother
5228,If you admire somebody you should go on 'head tell 'em
5229,People never get the flowers while they can still smell 'em
5230,"A idol in my eyes, god of the game"
5231,"Heart of the City, Roc-a-Fella chain"
5232,"Never be the same, never be another"
5233,"Number one, Young Hov, also my big brother"
5234,My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
5235,Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother
5236,"Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend"
5237,"No I.D., my mentor, and that's where the story ends"
5238,Toomp killed this shit
5239,"I'm not sure anymore, more"
5240,"Who is knocking at my door, door"
5241,All the faces that I know
5242,Ja make them so sunny and true
5243,"I don't wanna say goodbye, to you"

5245,"My people, no goodbyes to you"
5246,I'm just gon' say good night
5247,Uh
5248,Good night
5249,Right now I can see it so vivid
5250,"Like it was just yesterday, like I could relive it"
5251,Me and my grandparents on a field trip
5252,And I'm the little kid tryna touch the exhibits
5253,But it'll fade before I get to get a hold of that
5254,"Man, I wish I could stop time like a photograph"
5255,Every joke that they told I'd know to laugh
5256,"Man (man), I wouldn't let a moment pass"
5257,What do it mean when you dream that you fallin'?
5258,What do it mean when you dream that you ballin'?
5259,What do it mean when you never dream at all then
5260,And you don't really know 'cause you can't recall them?
5261,It's sorta fly you get a chance to say hi to
5262,People you never got a chance to say bye to
5263,Maybe you could pull em up outta your dreams
5264,"Into real life (real life), if you try to"
5265,"So close (so close), but so far (but so far)"
5266,"And so far (and so far), no cigar (no cigar)"

5309,"We've been generally warned, that's what the surgeon says"
5310,"God, talk to me now, this is an emergency"
5311,And she claims she only with me for the currency
5312,"You cut me deep, bitch, cut me like surgery"
5313,And I was too proud to admit that it was hurting me
5314,"I'd never do that to you, at least purposely"
5315,"We breaking up again, we making up again"
5316,"But we don't love no more, I guess we fucking then"
5317,Have you ever felt you ever want to kill her?
5318,And you mix them emotions with tequila
5319,And you mix that with a little bad advice
5320,"On one of them bad nights, y'all have a bad fight"
5321,"And you talk about her family, her aunts and shit"
5322,"And she say, ""Motherfucker, your momma's a bitch"""

5336,And my niggas said I shouldn't let it worry me
5337,I need to focus on the girls we getting currently
5338,But I been thinking and it got me back to sinking
5339,"And this relationship, it even got me back to drinking"
5340,"Now this Hennessy, uh, it's gonna be the death of me"
5341,And I always thought that you having my child was our destiny

5410,But we'll a find a way
5411,And nothing last forever but be honest babe
5412,It hurts but it may be the only way
5413,They say people in your life are seasons
5414,And anything that happen is for a reason
5415,And niggas gun clapping and keep to squeezing
5416,And Gran keep praying and keep believing
5417,"In Jesus, and one day that you see him"
5418,'Til then walk in his footsteps and try to be him
5419,The devil is alive I feel him breathin
5420,"Claiming money is the key, so keep on dreamin"
5421,And put them lottery tickets just to tease us
5422,My Aunt Pam can't put them cigarettes down
5423,So now my little cousin smokin' them cigarettes now
5424,His job try to claim that he too niggerish now

5448,I felt like Bad Boy's street team: I couldn't work the locks
5449,"Now let's go, take 'em back to the plan"
5450,Me and my momma hopped in that U-Haul van
5451,"Any pessimists, I ain't talk to them"
5452,Plus I ain't have no phone in my apart-a-ment
5453,Let's take 'em back to the club
5454,Least about an hour I stand on line

5461,I gotta testify
5462,Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
5463,"'Fore the day I die, I'ma touch the sky"
5464,Gotta testify

5613,He nicknamed me K-Rock so they would leave me alone
5614,Bulls jacket with his hat broke way off
5615,And walked around the mall with his radio face off
5616,Plus he had the spinner from his Daytons in his hand
5617,"Keys in his hand, reason again to let you know he's the man"
5618,"Back when we rocked Ellesses, he had dreams of Caprices"
5619,"Drove by the teachers, even more by polices"

7059,We are all here for a reason on a particular path
7060,You don't need a curriculum to know that you're a part of the math
7061,Cats think I'm delirious but I'm so damn serious
7062,That's why I expose my soul to the globe; the world
7063,I'm trying to make it better for these little boys and girls
7064,I'm not just another individual
7065,My spirit is a part of this that's why I get spiritual
7066,But I get my hymns from Him
7067,"So it's not me, it's He that's lyrical"
7068,"I'm not a miracle, I'm a heaven-sent instrument"

7080,And if you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life
7081,"In my grip, I would never ever let you down"
7082,And when these words are found
7083,Let it be known that God's penmanship has been signed
7084,With a language called love
7085,That's why my breath is felt by the deaf
7086,And while my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind
7087,I too dream in color and in rhyme
7088,So I guess I'm one of a kind in a full house
7089,"'Cause whenever I open my heart, my soul or my mouth"
7090,A touch of God reigns out
7091,Take 'em to church
7092,"When it comes to being true, at least true to me"

8007,(Mr. Rockefeller)
8008,So get your ass up off the wall
8009,"So this A&R over at Roc-A-Fella, named Hip Hop Picked the ""Truth"" beat for Beanie. And I was in the session with him. I had my demo with me. You know, like I always do. I play the songs, he's like ""Who that spittin'?"" I'm like ""It's me."" He's like ""Oh, well okay."""
8010,"Uhh, he started talkin' to me on the phone, going back and forth"
8011,"Just askin' me to send him beats, and I'm thinking he's trying to get into managing producers, cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin' with"
8012,So won't you raise your glass won't you
8013,"And um, he was friends with my mentor, No ID. And No ID told him, ""Look, man, you wanna mess with Kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he rap"""
8014,"No ID: ""Yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he rap"""
8015,"I was all, I dunno if he was gassin' me or not but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer"
8016,"I'm like oh shit. I was messin' with, uh, D-Dot also. People were like this, started talking about the ghost production but that's how I got in the game. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be here. So you know, after they picked that ""Truth"" beat I was figuring I was gonna do some more work but shit just wasn't poppin' off like that. I was stayin' in Chicago, I had my own apartment, I be doin' like, just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy, get a Pelle Pelle off lay-away, get some Jordans or something or get a TechnoMarine, that's what we wore back then"
8017,"I made this one beat where I sped up this Harold Melvin sample I played it for Hip over the phone, he's like, ""Oh, yo that shit is crazy Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin', called The Dynasty. And at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin' right to me So I went and um, I was listening to Dre Chronic 2001 at that time. And really I just, like bit the drums off ""Xxplosive"" and put it like with a sped-up sample, and now it's kind of like my whole style, when it started, when he rapped on ""This Can't Be Life."""
8018,"And that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on The Dynasty album. I could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound You know, I got to come in and track the beat and at the time I was still with my other management. I really wanted to roll with Hip Hop cause I, I just needed some fresh air, you know what I'm sayin' cause I been there for a while. I appreciated what they did for me but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he gotta make a change. Try to move up to the next level. And that day I came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet JAY-Z and he said, ""Oh you a real soulful dude."""
8019,"And he, uh, played the song cause he already spit his verse by the time I got to the studio. You know how he do it, one take. And he said"
8020,"""Tell me what you think of this."" And I heard it, and I was thinking like, man, I really wanted more like of the simple type JAY-Z. I ain't want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the... in my personal opinion. So he asked me, ""What you think of it?"""
8021,"And I was like, ""Man that shit tight,"" you know what I'm sayin', man what I'ma tell him? I was on the train, man, you know. So after that, I went back home. And man I'm, I'm just in Chicago, I'm trying to do my thing. You know, I got groups. I got acts I'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin' really like poppin' off the way it should have been. One of my homies that was one of my artists, he got signed. But it was supposed to really go through my production company, but he ended up going straight with the company. So, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad news that dude was tryin' to leave my company. And I got evicted at the same time. So I went down and tracked the beats from him, I took that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about ten days before I had to actually get out so I ain't have to deal with the landlord cause he's a jerk. Me and my mother drove to..."
8022,"...Newark, New Jersey. I hadn't even seen my apartment. I remember I pulled up..."
8023,"...I unpacked all my shit. You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a bed, I put the bed together myself. I loaded up all my equipment, and the first beat I made was, uh, ""Heart of the City."" And Beans was still working on his album at that time, so I came up there to Baseline, it was Beans' birthday, matter of fact, and I played like seven beats. And, you know I guess he was in the zone, he already had the beats that he wanted, I had did ""Nothing Like It"" already at that time but then Jay walked in. I remember he had a Gucci bucket hat on. I remember it like, like it was yesterday. And Hip-hop said, ""Yo play that one beat for him."" And I played ""Heart of the City."" And really I made ""Heart of the City,"" I really wanted to give that beat to DMX"
8024,"And I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I remember that Gucci bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like 'OOOOOOOOOOH.' Two days later I'm in Baseline and I seen Dame. Dame didn't know who I was and I was like, ""Yo what's up I'm Kanye."""
8025,"""You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay? Yo, this nigga got classics to your beats"""
8026,"You know I ain't talkin' shit. I'm like ""oh shit."" And all this time I'm starstruck, man. I'm still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggas on the show, The Streets is Watching, I'm lookin', these were superstars in my eyes. And they still are, you know. So, Jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day, and in two days... I gotta bring up one thing, you know, come back to the story, the day I did the 'Can't be Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S, he had some Louis Vuitton sneakers on, he think he fly. And Hip Hop was there, I think Ty-Ty, John Meneilly, a bunch of people. I didn't know all these people at the time they was in the room, and I said, ""yo Jay I could rap."" And I spit this rap that said, uh ""I'm killin' y'all niggas on that lyrical shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips."" And I saw his eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the rest, the rap was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response. He said, ""Man that was tight."""
8027,"That was it. You know, I ain't get no deal then, hehe. Okay, fast forward. So, Blueprint, ""H to the Izzo,"" my first hit single. And I just took that proudly, built relationships with people. My relationship with Kweli I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper. Because, you know, of course, later he allowed me to go on tour with him. Man, I appre-- I love him for that. And at this time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I had relationships with all these A&R's, and they wanted beats from me, so they'd call me up, I'd play them some beats. ""Gimme a beat that sound like JAY-Z."" You know, they dick riders. Whatever. So I'll play them these post-Blueprint beats or whatever and then I'll play my shit. I'll be like, ""yo but I rap too."" Hey, I guess they was lookin' at me crazy cause you know, cause I ain't have a jersey on or whatever. Everybody out there listen here: I played them 'Jesus Walks' and they didn't sign me. You know what happened, it was some A&R's that fucked with me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the company that'll say, ""Naw."" Like, Dave Lighty fucked with me, my nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels. Jessica Rivera, man..."
8028,I'm not gonna say nothin' to mess my promotion up
8029,"Let's just say I didn't get my deal. The nigga that was behind me, I mean, he wasn't even a nigga, you know? The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol Records. He wanted to sign me really bad"
8030,"Dame was like, ""Yo you got a deal with Capitol? Okay man, just make sure it's not wack."""
8031,"Then one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to play some songs, cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and Dame was in the room. So I played... actually it's a song that you'll never hear, but maybe I might use it. So, it's called 'Wow.'"
8032,"""I go to Jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow"
8033,I got 11 plaques on my walls right now
8034,"You got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow."""
8035,"Like the chorus went. Don't bite that chorus, I might still use it. So I play that song for him and he's like ""oh shit"""
8036,"""I ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot."""
8037,"Like they still weren't looking at me like a rapper. And I'm sure Dame figured, 'Like man. If he do a whole album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and save the album, you know. So uh Dame took me into the office, and he's like ""yo man, B, B, you don't want a brick, you don't want a brick"""
8038,"""You gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on."" I told Hip-hop and Hip-hop was all, ""oh, word?"" Actually, even with that, I was still about to take the deal with Capitol cause it was already on the table and cause of my relationship with 3H. That, you know, cause I told him I was gonna do it, and I'm a man of my word, I was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do. Then, you know, I'm not gonna name no names, but people told me, ""oh he's just a producer-rapper,"" and told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol, and right-- the day I'm talking about, I planned out everything I was gonna do. Man, I had picked out clothes, I already started booking studio sessions, I started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes, man I was ready to go. And they had Mel call me, they said, ""yo... Capitol pulled on the deal"""
8039,"And, you know I told them that Roc-A-Fella was interested and I don't know if they thought that was just something I was saying to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever. I went up... I called G, I said, ""man, you think we could still get that deal with Roc-A-Fella?"""
8040,"So won't you raise your glass, won't you..."
