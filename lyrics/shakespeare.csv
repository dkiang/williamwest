1,"From fairest creatures we desire increase,"
2,"That thereby beauty’s rose might never die,"
3,"But as the riper should by time decease,"
4,His tender heir might bear his memory:
5,"But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,"
6,"Feed’st thy light’s flame with self-substantial fuel,"
7,"Making a famine where abundance lies,"
8,"Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:"
9,"Thou that art now the world’s fresh ornament,"
10,"And only herald to the gaudy spring,"
11,"Within thine own bud buriest thy content,"
12,"And, tender churl, mak’st waste in niggarding:"
13,"Pity the world, or else this glutton be,"
14,"To eat the world’s due, by the grave and thee."
15,"When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,"
16,"And dig deep trenches in thy beauty’s field,"
17,"Thy youth’s proud livery so gazed on now,"
18,Will be a tattered weed of small worth held:
19,"Then being asked, where all thy beauty lies,"
20,Where all the treasure of thy lusty days;
21,"To say, within thine own deep sunken eyes,"
22,"Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise."
23,"How much more praise deserv’d thy beauty’s use,"
24,If thou couldst answer ‘This fair child of mine
25,"Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse,’"
26,Proving his beauty by succession thine.
27,"This were to be new made when thou art old,"
28,And see thy blood warm when thou feel’st it cold.
29,"Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest,"
30,"Now is the time that face should form another,"
31,"Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,"
32,"Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother."
33,For where is she so fair whose uneared womb
34,Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?
35,Or who is he so fond will be the tomb
36,Of his self-love to stop posterity?
37,Thou art thy mother’s glass and she in thee
38,"Calls back the lovely April of her prime,"
39,"So thou through windows of thine age shalt see,"
40,Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.
41,"But if thou live remembered not to be,"
42,Die single and thine image dies with thee.
43,"Unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend,"
44,Upon thyself thy beauty’s legacy?
45,"Nature’s bequest gives nothing but doth lend,"
46,And being frank she lends to those are free:
47,"Then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse,"
48,The bounteous largess given thee to give?
49,Profitless usurer why dost thou use
50,So great a sum of sums yet canst not live?
51,"For having traffic with thyself alone,"
52,"Thou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive,"
53,"Then how when nature calls thee to be gone,"
54,What acceptable audit canst thou leave?
55,"Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee,"
56,Which used lives th’ executor to be.
57,Those hours that with gentle work did frame
58,The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell
59,"Will play the tyrants to the very same,"
60,And that unfair which fairly doth excel:
61,For never-resting time leads summer on
62,"To hideous winter and confounds him there,"
63,"Sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone,"
64,Beauty o’er-snowed and bareness every where:
65,Then were not summer’s distillation left
66,"A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,"
67,"Beauty’s effect with beauty were bereft,"
68,Nor it nor no remembrance what it was.
69,"But flowers distilled though they with winter meet,"
70,"Leese but their show, their substance still lives sweet."
71,"Then let not winter’s ragged hand deface,"
72,In thee thy summer ere thou be distilled:
73,"Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place,"
74,With beauty’s treasure ere it be self-killed:
75,"That use is not forbidden usury,"
76,Which happies those that pay the willing loan;
77,"That’s for thyself to breed another thee,"
78,"Or ten times happier be it ten for one,"
79,"Ten times thyself were happier than thou art,"
80,If ten of thine ten times refigured thee:
81,"Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart,"
82,Leaving thee living in posterity?
83,"Be not self-willed for thou art much too fair,"
84,To be death’s conquest and make worms thine heir.
85,Lo in the orient when the gracious light
86,"Lifts up his burning head, each under eye"
87,"Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,"
88,"Serving with looks his sacred majesty,"
89,"And having climbed the steep-up heavenly hill,"
90,"Resembling strong youth in his middle age,"
91,"Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,"
92,Attending on his golden pilgrimage:
93,"But when from highmost pitch with weary car,"
94,"Like feeble age he reeleth from the day,"
95,The eyes (fore duteous) now converted are
96,From his low tract and look another way:
97,"So thou, thyself out-going in thy noon:"
98,Unlooked on diest unless thou get a son.
99,How know’st thou this?
100,"Not long before your Highness sped to France,"
101,"The Duke being at the Rose, within the parish"
102,"Saint Laurence Poultney, did of me demand"
103,What was the speech among the Londoners
104,"Concerning the French journey. I replied,"
105,"Men fear the French would prove perfidious,"
106,To the King’s danger. Presently the Duke
107,"Said ’twas the fear indeed, and that he doubted"
108,’Twould prove the verity of certain words
109,"Spoke by a holy monk, “that oft,” says he,"
110,"“Hath sent to me, wishing me to permit"
111,"John de la Car, my chaplain, a choice hour"
112,To hear from him a matter of some moment;
113,Whom after under the confession’s seal
114,He solemnly had sworn that what he spoke
115,My chaplain to no creature living but
116,"To me should utter, with demure confidence"
117,"This pausingly ensued: ‘Neither the King nor’s heirs,"
118,Tell you the Duke—shall prosper. Bid him strive
119,To gain the love o’ th’ commonalty. The Duke
120,"If I know you well,"
121,"You were the Duke’s surveyor, and lost your office"
122,On the complaint o’ th’ tenants. Take good heed
123,You charge not in your spleen a noble person
124,"And spoil your nobler soul. I say, take heed—"
125,"Yes, heartily beseech you."
126,"On my soul, I’ll speak but truth."
127,"I told my lord the Duke, by th’ devil’s illusions"
128,"The monk might be deceived, and that ’twas dangerous"
129,For him to ruminate on this so far until
130,"It forged him some design, which, being believed,"
131,"It was much like to do. He answered, “Tush,"
132,"It can do me no damage,” adding further"
133,"That had the King in his last sickness failed,"
134,The Cardinal’s and Sir Thomas Lovell’s heads
135,Should have gone off.
136,"Ha! What, so rank? Ah ha!"
137,There’s mischief in this man. Canst thou say further?
138,"I can, my liege."
139,After your Highness had reproved the Duke
140,About Sir William Bulmer—
141,"Of such a time, being my sworn servant,"
142,The Duke retained him his. But on. What hence?
143,"“If,” quoth he, “I for this had been committed,”"
144,"As to the Tower, I thought, “I would have played"
145,The part my father meant to act upon
146,"Th’ usurper Richard who, being at Salisbury,"
147,"Made suit to come in ’s presence; which if granted,"
148,"As he made semblance of his duty, would"
149,Have put his knife into him.”
150,"Now, madam, may his Highness live in freedom,"
151,And this man out of prison?
152,There’s something more would out of thee. What sayst?
153,"After “the Duke his father,” with “the knife,”"
154,"He stretched him, and with one hand on his dagger,"
155,"Another spread on ’s breast, mounting his eyes,"
156,"He did discharge a horrible oath, whose tenour"
157,"Was, were he evil used, he would outgo"
158,His father by as much as a performance
159,Does an irresolute purpose.
160,To sheathe his knife in us. He is attached.
161,Call him to present trial. If he may
162,"Find mercy in the law, ’tis his; if none,"
163,"Let him not seek ’t of us. By day and night,"
164,He’s traitor to th’ height!
165,SCENE III. An ante-chamber in the palace.
166,Enter Lord Chamberlain  and Lord Sandys.
167,Is’t possible the spells of France should juggle
168,Men into such strange mysteries?
169,Though they be never so ridiculous—
170,"Nay, let ’em be unmanly—yet are followed."
171,"As far as I see, all the good our English"
172,Have got by the late voyage is but merely
173,"A fit or two o’ th’ face; but they are shrewd ones,"
174,"For when they hold ’em, you would swear directly"
175,Their very noses had been counsellors
176,"To Pepin or Clotharius, they keep state so."
177,"They have all new legs, and lame ones. One would take it,"
178,"That never saw ’em pace before, the spavin"
179,Or springhalt reigned among ’em.
180,"Their clothes are after such a pagan cut to’t,"
181,"That, sure, they’ve worn out Christendom."
182,Enter Sir Thomas Lovell.
183,"What news, Sir Thomas Lovell?"
184,I hear of none but the new proclamation
185,That’s clapped upon the court gate.
186,The reformation of our travelled gallants
187,"That fill the court with quarrels, talk, and tailors."
188,I’m glad ’tis there. Now I would pray our monsieurs
189,To think an English courtier may be wise
190,And never see the Louvre.
191,"For so run the conditions, leave those remnants"
192,"Of fool and feather that they got in France,"
193,With all their honourable points of ignorance
194,"Pertaining thereunto, as fights and fireworks,"
195,Abusing better men than they can be
196,"Out of a foreign wisdom, renouncing clean"
197,"The faith they have in tennis and tall stockings,"
198,"Short blistered breeches, and those types of travel,"
199,"And understand again like honest men,"
200,"Or pack to their old playfellows. There, I take it,"
201,"They may, _cum privilegio, oui_ away"
202,The lag end of their lewdness and be laughed at.
203,"’Tis time to give ’em physic, their diseases"
204,Are grown so catching.
205,What a loss our ladies
206,Will have of these trim vanities!
207,"There will be woe indeed, lords. The sly whoresons"
208,Have got a speeding trick to lay down ladies.
209,A French song and a fiddle has no fellow.
210,"The devil fiddle ’em! I am glad they are going,"
211,"For sure, there’s no converting of ’em. Now"
212,"An honest country lord, as I am, beaten"
213,"A long time out of play, may bring his plainsong"
214,"And have an hour of hearing, and, by ’r Lady,"
215,Held current music too.
216,"Well said, Lord Sandys."
217,Your colt’s tooth is not cast yet.
218,Nor shall not while I have a stump.
219,Whither were you a-going?
220,Your lordship is a guest too.
221,"This night he makes a supper, and a great one,"
222,To many lords and ladies. There will be
223,"The beauty of this kingdom, I’ll assure you."
224,"That churchman bears a bounteous mind indeed,"
225,A hand as fruitful as the land that feeds us.
226,His dews fall everywhere.
227,No doubt he’s noble;
228,He had a black mouth that said other of him.
229,"He may, my lord; has wherewithal. In him"
230,Sparing would show a worse sin than ill doctrine.
231,Men of his way should be most liberal;
232,They are set here for examples.
233,"True, they are so,"
234,But few now give so great ones. My barge stays.
235,"Your lordship shall along. Come, good Sir Thomas,"
236,"We shall be late else, which I would not be,"
237,"For I was spoke to, with Sir Henry Guildford,"
238,This night to be comptrollers.
239,I am your lordship’s.
240,SCENE IV. A Hall in York Place.
241,"Hautboys. A small table under a state for the Cardinal, a longer table"
242,for the guests. Then enter Anne Bullen and divers other Ladies and
243,"Gentlemen as guests, at one door. At another door enter Sir Henry"
244,"Ladies, a general welcome from his Grace"
245,Salutes ye all. This night he dedicates
246,"To fair content and you. None here, he hopes,"
247,In all this noble bevy has brought with her
248,One care abroad. He would have all as merry
249,"As, first, good company, good wine, good welcome"
250,Can make good people.
251,"Enter Lord Chamberlain, Lord Sandys and Sir Thomas Lovell."
252,"O, my lord, you’re tardy."
253,The very thought of this fair company
254,Clapped wings to me.
255,"You are young, Sir Harry Guildford."
256,"Sir Thomas Lovell, had the Cardinal"
257,"But half my lay thoughts in him, some of these"
258,"Should find a running banquet ere they rested,"
259,"I think would better please ’em. By my life,"
260,They are a sweet society of fair ones.
261,"O, that your lordship were but now confessor"
262,To one or two of these!
263,I would I were.
264,They should find easy penance.
265,As easy as a down bed would afford it.
266,"Sweet ladies, will it please you sit? Sir Harry,"
267,Place you that side; I’ll take the charge of this.
268,"His Grace is ent’ring. Nay, you must not freeze;"
269,Two women placed together makes cold weather.
270,"My Lord Sandys, you are one will keep ’em waking."
271,"Pray, sit between these ladies."
272,"And thank your lordship. By your leave, sweet ladies."
273,"If I chance to talk a little wild, forgive me;"
274,I had it from my father.
275,"Was he mad, sir?"
276,"O, very mad, exceeding mad in love too;"
277,"But he would bite none. Just as I do now,"
278,He would kiss you twenty with a breath.
279,"Well said, my lord."
280,"So, now you’re fairly seated. gentlemen,"
281,The penance lies on you if these fair ladies
282,"For my little cure,"
283,Hautboys. Enter Cardinal Wolsey and takes his state.
284,"You’re welcome, my fair guests. That noble lady"
285,Or gentleman that is not freely merry
286,"Is not my friend. This, to confirm my welcome;"
287,"And to you all, good health."
288,Your Grace is noble.
289,Let me have such a bowl may hold my thanks
290,And save me so much talking.
291,I am beholding to you. Cheer your neighbours.
292,"Ladies, you are not merry. Gentlemen,"
293,Whose fault is this?
294,The red wine first must rise
295,"In their fair cheeks, my lord; then we shall have ’em"
296,Talk us to silence.
297,"You are a merry gamester,"
298,"Yes, if I make my play."
299,"Here’s to your ladyship; and pledge it, madam,"
300,For ’tis to such a thing—
301,You cannot show me.
302,I told your Grace they would talk anon.
303,"Look out there, some of ye."
304,"And to what end, is this? Nay, ladies, fear not."
305,By all the laws of war you’re privileged.
306,"How now, what is’t?"
307,"A noble troop of strangers,"
308,"For so they seem. They’ve left their barge and landed,"
309,"And hither make, as great ambassadors"
310,"Go, give ’em welcome—you can speak the French tongue—"
311,"And pray receive ’em nobly, and conduct ’em"
312,"Into our presence, where this heaven of beauty"
313,Shall shine at full upon them. Some attend him.
314,"You have now a broken banquet, but we’ll mend it."
315,A good digestion to you all; and once more
316,I shower a welcome on ye. Welcome all!
317,"Hautboys. Enter King and others as masquers, habited like shepherds,"
318,ushered by the Lord Chamberlain. They pass directly before the Cardinal
319,and gracefully salute him.
320,A noble company! What are their pleasures?
321,"Because they speak no English, thus they prayed"
322,To tell your Grace: that having heard by fame
323,Of this so noble and so fair assembly
324,"This night to meet here, they could do no less,"
325,"Out of the great respect they bear to beauty,"
326,"But leave their flocks and, under your fair conduct,"
327,Crave leave to view these ladies and entreat
328,An hour of revels with ’em.
329,They have done my poor house grace; for which I pay ’em
330,A thousand thanks and pray ’em take their pleasures.
331,"The fairest hand I ever touched! O beauty,"
332,Till now I never knew thee.
333,Pray tell ’em thus much from me:
334,"There should be one amongst ’em, by his person"
335,"More worthy this place than myself, to whom,"
336,"If I but knew him, with my love and duty"
337,I would surrender it.
338,"I will, my lord."
339,Such a one they all confess
340,"There is indeed, which they would have your Grace"
341,"Find out, and he will take it."
342,"Let me see, then."
343,"By all your good leaves, gentlemen; here I’ll make"
344,"You hold a fair assembly; you do well, lord."
345,"You are a churchman, or I’ll tell you, Cardinal,"
346,I should judge now unhappily.
347,Your Grace is grown so pleasant.
348,Prithee come hither. What fair lady’s that?
349,"An’t please your Grace, Sir Thomas Bullen’s daughter,"
350,"The Viscount Rochford, one of her Highness’ women."
351,"By heaven, she is a dainty one. Sweetheart,"
352,I were unmannerly to take you out
353,"And not to kiss you. A health, gentlemen!"
354,Let it go round.
355,"Sir Thomas Lovell, is the banquet ready"
356,I’ th’ privy chamber?
357,"I fear, with dancing is a little heated."
358,"I fear, too much."
359,"There’s fresher air, my lord,"
360,In the next chamber.
361,"Lead in your ladies, every one. Sweet partner,"
362,"I must not yet forsake you. Let’s be merry,"
363,"Good my Lord Cardinal, I have half a dozen healths"
364,"To drink to these fair ladies, and a measure"
365,"To lead ’em once again, and then let’s dream"
366,Who’s best in favour. Let the music knock it.
367,SCENE I. Westminster. A street.
368,Enter two Gentlemen at several doors.
369,Whither away so fast?
370,"O, God save ye."
371,"Even to the Hall, to hear what shall become"
372,Of the great Duke of Buckingham.
373,"That labour, sir. All’s now done but the ceremony"
374,Of bringing back the prisoner.
375,"Yes, indeed, was I."
376,Pray speak what has happened.
377,You may guess quickly what.
378,Is he found guilty?
379,"Yes, truly is he, and condemned upon’t."
380,I am sorry for’t.
381,So are a number more.
382,"But pray, how passed it?"
383,I’ll tell you in a little. The great Duke
384,"Came to the bar, where to his accusations"
385,He pleaded still not guilty and alleged
386,Many sharp reasons to defeat the law.
387,The King’s attorney on the contrary
388,"Urged on the examinations, proofs, confessions"
389,"Of divers witnesses, which the Duke desired"
390,To have brought _viva voce_ to his face;
391,"At which appeared against him his surveyor,"
392,"Sir Gilbert Peck his chancellor, and John Car,"
393,"Confessor to him, with that devil monk,"
394,"Hopkins, that made this mischief."
395,That fed him with his prophecies?
396,"All these accused him strongly, which he fain"
397,"Would have flung from him, but, indeed he could not."
398,"And so his peers, upon this evidence,"
399,Have found him guilty of high treason. Much
400,"He spoke, and learnedly, for life, but all"
401,Was either pitied in him or forgotten.
402,"After all this, how did he bear himself?"
403,When he was brought again to th’ bar to hear
404,"His knell rung out, his judgement, he was stirred"
405,"With such an agony, he sweat extremely"
406,"And something spoke in choler, ill and hasty."
407,"But he fell to himself again, and sweetly"
408,In all the rest showed a most noble patience.
409,I do not think he fears death.
410,Sure he does not;
411,He never was so womanish. The cause
412,He may a little grieve at.
413,The Cardinal is the end of this.
414,"By all conjectures: first, Kildare’s attainder,"
415,"Then deputy of Ireland, who removed,"
416,"Earl Surrey was sent thither, and in haste too,"
417,Lest he should help his father.
418,That trick of state
419,Was a deep envious one.
420,"No doubt he will requite it. This is noted,"
421,"And generally, whoever the King favours,"
422,"The Cardinal instantly will find employment,"
423,And far enough from court too.
424,"Hate him perniciously and, o’ my conscience,"
425,Wish him ten fathom deep. This duke as much
426,"They love and dote on, call him bounteous Buckingham,"
427,The mirror of all courtesy.
428,"Enter Buckingham from his arraignment. Tipstaves before him, the axe"
429,"with the edge towards him, Halberds on each side, accompanied with Sir"
430,"Thomas Lovell, Sir Nicholas Vaux, Sir William Sandys and common people."
431,And see the noble ruined man you speak of.
432,Let’s stand close and behold him.
433,"You that thus far have come to pity me,"
434,"Hear what I say, and then go home and lose me."
435,"I have this day received a traitor’s judgement,"
436,"And by that name must die; yet heaven bear witness,"
437,"And if I have a conscience, let it sink me,"
438,"Even as the axe falls, if I be not faithful!"
439,The law I bear no malice for my death;
440,"’T has done, upon the premises, but justice."
441,But those that sought it I could wish more Christians.
442,"Be what they will, I heartily forgive ’em."
443,"Yet let ’em look they glory not in mischief,"
444,"Nor build their evils on the graves of great men,"
445,For then my guiltless blood must cry against ’em.
446,"For further life in this world I ne’er hope,"
447,"Nor will I sue, although the King have mercies"
448,More than I dare make faults. You few that loved me
449,"And dare be bold to weep for Buckingham,"
450,"His noble friends and fellows, whom to leave"
451,"Is only bitter to him, only dying,"
452,"Go with me like good angels to my end,"
453,"And as the long divorce of steel falls on me,"
454,"Make of your prayers one sweet sacrifice,"
455,"And lift my soul to heaven. Lead on, i’ God’s name."
456,"I do beseech your Grace, for charity,"
457,If ever any malice in your heart
458,"Were hid against me, now to forgive me frankly."
459,"Sir Thomas Lovell, I as free forgive you"
460,As I would be forgiven. I forgive all.
461,There cannot be those numberless offences
462,’Gainst me that I cannot take peace with. No black envy
463,"Shall mark my grave. Commend me to his Grace,"
464,"And if he speak of Buckingham, pray tell him"
465,You met him half in heaven. My vows and prayers
466,"Yet are the King’s and, till my soul forsake,"
467,Shall cry for blessings on him. May he live
468,Longer than I have time to tell his years;
469,Ever beloved and loving may his rule be;
470,"And when old Time shall lead him to his end,"
471,Goodness and he fill up one monument!
472,"To th’ waterside I must conduct your Grace,"
473,"Then give my charge up to Sir Nicholas Vaux,"
474,Who undertakes you to your end.
475,"The Duke is coming. See the barge be ready,"
476,And fit it with such furniture as suits
477,The greatness of his person.
478,Let it alone. My state now will but mock me.
479,"When I came hither, I was Lord High Constable"
480,"And Duke of Buckingham; now, poor Edward Bohun."
481,"Yet I am richer than my base accusers,"
482,"That never knew what truth meant. I now seal it,"
483,And with that blood will make ’em one day groan for’t.
484,"My noble father, Henry of Buckingham,"
485,"Who first raised head against usurping Richard,"
486,"Flying for succour to his servant Banister,"
487,"Being distressed, was by that wretch betrayed,"
488,"And, without trial, fell. God’s peace be with him."
489,"Henry the Seventh succeeding, truly pitying"
490,"My father’s loss, like a most royal prince,"
491,Restored me to my honours and out of ruins
492,"Made my name once more noble. Now his son,"
493,"Henry the Eighth, life, honour, name, and all"
494,That made me happy at one stroke has taken
495,"For ever from the world. I had my trial,"
496,"And must needs say a noble one, which makes me"
497,A little happier than my wretched father.
498,Yet thus far we are one in fortunes: both
499,"Fell by our servants, by those men we loved most—"
500,A most unnatural and faithless service.
501,"Heaven has an end in all; yet, you that hear me,"
502,This from a dying man receive as certain:
503,Where you are liberal of your loves and counsels
504,Be sure you be not loose; for those you make friends
505,"And give your hearts to, when they once perceive"
506,"The least rub in your fortunes, fall away"
507,"Like water from ye, never found again"
508,"But where they mean to sink ye. All good people,"
509,Pray for me. I must now forsake ye. The last hour
510,Of my long weary life is come upon me.
511,"Farewell. And when you would say something that is sad,"
512,Speak how I fell. I have done; and God forgive me.
513,"O, this is full of pity. Sir, it calls,"
514,"I fear, too many curses on their heads"
515,That were the authors.
516,"If the Duke be guiltless,"
517,’Tis full of woe. Yet I can give you inkling
518,"Of an ensuing evil, if it fall,"
519,Good angels keep it from us!
520,"What may it be? You do not doubt my faith, sir?"
521,"This secret is so weighty, ’twill require"
522,A strong faith to conceal it.
523,Let me have it.
524,I do not talk much.
525,"You shall, sir. Did you not of late days hear"
526,A buzzing of a separation
527,Between the King and Katherine?
528,"Yes, but it held not;"
529,"For when the King once heard it, out of anger"
530,He sent command to the Lord Mayor straight
531,To stop the rumour and allay those tongues
532,That durst disperse it.
533,"But that slander, sir,"
534,"Is found a truth now, for it grows again"
535,"Fresher than e’er it was, and held for certain"
536,"The King will venture at it. Either the Cardinal,"
537,"Or some about him near, have, out of malice"
538,"To the good Queen, possessed him with a scruple"
539,"That will undo her. To confirm this too,"
540,"Cardinal Campeius is arrived, and lately,"
541,"As all think, for this business."
542,And merely to revenge him on the Emperor
543,"For not bestowing on him at his asking,"
544,The archbishopric of Toledo this is purposed.
545,I think you have hit the mark. But is’t not cruel
546,That she should feel the smart of this? The Cardinal
547,"Will have his will, and she must fall."
548,We are too open here to argue this.
549,Let’s think in private more.
550,SCENE II. An ante-chamber in the palace.
551,"Enter Lord Chamberlain, reading this letter."
552,"_My lord, the horses your lordship sent for, with all the care had I"
553,"saw well chosen, ridden, and furnished. They were young and handsome,"
554,and of the best breed in the north. When they were ready to set out for
555,"London, a man of my Lord Cardinal’s, by commission and main power, took"
556,"’em from me, with this reason: his master would be served before a"
557,"subject, if not before the King; which stopped our mouths, sir._"
558,"I fear he will indeed. Well, let him have them."
559,"He will have all, I think."
560,"Enter to the Lord Chamberlain, the Dukes of Norfolk and Suffolk."
561,"Well met, my Lord Chamberlain."
562,Good day to both your Graces.
563,How is the King employed?
564,"I left him private,"
565,Full of sad thoughts and troubles.
566,It seems the marriage with his brother’s wife
567,Has crept too near his conscience.
568,Has crept too near another lady.
569,"This is the Cardinal’s doing, the king-cardinal."
570,"That blind priest, like the eldest son of Fortune,"
571,Turns what he list. The King will know him one day.
572,Pray God he do! He’ll never know himself else.
573,"How holily he works in all his business,"
574,"And with what zeal! For, now he has cracked the league"
575,"Between us and the Emperor, the Queen’s great nephew,"
576,He dives into the King’s soul and there scatters
577,"Dangers, doubts, wringing of the conscience,"
578,Fears and despairs—and all these for his marriage.
579,"And out of all these to restore the King,"
580,"He counsels a divorce, a loss of her"
581,That like a jewel has hung twenty years
582,"About his neck, yet never lost her lustre;"
583,Of her that loves him with that excellence
584,That angels love good men with; even of her
585,"That, when the greatest stroke of fortune falls,"
586,Will bless the King. And is not this course pious?
587,Heaven keep me from such counsel! ’Tis most true:
588,"These news are everywhere, every tongue speaks ’em,"
589,And every true heart weeps for’t. All that dare
590,"Look into these affairs see this main end,"
591,The French king’s sister. Heaven will one day open
592,"The King’s eyes, that so long have slept upon"
593,This bold bad man.
594,And free us from his slavery.
595,"We had need pray,"
596,"And heartily, for our deliverance,"
597,Or this imperious man will work us all
598,From princes into pages. All men’s honours
599,"Lie like one lump before him, to be fashioned"
600,Into what pitch he please.
601,"For me, my lords,"
602,"I love him not, nor fear him; there’s my creed."
603,"As I am made without him, so I’ll stand,"
604,If the King please. His curses and his blessings
605,"Touch me alike, they’re breath I not believe in."
606,"I knew him, and I know him; so I leave him"
607,"To him that made him proud, the Pope."
608,And with some other business put the King
609,From these sad thoughts that work too much upon him.
610,"My lord, you’ll bear us company?"
611,"The King has sent me otherwhere. Besides,"
612,You’ll find a most unfit time to disturb him.
613,Health to your lordships.
614,"Thanks, my good Lord Chamberlain."
615,"[_Exit Lord Chamberlain, and the King draws the curtain and sits"
616,"How sad he looks! Sure, he is much afflicted."
617,Pray God he be not angry.
618,"Who’s there, I say? How dare you thrust yourselves"
619,Into my private meditations?
620,Who am I? Ha?
621,A gracious king that pardons all offences
622,Malice ne’er meant. Our breach of duty this way
623,"Is business of estate, in which we come"
624,To know your royal pleasure.
625,Ye are too bold.
626,Go to; I’ll make ye know your times of business.
627,"Is this an hour for temporal affairs, ha?"
628,Enter Wolsey and Campeius with a commission.
629,"Who’s there? My good Lord Cardinal? O my Wolsey,"
630,"The quiet of my wounded conscience,"
631,"Thou art a cure fit for a king. [_To Campeius_.] You’re welcome,"
632,"Most learned reverend sir, into our kingdom;"
633,"Use us and it. [_To Wolsey_.] My good lord, have great care"
634,I be not found a talker.
635,I would your Grace would give us but an hour
636,"I would not be so sick, though, for his place."
637,But this cannot continue.
638,I’ll venture one have-at-him.
639,Your Grace has given a precedent of wisdom
640,Above all princes in committing freely
641,Your scruple to the voice of Christendom.
642,Who can be angry now? What envy reach you?
643,"The Spaniard, tied by blood and favour to her,"
644,"Must now confess, if they have any goodness,"
645,The trial just and noble. All the clerks—
646,I mean the learned ones in Christian kingdoms—
647,"Have their free voices. Rome, the nurse of judgement,"
648,"Invited by your noble self, hath sent"
649,"One general tongue unto us, this good man,"
650,"This just and learned priest, Cardinal Campeius,"
651,Whom once more I present unto your Highness.
652,"And once more in mine arms I bid him welcome,"
653,And thank the holy conclave for their loves.
654,They have sent me such a man I would have wished for.
655,"Your Grace must needs deserve all strangers’ loves,"
656,You are so noble. To your Highness’ hand
657,"I tender my commission, by whose virtue,"
658,"The court of Rome commanding, you, my Lord"
659,"Cardinal of York, are joined with me their servant"
660,In the unpartial judging of this business.
661,Two equal men. The Queen shall be acquainted
662,Forthwith for what you come. Where’s Gardiner?
663,I know your Majesty has always loved her
664,So dear in heart not to deny her that
665,A woman of less place might ask by law:
666,Scholars allowed freely to argue for her.
667,"Ay, and the best she shall have, and my favour"
668,"To him that does best. God forbid else. Cardinal,"
669,"Prithee call Gardiner to me, my new secretary."
670,I find him a fit fellow.
671,Give me your hand. Much joy and favour to you;
672,You are the King’s now.
673,"For ever by your Grace, whose hand has raised me."
674,"My lord of York, was not one Doctor Pace"
675,In this man’s place before him?
676,Was he not held a learned man?
677,"Believe me, there’s an ill opinion spread, then"
678,"Even of yourself, Lord Cardinal."
679,They will not stick to say you envied him
680,And fearing he would rise—he was so virtuous—
681,"Kept him a foreign man still, which so grieved him"
682,That he ran mad and died.
683,Heav’n’s peace be with him!
684,That’s Christian care enough. For living murmurers
685,"There’s places of rebuke. He was a fool,"
686,"For he would needs be virtuous. That good fellow,"
687,"If I command him, follows my appointment."
688,"I will have none so near else. Learn this, brother:"
689,We live not to be griped by meaner persons.
690,Deliver this with modesty to th’ Queen.
691,The most convenient place that I can think of
692,For such receipt of learning is Blackfriars.
693,There ye shall meet about this weighty business.
694,"My Wolsey, see it furnished. O, my lord,"
695,Would it not grieve an able man to leave
696,"So sweet a bedfellow? But, conscience, conscience!"
697,"O, ’tis a tender place, and I must leave her."
698,SCENE III. An ante-chamber of the Queen’s apartments.
699,Enter Anne Bullen and an Old Lady.
700,Not for that neither. Here’s the pang that pinches:
701,"His Highness having lived so long with her, and she"
702,So good a lady that no tongue could ever
703,"Pronounce dishonour of her—by my life,"
704,"She never knew harm-doing—O, now, after"
705,"So many courses of the sun enthroned,"
706,"Still growing in a majesty and pomp, the which"
707,To leave a thousandfold more bitter than
708,"’Tis sweet at first t’ acquire—after this process,"
709,"To give her the avaunt, it is a pity"
710,Would move a monster.
711,Hearts of most hard temper
712,Melt and lament for her.
713,"O, God’s will! Much better"
714,"She ne’er had known pomp; though’t be temporal,"
715,"Yet if that quarrel, Fortune, do divorce"
716,"It from the bearer, ’tis a sufferance panging"
717,As soul and body’s severing.
718,She’s a stranger now again.
719,So much the more
720,"Must pity drop upon her. Verily,"
721,"I swear, ’tis better to be lowly born"
722,And range with humble livers in content
723,"Than to be perked up in a glist’ring grief,"
724,And wear a golden sorrow.
725,Is our best having.
726,"By my troth and maidenhead,"
727,I would not be a queen.
728,"Beshrew me, I would,"
729,"And venture maidenhead for’t; and so would you,"
730,For all this spice of your hypocrisy.
731,"You, that have so fair parts of woman on you,"
732,"Have too a woman’s heart, which ever yet"
733,"Affected eminence, wealth, sovereignty;"
734,"Which, to say sooth, are blessings; and which gifts,"
735,"Saving your mincing, the capacity"
736,"Of your soft cheveril conscience would receive,"
737,If you might please to stretch it.
738,"Yes, troth and troth. You would not be a queen?"
739,"No, not for all the riches under heaven."
740,"’Tis strange. A threepence bowed would hire me,"
741,"Old as I am, to queen it. But I pray you,"
742,What think you of a duchess? Have you limbs
743,To bear that load of title?
744,Then you are weakly made. Pluck off a little.
745,I would not be a young count in your way
746,For more than blushing comes to. If your back
747,"Cannot vouchsafe this burden, ’tis too weak"
748,Ever to get a boy.
749,How you do talk!
750,I swear again I would not be a queen
751,For all the world.
752,"In faith, for little England"
753,You’d venture an emballing. I myself
754,"Would for Caernarfonshire, although there longed"
755,"No more to th’ crown but that. Lo, who comes here?"
756,"Good morrow, ladies. What were’t worth to know"
757,The secret of your conference?
758,Not your demand; it values not your asking.
759,Our mistress’ sorrows we were pitying.
760,"It was a gentle business, and becoming"
761,The action of good women. There is hope
762,All will be well.
763,"Now, I pray God, amen!"
764,"You bear a gentle mind, and heavenly blessings"
765,"Follow such creatures. That you may, fair lady,"
766,"Perceive I speak sincerely, and high note’s"
767,"Ta’en of your many virtues, the King’s Majesty"
768,"Commends his good opinion of you, and"
769,Does purpose honour to you no less flowing
770,"Than Marchioness of Pembroke, to which title"
771,A thousand pound a year annual support
772,Out of his grace he adds.
773,I do not know
774,What kind of my obedience I should tender.
775,More than my all is nothing; nor my prayers
776,"Are not words duly hallowed, nor my wishes"
777,More worth than empty vanities; yet prayers and wishes
778,"Are all I can return. Beseech your lordship,"
779,"Vouchsafe to speak my thanks and my obedience,"
780,"As from a blushing handmaid, to his Highness,"
781,Whose health and royalty I pray for.
782,I shall not fail t’ approve the fair conceit
783,The King hath of you. [_Aside_.] I have perused her well.
784,Beauty and honour in her are so mingled
785,That they have caught the King; and who knows yet
786,But from this lady may proceed a gem
787,"To lighten all this isle? I’ll to the King,"
788,And say I spoke with you.
789,"Why, this it is: see, see!"
790,"I have been begging sixteen years in court,"
791,"Am yet a courtier beggarly, nor could"
792,Come pat betwixt too early and too late
793,"For any suit of pounds; and you, O fate!"
794,"A very fresh fish here—fie, fie, fie upon"
795,This compelled fortune!—have your mouth filled up
796,Before you open it.
797,This is strange to me.
798,"How tastes it? Is it bitter? Forty pence, no."
799,There was a lady once—’tis an old story—
800,"That would not be a queen, that would she not,"
801,For all the mud in Egypt. Have you heard it?
802,"Come, you are pleasant."
803,"With your theme, I could"
804,O’ermount the lark. The Marchioness of Pembroke?
805,A thousand pounds a year for pure respect?
806,"No other obligation? By my life,"
807,That promises more thousands; honour’s train
808,Is longer than his foreskirt. By this time
809,"I know your back will bear a duchess. Say,"
810,Are you not stronger than you were?
811,"Make yourself mirth with your particular fancy,"
812,And leave me out on’t. Would I had no being
813,If this salute my blood a jot. It faints me
814,To think what follows.
815,"The Queen is comfortless, and we forgetful"
816,In our long absence. Pray do not deliver
817,What here you’ve heard to her.
818,What do you think me?
819,SCENE IV. A hall in Blackfriars.
820,"Trumpets, sennet, and cornets. Enter two Vergers, with short silver"
821,"wands; next them, two Scribes, in the habit of doctors; after them, the"
822,"Archbishop of Canterbury alone; after him, the Bishops of Lincoln, Ely,"
823,"Rochester, and Saint Asaph; next them, with some small distance,"
824,"follows a Gentleman bearing the purse with the great seal, and a"
825,"cardinal’s hat; then two Priests, bearing each a silver cross; then a"
826,"Gentleman Usher bare-headed, accompanied with a Sergeant-at-arms"
827,"bearing a silver mace; then two Gentlemen, bearing two great silver"
828,"pillars; after them, side by side, the two Cardinals; two Noblemen with"
829,the sword and mace. The King takes place under the cloth of state. The
830,two Cardinals sit under him as judges. The Queen takes place some
831,distance from the King. The Bishops place themselves on each side the
832,"court, in manner of consistory; below them the Scribes. The Lords sit"
833,next the Bishops. The rest of the Attendants stand in convenient order
834,"Whilst our commission from Rome is read,"
835,Let silence be commanded.
836,"It hath already publicly been read,"
837,And on all sides th’ authority allowed;
838,You may then spare that time.
839,"Say, “Henry King of England, come into the court.”"
840,"Henry King of England, come into the court."
841,"Say, “Katherine Queen of England, come into the court.”"
842,"Katherine Queen of England, come into the court."
843,"[_The Queen makes no answer, rises out of her chair, goes about the"
844,"court, comes to the King, and kneels at his feet; then speaks._]"
845,"Sir, I desire you do me right and justice,"
846,And to bestow your pity on me; for
847,"I am a most poor woman and a stranger,"
848,"Born out of your dominions, having here"
849,No judge indifferent nor no more assurance
850,"Of equal friendship and proceeding. Alas, sir,"
851,In what have I offended you? What cause
852,Hath my behaviour given to your displeasure
853,That thus you should proceed to put me off
854,And take your good grace from me? Heaven witness
855,"I have been to you a true and humble wife,"
856,"At all times to your will conformable,"
857,"Ever in fear to kindle your dislike,"
858,"Yea, subject to your countenance, glad or sorry"
859,As I saw it inclined. When was the hour
860,"I ever contradicted your desire,"
861,Or made it not mine too? Or which of your friends
862,"Have I not strove to love, although I knew"
863,He were mine enemy? What friend of mine
864,That had to him derived your anger did I
865,"Continue in my liking? Nay, gave notice"
866,"He was from thence discharged? Sir, call to mind"
867,That I have been your wife in this obedience
868,"Upward of twenty years, and have been blessed"
869,"With many children by you. If, in the course"
870,"And process of this time, you can report,"
871,"And prove it too, against mine honour aught,"
872,"My bond to wedlock, or my love and duty"
873,"Against your sacred person, in God’s name,"
874,Turn me away and let the foul’st contempt
875,"Shut door upon me, and so give me up"
876,"To the sharp’st kind of justice. Please you, sir,"
877,The King your father was reputed for
878,"A prince most prudent, of an excellent"
879,"And unmatched wit and judgement. Ferdinand,"
880,"My father, King of Spain, was reckoned one"
881,The wisest prince that there had reigned by many
882,A year before. It is not to be questioned
883,That they had gathered a wise council to them
884,"Of every realm, that did debate this business,"
885,Who deemed our marriage lawful. Wherefore I humbly
886,"Beseech you, sir, to spare me till I may"
887,"Be by my friends in Spain advised, whose counsel"
888,"I will implore. If not, i’ th’ name of God,"
889,Your pleasure be fulfilled.
890,"You have here, lady,"
891,"And of your choice, these reverend fathers, men"
892,"Of singular integrity and learning,"
893,"Yea, the elect o’ th’ land, who are assembled"
894,To plead your cause. It shall be therefore bootless
895,"That longer you desire the court, as well"
896,For your own quiet as to rectify
897,What is unsettled in the King.
898,"Hath spoken well and justly. Therefore, madam,"
899,"It’s fit this royal session do proceed,"
900,And that without delay their arguments
901,Be now produced and heard.
902,To you I speak.
903,"I am about to weep; but, thinking that"
904,"We are a queen, or long have dreamed so, certain"
905,"The daughter of a king, my drops of tears"
906,I’ll turn to sparks of fire.
907,"I will, when you are humble; nay, before,"
908,"Or God will punish me. I do believe,"
909,"Induced by potent circumstances, that"
910,"You are mine enemy, and make my challenge"
911,You shall not be my judge; for it is you
912,"Have blown this coal betwixt my lord and me,"
913,"Which God’s dew quench! Therefore I say again,"
914,"I utterly abhor, yea, from my soul"
915,"Refuse you for my judge, whom, yet once more,"
916,I hold my most malicious foe and think not
917,At all a friend to truth.
918,"You speak not like yourself, who ever yet"
919,Have stood to charity and displayed th’ effects
920,Of disposition gentle and of wisdom
921,"O’ertopping woman’s power. Madam, you do me wrong."
922,"I have no spleen against you, nor injustice"
923,"For you or any. How far I have proceeded,"
924,"Or how far further shall, is warranted"
925,"By a commission from the Consistory,"
926,"Yea, the whole Consistory of Rome. You charge me"
927,That I have “blown this coal”. I do deny it.
928,The King is present. If it be known to him
929,"That I gainsay my deed, how may he wound,"
930,"And worthily, my falsehood, yea, as much"
931,As you have done my truth. If he know
932,"That I am free of your report, he knows"
933,I am not of your wrong. Therefore in him
934,"It lies to cure me, and the cure is to"
935,"Remove these thoughts from you, the which before"
936,"His Highness shall speak in, I do beseech"
937,"You, gracious madam, to unthink your speaking"
938,And to say so no more.
939,"My lord, my lord,"
940,"I am a simple woman, much too weak"
941,T’ oppose your cunning. You’re meek and humble-mouthed;
942,"You sign your place and calling, in full seeming,"
943,With meekness and humility; but your heart
944,"Is crammed with arrogancy, spleen, and pride."
945,"You have, by fortune and his Highness’ favours,"
946,"Gone slightly o’er low steps, and now are mounted"
947,"Where powers are your retainers, and your words,"
948,"Domestics to you, serve your will as ’t please"
949,"Yourself pronounce their office. I must tell you,"
950,You tender more your person’s honour than
951,Your high profession spiritual; that again
952,"I do refuse you for my judge; and here,"
953,"Before you all, appeal unto the Pope,"
954,"To bring my whole cause ’fore his Holiness,"
955,And to be judged by him.
956,"The Queen is obstinate,"
957,"Stubborn to justice, apt to accuse it, and"
958,Disdainful to be tried by’t. ’Tis not well.
959,"Katherine, Queen of England, come into the court."
960,"Madam, you are called back."
961,What need you note it? Pray you keep your way.
962,"When you are called, return. Now, the Lord help!"
963,"They vex me past my patience. Pray you, pass on."
964,"I will not tarry; no, nor ever more"
965,Upon this business my appearance make
966,In any of their courts.
967,"Go thy ways, Kate."
968,That man i’ th’ world who shall report he has
969,"A better wife, let him in naught be trusted,"
970,"For speaking false in that. Thou art, alone—"
971,"If thy rare qualities, sweet gentleness,"
972,"Thy meekness saint-like, wife-like government,"
973,"Obeying in commanding, and thy parts"
974,"Sovereign and pious else, could speak thee out—"
975,"The queen of earthly queens. She’s noble born,"
976,And like her true nobility she has
977,Carried herself towards me.
978,In humblest manner I require your Highness
979,"That it shall please you to declare, in hearing"
980,"Of all these ears—for where I am robbed and bound,"
981,"There must I be unloosed, although not there"
982,At once and fully satisfied—whether ever I
983,"Did broach this business to your Highness, or"
984,Laid any scruple in your way which might
985,Induce you to the question on’t? or ever
986,"Have to you, but with thanks to God for such"
987,"A royal lady, spake one the least word that might"
988,"Be to the prejudice of her present state,"
989,Or touch of her good person?
990,"I do excuse you; yea, upon mine honour,"
991,I free you from’t. You are not to be taught
992,That you have many enemies that know not
993,"Why they are so, but, like to village curs,"
994,Bark when their fellows do. By some of these
995,The Queen is put in anger. You’re excused.
996,But will you be more justified? You ever
997,"Have wished the sleeping of this business, never desired"
998,"It to be stirred, but oft have hindered, oft,"
999,"The passages made toward it. On my honour,"
1000,I speak my good Lord Cardinal to this point
1001,"And thus far clear him. Now, what moved me to’t,"
1002,I will be bold with time and your attention.
1003,Then mark th’ inducement. Thus it came; give heed to’t:
1004,"My conscience first received a tenderness,"
1005,"Scruple, and prick on certain speeches uttered"
1006,"By th’ Bishop of Bayonne, then French ambassador,"
1007,Who had been hither sent on the debating
1008,A marriage ’twixt the Duke of Orleans and
1009,"Our daughter Mary. I’ th’ progress of this business,"
1010,"Ere a determinate resolution, he,"
1011,"I mean the Bishop, did require a respite,"
1012,Wherein he might the King his lord advertise
1013,"Whether our daughter were legitimate,"
1014,"Respecting this our marriage with the dowager,"
1015,Sometimes our brother’s wife. This respite shook
1016,"The bosom of my conscience, entered me,"
1017,"Yea, with a splitting power, and made to tremble"
1018,The region of my breast; which forced such way
1019,That many mazed considerings did throng
1020,"And pressed in with this caution. First, methought"
1021,"I stood not in the smile of heaven, who had"
1022,"Commanded nature that my lady’s womb,"
1023,"If it conceived a male child by me, should"
1024,Do no more offices of life to’t than
1025,The grave does to th’ dead; for her male issue
1026,"Or died where they were made, or shortly after"
1027,This world had aired them. Hence I took a thought
1028,"This was a judgement on me, that my kingdom,"
1029,"Well worthy the best heir o’ th’ world, should not"
1030,Be gladded in’t by me. Then follows that
1031,I weighed the danger which my realms stood in
1032,"By this my issue’s fail, and that gave to me"
1033,Many a groaning throe. Thus hulling in
1034,"The wild sea of my conscience, I did steer"
1035,Toward this remedy whereupon we are
1036,"Now present here together. That’s to say,"
1037,"I meant to rectify my conscience, which"
1038,"I then did feel full sick, and yet not well,"
1039,By all the reverend fathers of the land
1040,And doctors learned. First I began in private
1041,"With you, my Lord of Lincoln. You remember"
1042,How under my oppression I did reek
1043,When I first moved you.
1044,"Very well, my liege."
1045,I have spoke long. Be pleased yourself to say
1046,How far you satisfied me.
1047,"So please your Highness,"
1048,"The question did at first so stagger me,"
1049,Bearing a state of mighty moment in’t
1050,"And consequence of dread, that I committed"
1051,The daring’st counsel which I had to doubt
1052,And did entreat your Highness to this course
1053,Which you are running here.
1054,"I then moved you,"
1055,"My Lord of Canterbury, and got your leave"
1056,To make this present summons. Unsolicited
1057,"I left no reverend person in this court,"
1058,But by particular consent proceeded
1059,"Under your hands and seals. Therefore go on,"
1060,For no dislike i’ th’ world against the person
1061,"Of the good queen, but the sharp thorny points"
1062,"Of my alleged reasons, drives this forward."
1063,"Prove but our marriage lawful, by my life"
1064,"And kingly dignity, we are contented"
1065,"To wear our mortal state to come with her,"
1066,"Katherine, our Queen, before the primest creature"
1067,That’s paragoned o’ th’ world.
1068,"So please your Highness,"
1069,"The Queen being absent, ’tis a needful fitness"
1070,That we adjourn this court till further day.
1071,Meanwhile must be an earnest motion
1072,Made to the Queen to call back her appeal
1073,She intends unto his Holiness.
1074,These cardinals trifle with me. I abhor
1075,This dilatory sloth and tricks of Rome.
1076,"My learned and well-beloved servant, Cranmer,"
1077,"Prithee return. With thy approach, I know,"
1078,My comfort comes along.—Break up the court!
1079,"I say, set on."
1080,SCENE I. London. The Queen’s apartments.
1081,"Enter Queen and her Women, as at work."
1082,"Take thy lute, wench. My soul grows sad with troubles."
1083,"Sing, and disperse ’em, if thou canst. Leave working."
1084,Orpheus with his lute made trees
1085,And the mountain tops that freeze
1086,Bow themselves when he did sing.
1087,To his music plants and flowers
1088,"Ever sprung, as sun and showers"
1089,There had made a lasting spring.
1090,"Everything that heard him play,"
1091,"Even the billows of the sea,"
1092,Hung their heads and then lay by.
1093,"In sweet music is such art,"
1094,Killing care and grief of heart
1095,"Fall asleep or, hearing, die."
1096,"An’t please your Grace, the two great Cardinals"
1097,Wait in the presence.
1098,Would they speak with me?
1099,"They willed me say so, madam."
1100,What can be their business
1101,"With me, a poor weak woman, fallen from favour?"
1102,"I do not like their coming. Now I think on’t,"
1103,"They should be good men, their affairs as righteous."
1104,But all hoods make not monks.
1105,"Enter the two Cardinals, Wolsey and Campeius."
1106,Peace to your Highness.
1107,Your Graces find me here part of housewife;
1108,"I would be all, against the worst may happen."
1109,"What are your pleasures with me, reverend lords?"
1110,"May it please you, noble madam, to withdraw"
1111,"Into your private chamber, we shall give you"
1112,The full cause of our coming.
1113,"There’s nothing I have done yet, o’ my conscience,"
1114,Deserves a corner. Would all other women
1115,Could speak this with as free a soul as I do!
1116,"My lords, I care not, so much I am happy"
1117,"Above a number, if my actions"
1118,"Were tried by every tongue, every eye saw ’em,"
1119,"Envy and base opinion set against ’em,"
1120,I know my life so even. If your business
1121,"Seek me out, and that way I am wife in,"
1122,Out with it boldly. Truth loves open dealing.
1123,"_Tanta est erga te mentis integritas, regina serenissima_—"
1124,"O, good my lord, no Latin."
1125,I am not such a truant since my coming
1126,As not to know the language I have lived in.
1127,"A strange tongue makes my cause more strange, suspicious."
1128,"Pray speak in English. Here are some will thank you,"
1129,"If you speak truth, for their poor mistress’ sake."
1130,"Believe me, she has had much wrong. Lord Cardinal,"
1131,The willing’st sin I ever yet committed
1132,May be absolved in English.
1133,I am sorry my integrity should breed—
1134,And service to his Majesty and you—
1135,"So deep suspicion, where all faith was meant."
1136,"We come not by the way of accusation,"
1137,"To taint that honour every good tongue blesses,"
1138,Nor to betray you any way to sorrow—
1139,"You have too much, good lady—but to know"
1140,How you stand minded in the weighty difference
1141,"Between the King and you, and to deliver,"
1142,"Like free and honest men, our just opinions"
1143,And comforts to your cause.
1144,"My Lord of York, out of his noble nature,"
1145,"Zeal, and obedience he still bore your Grace,"
1146,"Forgetting, like a good man, your late censure"
1147,Both of his truth and him—which was too far—
1148,"Offers, as I do, in a sign of peace,"
1149,His service and his counsel.
1150,"My lords, I thank you both for your good wills."
1151,Ye speak like honest men; pray God ye prove so.
1152,But how to make ye suddenly an answer
1153,"In such a point of weight, so near mine honour—"
1154,"More near my life, I fear—with my weak wit,"
1155,"And to such men of gravity and learning,"
1156,In truth I know not. I was set at work
1157,"Among my maids, full little, God knows, looking"
1158,Either for such men or such business.
1159,For her sake that I have been—for I feel
1160,"The last fit of my greatness—good your Graces,"
1161,Let me have time and counsel for my cause.
1162,"Alas, I am a woman friendless, hopeless."
1163,"Madam, you wrong the King’s love with these fears;"
1164,Your hopes and friends are infinite.
1165,"But little for my profit. Can you think, lords,"
1166,That any Englishman dare give me counsel?
1167,"Or be a known friend, ’gainst his Highness’ pleasure,"
1168,"Though he be grown so desperate to be honest,"
1169,"And live a subject? Nay, forsooth, my friends,"
1170,"They that much weigh out my afflictions,"
1171,"They that my trust must grow to, live not here."
1172,"They are, as all my other comforts, far hence"
1173,"In mine own country, lords."
1174,I would your Grace
1175,Would leave your griefs and take my counsel.
1176,Put your main cause into the King’s protection.
1177,He’s loving and most gracious. ’Twill be much
1178,"Both for your honour better and your cause,"
1179,"For if the trial of the law o’ertake ye,"
1180,You’ll part away disgraced.
1181,He tells you rightly.
1182,Ye tell me what ye wish for both: my ruin.
1183,Is this your Christian counsel? Out upon ye!
1184,Heaven is above all yet; there sits a judge
1185,That no king can corrupt.
1186,Your rage mistakes us.
1187,"The more shame for ye! Holy men I thought ye,"
1188,"Upon my soul, two reverend cardinal virtues;"
1189,But cardinal sins and hollow hearts I fear ye.
1190,"Mend ’em, for shame, my lords. Is this your comfort,"
1191,"The cordial that ye bring a wretched lady,"
1192,"A woman lost among ye, laughed at, scorned?"
1193,I will not wish ye half my miseries;
1194,I have more charity. But say I warned ye.
1195,"Take heed, for heaven’s sake, take heed, lest at once"
1196,The burden of my sorrows fall upon ye.
1197,"Madam, this is a mere distraction."
1198,You turn the good we offer into envy.
1199,Ye turn me into nothing. Woe upon ye
1200,And all such false professors! Would you have me—
1201,"If you have any justice, any pity,"
1202,If ye be anything but churchmen’s habits—
1203,Put my sick cause into his hands that hates me?
1204,"Alas, ’has banished me his bed already,"
1205,"His love, too, long ago. I am old, my lords,"
1206,And all the fellowship I hold now with him
1207,Is only my obedience. What can happen
1208,To me above this wretchedness? All your studies
1209,Make me a curse like this.
1210,Your fears are worse.
1211,"Have I lived thus long—let me speak myself,"
1212,"Since virtue finds no friends—a wife, a true one—"
1213,"A woman, I dare say without vainglory,"
1214,Never yet branded with suspicion—
1215,Have I with all my full affections
1216,"Still met the King, loved him next heav’n, obeyed him,"
1217,"Been, out of fondness, superstitious to him,"
1218,"Almost forgot my prayers to content him,"
1219,"And am I thus rewarded? ’Tis not well, lords."
1220,"Bring me a constant woman to her husband,"
1221,"One that ne’er dreamed a joy beyond his pleasure,"
1222,"And to that woman, when she has done most,"
1223,Yet will I add an honour: a great patience.
1224,"Madam, you wander from the good we aim at."
1225,"My lord, I dare not make myself so guilty"
1226,To give up willingly that noble title
1227,Your master wed me to. Nothing but death
1228,Shall e’er divorce my dignities.
1229,Would I had never trod this English earth
1230,Or felt the flatteries that grow upon it!
1231,"Ye have angels’ faces, but heaven knows your hearts."
1232,"What will become of me now, wretched lady?"
1233,I am the most unhappy woman living.
1234,"Shipwrecked upon a kingdom where no pity,"
1235,"No friends, no hope, no kindred weep for me,"
1236,"Almost no grave allowed me, like the lily"
1237,"That once was mistress of the field and flourished,"
1238,I’ll hang my head and perish.
1239,"Could but be brought to know our ends are honest,"
1240,"You’d feel more comfort. Why should we, good lady,"
1241,"Upon what cause, wrong you? Alas, our places,"
1242,"The way of our profession, is against it."
1243,"We are to cure such sorrows, not to sow ’em."
1244,"For goodness’ sake, consider what you do,"
1245,"How you may hurt yourself, ay, utterly"
1246,"Grow from the King’s acquaintance, by this carriage."
1247,"The hearts of princes kiss obedience,"
1248,"So much they love it, but to stubborn spirits"
1249,They swell and grow as terrible as storms.
1250,"I know you have a gentle, noble temper,"
1251,A soul as even as a calm. Pray think us
1252,"Those we profess: peacemakers, friends, and servants."
1253,"Madam, you’ll find it so. You wrong your virtues"
1254,"With these weak women’s fears. A noble spirit,"
1255,"As yours was put into you, ever casts"
1256,"Such doubts, as false coin, from it. The King loves you;"
1257,"Beware you lose it not. For us, if you please"
1258,"To trust us in your business, we are ready"
1259,To use our utmost studies in your service.
1260,"Do what ye will, my lords, and pray forgive me"
1261,If I have used myself unmannerly.
1262,"You know I am a woman, lacking wit"
1263,To make a seemly answer to such persons.
1264,Pray do my service to his Majesty.
1265,"He has my heart yet, and shall have my prayers"
1266,"While I shall have my life. Come, reverend fathers,"
1267,Bestow your counsels on me. She now begs
1268,"That little thought, when she set footing here,"
1269,She should have bought her dignities so dear.
1270,SCENE II. Ante-chamber to the King’s apartment.
1271,"Enter the Duke of Norfolk, Duke of Suffolk, Lord Surrey and Lord"
1272,If you will now unite in your complaints
1273,"And force them with a constancy, the Cardinal"
1274,Cannot stand under them. If you omit
1275,"The offer of this time, I cannot promise"
1276,But that you shall sustain more new disgraces
1277,With these you bear already.
1278,To meet the least occasion that may give me
1279,"Remembrance of my father-in-law the Duke,"
1280,To be revenged on him.
1281,Which of the peers
1282,"Have uncontemned gone by him, or at least"
1283,Strangely neglected? When did he regard
1284,The stamp of nobleness in any person
1285,"My lords, you speak your pleasures."
1286,What he deserves of you and me I know;
1287,What we can do to him—though now the time
1288,Gives way to us—I much fear. If you cannot
1289,"Bar his access to th’ King, never attempt"
1290,"Anything on him, for he hath a witchcraft"
1291,Over the King in ’s tongue.
1292,"O, fear him not."
1293,His spell in that is out. The King hath found
1294,Matter against him that for ever mars
1295,"The honey of his language. No, he’s settled,"
1296,"Not to come off, in his displeasure."
1297,I should be glad to hear such news as this
1298,"Believe it, this is true."
1299,In the divorce his contrary proceedings
1300,"Are all unfolded, wherein he appears"
1301,As I would wish mine enemy.
1302,His practices to light?
1303,"The Cardinal’s letters to the Pope miscarried,"
1304,"And came to th’ eye o’ the King, wherein was read"
1305,How that the Cardinal did entreat his Holiness
1306,To stay the judgement o’ th’ divorce; for if
1307,"It did take place, “I do” quoth he “perceive"
1308,My king is tangled in affection to
1309,"A creature of the Queen’s, Lady Anne Bullen.”"
1310,Has the King this?
1311,The King in this perceives him how he coasts
1312,And hedges his own way. But in this point
1313,"All his tricks founder, and he brings his physic"
1314,After his patient’s death. The King already
1315,Hath married the fair lady.
1316,"May you be happy in your wish, my lord,"
1317,For I profess you have it.
1318,"Now, all my joy"
1319,There’s order given for her coronation.
1320,"Marry, this is yet but young, and may be left"
1321,"To some ears unrecounted. But, my lords,"
1322,"She is a gallant creature, and complete"
1323,"In mind and feature. I persuade me, from her"
1324,Will fall some blessing to this land which shall
1325,In it be memorized.
1326,But will the King
1327,Digest this letter of the Cardinal’s?
1328,There be more wasps that buzz about his nose
1329,Will make this sting the sooner. Cardinal Campeius
1330,Is stolen away to Rome; hath ta’en no leave;
1331,"Has left the cause o’ th’ King unhandled, and"
1332,"Is posted, as the agent of our Cardinal,"
1333,To second all his plot. I do assure you
1334,The King cried “Ha!” at this.
1335,"Now, God incense him,"
1336,And let him cry “Ha!” louder.
1337,"He is returned in his opinions, which"
1338,"Have satisfied the King for his divorce,"
1339,Together with all famous colleges
1340,"Almost in Christendom. Shortly, I believe,"
1341,"His second marriage shall be published, and"
1342,Her coronation. Katherine no more
1343,"Shall be called Queen, but Princess Dowager"
1344,And widow to Prince Arthur.
1345,"A worthy fellow, and hath ta’en much pain"
1346,In the King’s business.
1347,"He has, and we shall see him"
1348,For it an archbishop.
1349,Enter Wolsey and Cromwell.
1350,"Observe, observe; he’s moody."
1351,Gave’t you the King?
1352,"To his own hand, in ’s bedchamber."
1353,Looked he o’ th’ inside of the paper?
1354,"He did unseal them, and the first he viewed,"
1355,He did it with a serious mind; a heed
1356,Was in his countenance. You he bade
1357,Attend him here this morning.
1358,I think by this he is.
1359,Leave me a while.
1360,The French king’s sister; he shall marry her.
1361,Anne Bullen? No; I’ll no Anne Bullens for him.
1362,There’s more in’t than fair visage. Bullen?
1363,"No, we’ll no Bullens. Speedily I wish"
1364,To hear from Rome. The Marchioness of Pembroke!
1365,Maybe he hears the King
1366,Does whet his anger to him.
1367,"Lord, for thy justice!"
1368,To be her mistress’ mistress? The Queen’s Queen?
1369,This candle burns not clear. ’Tis I must snuff it;
1370,Then out it goes. What though I know her virtuous
1371,And well deserving? Yet I know her for
1372,"A spleeny Lutheran, and not wholesome to"
1373,"Our cause, that she should lie i’ th’ bosom of"
1374,"Our hard-ruled King. Again, there is sprung up"
1375,"An heretic, an arch-one, Cranmer, one"
1376,Hath crawled into the favour of the King
1377,And is his oracle.
1378,He is vexed at something.
1379,"Enter King, reading a schedule, and Lovell."
1380,"I would ’twere something that would fret the string,"
1381,The master-cord on ’s heart.
1382,"The King, the King!"
1383,What piles of wealth hath he accumulated
1384,To his own portion! And what expense by th’ hour
1385,"Seems to flow from him! How, i’ th’ name of thrift"
1386,"Does he rake this together? Now, my lords,"
1387,Saw you the Cardinal?
1388,"My lord, we have"
1389,Stood here observing him. Some strange commotion
1390,"Is in his brain. He bites his lip, and starts,"
1391,"Stops on a sudden, looks upon the ground,"
1392,Then lays his finger on his temple; straight
1393,"Springs out into fast gait; then stops again,"
1394,"Strikes his breast hard, and anon he casts"
1395,His eye against the moon. In most strange postures
1396,We have seen him set himself.
1397,It may well be
1398,There is a mutiny in ’s mind. This morning
1399,"Papers of state he sent me to peruse,"
1400,As I required; and wot you what I found
1401,"There—on my conscience, put unwittingly?"
1402,"Forsooth, an inventory, thus importing"
1403,"The several parcels of his plate, his treasure,"
1404,"Rich stuffs and ornaments of household, which"
1405,I find at such proud rate that it outspeaks
1406,Possession of a subject.
1407,Some spirit put this paper in the packet
1408,To bless your eye withal.
1409,If we did think
1410,His contemplation were above the earth
1411,"And fixed on spiritual object, he should still"
1412,"Dwell in his musings, but I am afraid"
1413,"His thinkings are below the moon, not worth"
1414,Ever God bless your Highness.
1415,"You are full of heavenly stuff, and bear the inventory"
1416,"Of your best graces in your mind, the which"
1417,You were now running o’er. You have scarce time
1418,To steal from spiritual leisure a brief span
1419,"To keep your earthly audit. Sure, in that"
1420,"I deem you an ill husband, and am glad"
1421,To have you therein my companion.
1422,For holy offices I have a time; a time
1423,To think upon the part of business which
1424,I bear i’ th’ state; and Nature does require
1425,"Her times of preservation, which perforce"
1426,"I, her frail son, amongst my brethren mortal,"
1427,Must give my tendance to.
1428,You have said well.
1429,"And ever may your Highness yoke together,"
1430,"As I will lend you cause, my doing well"
1431,With my well saying.
1432,"’Tis well said again,"
1433,And ’tis a kind of good deed to say well.
1434,And yet words are no deeds. My father loved you;
1435,"He said he did, and with his deed did crown"
1436,"His word upon you. Since I had my office,"
1437,"I have kept you next my heart, have not alone"
1438,"Employed you where high profits might come home,"
1439,But pared my present havings to bestow
1440,My bounties upon you.
1441,Have I not made you
1442,"The prime man of the state? I pray you tell me,"
1443,"If what I now pronounce you have found true,"
1444,"And, if you may confess it, say withal"
1445,If you are bound to us or no. What say you?
1446,"My sovereign, I confess your royal graces,"
1447,"Showered on me daily, have been more than could"
1448,"My studied purposes requite, which went"
1449,Beyond all man’s endeavours. My endeavours
1450,"Have ever come too short of my desires,"
1451,Yet filed with my abilities. Mine own ends
1452,Have been mine so that evermore they pointed
1453,To th’ good of your most sacred person and
1454,The profit of the state. For your great graces
1455,"Heaped upon me, poor undeserver, I"
1456,"Can nothing render but allegiant thanks,"
1457,"My prayers to heaven for you, my loyalty,"
1458,"Which ever has and ever shall be growing,"
1459,"Till death, that winter, kill it."
1460,A loyal and obedient subject is
1461,Therein illustrated. The honour of it
1462,"Does pay the act of it, as i’ th’ contrary,"
1463,The foulness is the punishment. I presume
1464,"That, as my hand has opened bounty to you,"
1465,"My heart dropped love, my power rained honour, more"
1466,"On you than any, so your hand and heart,"
1467,"Your brain, and every function of your power,"
1468,"Should, notwithstanding that your bond of duty,"
1469,"As ’twere in love’s particular, be more"
1470,"To me, your friend, than any."
1471,That for your Highness’ good I ever laboured
1472,"More than mine own, that am, have, and will be."
1473,Though all the world should crack their duty to you
1474,"And throw it from their soul, though perils did"
1475,"Abound as thick as thought could make ’em, and"
1476,"Appear in forms more horrid—yet my duty,"
1477,"As doth a rock against the chiding flood,"
1478,"Should the approach of this wild river break,"
1479,And stand unshaken yours.
1480,"Take notice, lords: he has a loyal breast,"
1481,For you have seen him open’t.
1482,"And after, this; and then to breakfast with"
1483,What appetite you have.
1484,"[_Exit King, frowning upon the Cardinal; the nobles throng after him,"
1485,What should this mean?
1486,What sudden anger’s this? How have I reaped it?
1487,"He parted frowning from me, as if ruin"
1488,Leaped from his eyes. So looks the chafed lion
1489,"Upon the daring huntsman that has galled him,"
1490,Then makes him nothing. I must read this paper—
1491,"I fear, the story of his anger. ’Tis so."
1492,This paper has undone me. ’Tis th’ account
1493,Of all that world of wealth I have drawn together
1494,"For mine own ends—indeed, to gain the popedom"
1495,"And fee my friends in Rome. O negligence,"
1496,Fit for a fool to fall by! What cross devil
1497,Made me put this main secret in the packet
1498,I sent the King? Is there no way to cure this?
1499,No new device to beat this from his brains?
1500,I know ’twill stir him strongly; yet I know
1501,"A way, if it take right, in spite of fortune,"
1502,Will bring me off again. What’s this? “To th’ Pope”?
1503,"The letter, as I live, with all the business"
1504,"I writ to ’s Holiness. Nay then, farewell!"
1505,"I have touched the highest point of all my greatness,"
1506,And from that full meridian of my glory
1507,I haste now to my setting. I shall fall
1508,"Like a bright exhalation in the evening,"
1509,And no man see me more.
1510,"Enter to Wolsey, the Dukes of Norfolk and Suffolk, the Earl of Surrey,"
1511,and the Lord Chamberlain.
1512,"Hear the King’s pleasure, Cardinal, who commands you"
1513,To render up the great seal presently
1514,"Into our hands, and to confine yourself"
1515,"To Asher House, my Lord of Winchester’s,"
1516,Till you hear further from his Highness.
1517,"Where’s your commission, lords? Words cannot carry"
1518,"Who dares cross ’em,"
1519,Bearing the King’s will from his mouth expressly?
1520,Till I find more than will or words to do it—
1521,"I mean your malice—know, officious lords,"
1522,I dare and must deny it. Now I feel
1523,"Of what coarse metal ye are moulded, envy!"
1524,"How eagerly ye follow my disgraces,"
1525,"As if it fed ye, and how sleek and wanton"
1526,Ye appear in everything may bring my ruin!
1527,"Follow your envious courses, men of malice;"
1528,"You have Christian warrant for ’em, and no doubt"
1529,In time will find their fit rewards. That seal
1530,"You ask with such a violence, the King,"
1531,"Mine and your master, with his own hand gave me;"
1532,"Bade me enjoy it, with the place and honours,"
1533,"During my life; and, to confirm his goodness,"
1534,"Tied it by letters-patents. Now, who’ll take it?"
1535,The King that gave it.
1536,"It must be himself, then."
1537,"Thou art a proud traitor, priest."
1538,"Proud lord, thou liest."
1539,Within these forty hours Surrey durst better
1540,Have burnt that tongue than said so.
1541,"Thou scarlet sin, robbed this bewailing land"
1542,"Of noble Buckingham, my father-in-law."
1543,"The heads of all thy brother cardinals,"
1544,"With thee and all thy best parts bound together,"
1545,Weighed not a hair of his. Plague of your policy!
1546,"You sent me Deputy for Ireland,"
1547,"Far from his succour, from the King, from all"
1548,"That might have mercy on the fault thou gav’st him,"
1549,"Whilst your great goodness, out of holy pity,"
1550,Absolved him with an axe.
1551,"This, and all else"
1552,"This talking lord can lay upon my credit,"
1553,I answer is most false. The Duke by law
1554,Found his deserts. How innocent I was
1555,"From any private malice in his end,"
1556,His noble jury and foul cause can witness.
1557,"If I loved many words, lord, I should tell you"
1558,"You have as little honesty as honour,"
1559,That in the way of loyalty and truth
1560,"Toward the King, my ever royal master,"
1561,"Dare mate a sounder man than Surrey can be,"
1562,And all that love his follies.
1563,"Your long coat, priest, protects you; thou shouldst feel"
1564,"My sword i’ th’ lifeblood of thee else. My lords,"
1565,Can ye endure to hear this arrogance?
1566,"And from this fellow? If we live thus tamely,"
1567,"To be thus jaded by a piece of scarlet,"
1568,"Farewell, nobility. Let his Grace go forward"
1569,"And dare us with his cap, like larks."
1570,Is poison to thy stomach.
1571,"Of gleaning all the land’s wealth into one,"
1572,"Into your own hands, Cardinal, by extortion;"
1573,The goodness of your intercepted packets
1574,"You writ to the Pope against the King. Your goodness,"
1575,"Since you provoke me, shall be most notorious."
1576,"My Lord of Norfolk, as you are truly noble,"
1577,"As you respect the common good, the state"
1578,"Of our despised nobility, our issues,"
1579,"Who, if he live, will scarce be gentlemen,"
1580,"Produce the grand sum of his sins, the articles"
1581,Collected from his life. I’ll startle you
1582,Worse than the sacring bell when the brown wench
1583,"Lay kissing in your arms, Lord Cardinal."
1584,"How much, methinks, I could despise this man,"
1585,But that I am bound in charity against it!
1586,"Those articles, my lord, are in the King’s hand;"
1587,"But thus much, they are foul ones."
1588,And spotless shall mine innocence arise
1589,When the King knows my truth.
1590,This cannot save you.
1591,I thank my memory I yet remember
1592,"Some of these articles, and out they shall."
1593,"Now, if you can blush and cry “Guilty,” Cardinal,"
1594,You’ll show a little honesty.
1595,"I dare your worst objections. If I blush,"
1596,It is to see a nobleman want manners.
1597,I had rather want those than my head. Have at you!
1598,"First, that without the King’s assent or knowledge,"
1599,"You wrought to be a legate, by which power"
1600,You maimed the jurisdiction of all bishops.
1601,"Then, that in all you writ to Rome, or else"
1602,"To foreign princes, “_ego et rex meus_”"
1603,"Was still inscribed, in which you brought the King"
1604,To be your servant.
1605,"Then, that without the knowledge"
1606,"Either of King or Council, when you went"
1607,"Ambassador to the Emperor, you made bold"
1608,To carry into Flanders the great seal.
1609,"Item, you sent a large commission"
1610,"To Gregory de Cassado, to conclude,"
1611,"Without the King’s will or the state’s allowance,"
1612,A league between his Highness and Ferrara.
1613,That out of mere ambition you have caused
1614,Your holy hat to be stamped on the King’s coin.
1615,"Then, that you have sent innumerable substance—"
1616,"By what means got, I leave to your own conscience—"
1617,To furnish Rome and to prepare the ways
1618,"You have for dignities, to the mere undoing"
1619,"Of all the kingdom. Many more there are,"
1620,"Which, since they are of you, and odious,"
1621,I will not taint my mouth with.
1622,Press not a falling man too far! ’Tis virtue.
1623,"His faults lie open to the laws; let them,"
1624,"Not you, correct him. My heart weeps to see him"
1625,So little of his great self.
1626,"Lord Cardinal, the King’s further pleasure is,"
1627,Because all those things you have done of late
1628,By your power legative within this kingdom
1629,"Fall into th’ compass of a _praemunire_,"
1630,That therefore such a writ be sued against you
1631,"To forfeit all your goods, lands, tenements,"
1632,"Chattels, and whatsoever, and to be"
1633,Out of the King’s protection. This is my charge.
1634,And so we’ll leave you to your meditations
1635,How to live better. For your stubborn answer
1636,"About the giving back the great seal to us,"
1637,"The King shall know it and, no doubt, shall thank you."
1638,"So fare you well, my little good Lord Cardinal."
1639,So farewell to the little good you bear me.
1640,Farewell? A long farewell to all my greatness!
1641,This is the state of man: today he puts forth
1642,"The tender leaves of hopes; tomorrow blossoms,"
1643,And bears his blushing honours thick upon him;
1644,"The third day comes a frost, a killing frost,"
1645,"And when he thinks, good easy man, full surely"
1646,"His greatness is a-ripening, nips his root,"
1647,"And then he falls, as I do. I have ventured,"
1648,"Like little wanton boys that swim on bladders,"
1649,"This many summers in a sea of glory,"
1650,But far beyond my depth. My high-blown pride
1651,"At length broke under me and now has left me,"
1652,"Weary and old with service, to the mercy"
1653,Of a rude stream that must for ever hide me.
1654,"Vain pomp and glory of this world, I hate ye!"
1655,"I feel my heart new opened. O, how wretched"
1656,Is that poor man that hangs on princes’ favours!
1657,"There is betwixt that smile we would aspire to,"
1658,"That sweet aspect of princes, and their ruin,"
1659,More pangs and fears than wars or women have;
1660,"And when he falls, he falls like Lucifer,"
1661,Never to hope again.
1662,"Enter Cromwell, standing amazed."
1663,"Why, how now, Cromwell?"
1664,"I have no power to speak, sir."
1665,At my misfortunes? Can thy spirit wonder
1666,"A great man should decline? Nay, an you weep,"
1667,I am fallen indeed.
1668,How does your Grace?
1669,"Never so truly happy, my good Cromwell."
1670,"I know myself now, and I feel within me"
1671,"A peace above all earthly dignities,"
1672,"A still and quiet conscience. The King has cured me,"
1673,"I humbly thank his Grace, and from these shoulders,"
1674,"These ruined pillars, out of pity, taken"
1675,A load would sink a navy: too much honour.
1676,"O, ’tis a burden, Cromwell, ’tis a burden"
1677,Too heavy for a man that hopes for heaven.
1678,I am glad your Grace has made that right use of it.
1679,"I hope I have. I am able now, methinks,"
1680,"Out of a fortitude of soul I feel,"
1681,To endure more miseries and greater far
1682,Than my weak-hearted enemies dare offer.
1683,The heaviest and the worst
1684,Is your displeasure with the King.
1685,The next is that Sir Thomas More is chosen
1686,Lord Chancellor in your place.
1687,But he’s a learned man. May he continue
1688,"Long in his Highness’ favour, and do justice"
1689,"For truth’s sake and his conscience, that his bones,"
1690,"When he has run his course and sleeps in blessings,"
1691,May have a tomb of orphans’ tears wept on him.
1692,"That Cranmer is returned with welcome,"
1693,Installed Lord Archbishop of Canterbury.
1694,"Last, that the Lady Anne,"
1695,"Whom the King hath in secrecy long married,"
1696,"This day was viewed in open as his Queen,"
1697,"Going to chapel, and the voice is now"
1698,Only about her coronation.
1699,There was the weight that pulled me down.
1700,The King has gone beyond me. All my glories
1701,In that one woman I have lost for ever.
1702,"No sun shall ever usher forth mine honours,"
1703,Or gild again the noble troops that waited
1704,"Upon my smiles. Go, get thee from me, Cromwell."
1705,"I am a poor fallen man, unworthy now"
1706,To be thy lord and master. Seek the King;
1707,"That sun, I pray, may never set! I have told him"
1708,What and how true thou art. He will advance thee;
1709,Some little memory of me will stir him—
1710,I know his noble nature—not to let
1711,"Thy hopeful service perish too. Good Cromwell,"
1712,"Neglect him not; make use now, and provide"
1713,For thine own future safety.
1714,Must I then leave you? Must I needs forgo
1715,"So good, so noble, and so true a master?"
1716,"Bear witness, all that have not hearts of iron,"
1717,With what a sorrow Cromwell leaves his lord.
1718,"The King shall have my service, but my prayers"
1719,For ever and for ever shall be yours.
1720,"Cromwell, I did not think to shed a tear"
1721,"In all my miseries, but thou hast forced me,"
1722,"Out of thy honest truth, to play the woman."
1723,"Let’s dry our eyes, and thus far hear me, Cromwell,"
1724,"And when I am forgotten, as I shall be,"
1725,"And sleep in dull cold marble, where no mention"
1726,"Of me more must be heard of, say, I taught thee;"
1727,"Say Wolsey, that once trod the ways of glory"
1728,"And sounded all the depths and shoals of honour,"
1729,"Found thee a way, out of his wreck, to rise in,"
1730,"A sure and safe one, though thy master missed it."
1731,Mark but my fall and that that ruined me.
1732,"Cromwell, I charge thee, fling away ambition!"
1733,"By that sin fell the angels; how can man, then,"
1734,"The image of his maker, hope to win by it?"
1735,Love thyself last; cherish those hearts that hate thee.
1736,Corruption wins not more than honesty.
1737,Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace
1738,"To silence envious tongues. Be just, and fear not."
1739,"Let all the ends thou aim’st at be thy country’s,"
1740,"Thy God’s, and truth’s. Then if thou fall’st, O Cromwell,"
1741,Thou fall’st a blessed martyr!
1742,"Serve the King. And, prithee, lead me in."
1743,There take an inventory of all I have.
1744,To the last penny; ’tis the King’s. My robe
1745,And my integrity to heaven is all
1746,"I dare now call mine own. O Cromwell, Cromwell,"
1747,Had I but served my God with half the zeal
1748,"I served my king, He would not in mine age"
1749,Have left me naked to mine enemies.
1750,"Good sir, have patience."
1751,"So I have. Farewell,"
1752,The hopes of court! My hopes in heaven do dwell.
1753,SCENE I. A street in Westminster.
1754,"Enter two Gentlemen, meeting one another."
1755,You’re well met once again.
1756,You come to take your stand here and behold
1757,The Lady Anne pass from her coronation?
1758,"’Tis all my business. At our last encounter,"
1759,The Duke of Buckingham came from his trial.
1760,"’Tis very true. But that time offered sorrow,"
1761,"’Tis well. The citizens,"
1762,"I am sure, have shown at full their royal minds,"
1763,"As, let ’em have their rights, they are ever forward"
1764,"In celebration of this day with shows,"
1765,"Pageants, and sights of honour."
1766,"Nor, I’ll assure you, better taken, sir."
1767,"May I be bold to ask what that contains,"
1768,That paper in your hand?
1769,"Yes, ’tis the list"
1770,Of those that claim their offices this day
1771,By custom of the coronation.
1772,"The Duke of Suffolk is the first, and claims"
1773,"To be High Steward; next, the Duke of Norfolk,"
1774,He to be Earl Marshal. You may read the rest.
1775,"I thank you, sir. Had I not known those customs,"
1776,I should have been beholding to your paper.
1777,"But I beseech you, what’s become of Katherine,"
1778,The Princess Dowager? How goes her business?
1779,That I can tell you too. The Archbishop
1780,"Of Canterbury, accompanied with other"
1781,"Learned and reverend fathers of his order,"
1782,"Held a late court at Dunstable, six miles off"
1783,From Ampthill where the Princess lay; to which
1784,"She was often cited by them, but appeared not;"
1785,"And, to be short, for not appearance and"
1786,"The King’s late scruple, by the main assent"
1787,"Of all these learned men she was divorced,"
1788,And the late marriage made of none effect;
1789,"Since which she was removed to Kimbolton,"
1790,Where she remains now sick.
1791,The trumpets sound. Stand close. The Queen is coming.
1792,_The order of the coronation_.
1793,_. A lively flourish of trumpets.
1794,". Then, two Judges."
1795,". Lord Chancellor, with purse and mace before him."
1796,". Choristers, singing. Music."
1797,". Mayor of London, bearing the mace. Then Garter, in his coat of arms,"
1798,and on his head he wore a gilt copper crown.
1799,". Marquess Dorset, bearing a sceptre of gold, on his head a"
1800,"demi-coronal of gold. With him, the Earl of Surrey, bearing the rod of"
1801,"silver with the dove, crowned with an earl’s coronet. Collars of S’s."
1802,". Duke of Suffolk, in his robe of estate, his coronet on his head,"
1803,"bearing a long white wand, as High Steward. With him, the Duke of"
1804,"Norfolk, with the rod of marshalship, a coronet on his head. Collars of"
1805,". A canopy, borne by four of the Cinque Ports; under it, the Queen in"
1806,"her robe, in her hair, richly adorned with pearl, crowned. On each side"
1807,"her, the Bishops of London and Winchester."
1808,". The old Duchess of Norfolk, in a coronal of gold wrought with"
1809,"flowers, bearing the Queen’s train."
1810,". Certain Ladies or Countesses, with plain circlets of gold without"
1811,"[_Exeunt, first passing over the stage in order and state, and then a"
1812,great flourish of trumpets._]
1813,"A royal train, believe me. These I know."
1814,Who’s that that bears the sceptre?
1815,And that the Earl of Surrey with the rod.
1816,A bold brave gentleman. That should be
1817,The Duke of Suffolk.
1818,’Tis the same: High Steward.
1819,And that my Lord of Norfolk?
1820,Thou hast the sweetest face I ever looked on.
1821,"Sir, as I have a soul, she is an angel."
1822,"Our King has all the Indies in his arms,"
1823,"And more, and richer, when he strains that lady."
1824,I cannot blame his conscience.
1825,The cloth of honour over her are four barons
1826,Of the Cinque Ports.
1827,"Those men are happy, and so are all are near her."
1828,I take it she that carries up the train
1829,"Is that old noble lady, Duchess of Norfolk."
1830,"It is, and all the rest are countesses."
1831,Their coronets say so. These are stars indeed.
1832,And sometimes falling ones.
1833,No more of that.
1834,Enter a third Gentleman.
1835,"God save you, sir. Where have you been broiling?"
1836,"Among the crowds i’ th’ Abbey, where a finger"
1837,Could not be wedged in more. I am stifled
1838,With the mere rankness of their joy.
1839,Well worth the seeing.
1840,"Good sir, speak it to us."
1841,As well as I am able. The rich stream
1842,"Of lords and ladies, having brought the Queen"
1843,"To a prepared place in the choir, fell off"
1844,"A distance from her, while her Grace sat down"
1845,"To rest a while, some half an hour or so,"
1846,"In a rich chair of state, opposing freely"
1847,The beauty of her person to the people.
1848,"Believe me, sir, she is the goodliest woman"
1849,"That ever lay by man, which when the people"
1850,"Had the full view of, such a noise arose"
1851,"As the shrouds make at sea in a stiff tempest,"
1852,"As loud and to as many tunes. Hats, cloaks,"
1853,"Doublets, I think, flew up, and had their faces"
1854,"Been loose, this day they had been lost. Such joy"
1855,I never saw before. Great-bellied women
1856,"That had not half a week to go, like rams"
1857,"In the old time of war, would shake the press"
1858,And make ’em reel before ’em. No man living
1859,"Could say “This is my wife” there, all were woven"
1860,So strangely in one piece.
1861,"At length her Grace rose, and with modest paces"
1862,"Came to the altar, where she kneeled and saintlike"
1863,Cast her fair eyes to heaven and prayed devoutly;
1864,"Then rose again and bowed her to the people,"
1865,When by the Archbishop of Canterbury
1866,"She had all the royal makings of a queen,"
1867,"As holy oil, Edward Confessor’s crown,"
1868,"The rod, and bird of peace, and all such emblems"
1869,"Laid nobly on her; which performed, the choir,"
1870,"With all the choicest music of the kingdom,"
1871,"Together sung _Te Deum_. So she parted,"
1872,And with the same full state paced back again
1873,"To York Place, where the feast is held."
1874,"You must no more call it “York Place”, that’s past;"
1875,"For since the Cardinal fell, that title’s lost."
1876,"’Tis now the King’s, and called “Whitehall”."
1877,But ’tis so lately altered that the old name
1878,Is fresh about me.
1879,What two reverend bishops
1880,Were those that went on each side of the Queen?
1881,"Stokesley and Gardiner, the one of Winchester,"
1882,Newly preferred from the King’s secretary;
1883,"Is held no great good lover of the Archbishop’s,"
1884,All the land knows that.
1885,"However, yet there is no great breach. When it comes,"
1886,Cranmer will find a friend will not shrink from him.
1887,"Who may that be, I pray you?"
1888,"A man in much esteem with th’ King, and truly"
1889,A worthy friend. The King has made him
1890,"Master o’ th’ Jewel House,"
1891,And one already of the Privy Council.
1892,He will deserve more.
1893,"Yes, without all doubt."
1894,"Come, gentlemen, ye shall go my way,"
1895,"Which is to th’ court, and there ye shall be my guests,"
1896,"Something I can command. As I walk thither,"
1897,I’ll tell ye more.
1898,"You may command us, sir."
1899,"Enter Katherine Dowager, sick, led between Griffith, her gentleman"
1900,"usher, and Patience, her woman."
1901,How does your Grace?
1902,"O Griffith, sick to death."
1903,"My legs like loaden branches bow to th’ earth,"
1904,Willing to leave their burden. Reach a chair.
1905,"So. Now, methinks, I feel a little ease."
1906,"Didst thou not tell me, Griffith, as thou ledst me,"
1907,"That the great child of honour, Cardinal Wolsey,"
1908,"Yes, madam, but I think your Grace,"
1909,"Out of the pain you suffered, gave no ear to’t."
1910,"Prithee, good Griffith, tell me how he died."
1911,"If well, he stepped before me happily"
1912,"Well, the voice goes, madam."
1913,For after the stout Earl Northumberland
1914,"Arrested him at York and brought him forward,"
1915,"As a man sorely tainted, to his answer,"
1916,He fell sick suddenly and grew so ill
1917,He could not sit his mule.
1918,"At last, with easy roads, he came to Leicester,"
1919,"Lodged in the abbey, where the reverend abbot,"
1920,"With all his covent, honourably received him;"
1921,"To whom he gave these words: “O father abbot,"
1922,"An old man, broken with the storms of state,"
1923,Is come to lay his weary bones among ye.
1924,Give him a little earth for charity.”
1925,"So went to bed, where eagerly his sickness"
1926,"Pursued him still; and three nights after this,"
1927,"About the hour of eight, which he himself"
1928,"Foretold should be his last, full of repentance,"
1929,"Continual meditations, tears, and sorrows,"
1930,"He gave his honours to the world again,"
1931,"His blessed part to heaven, and slept in peace."
1932,So may he rest. His faults lie gently on him!
1933,"Yet thus far, Griffith, give me leave to speak him,"
1934,And yet with charity. He was a man
1935,"Of an unbounded stomach, ever ranking"
1936,Himself with princes; one that by suggestion
1937,Tied all the kingdom. Simony was fair-play.
1938,His own opinion was his law. I’ th’ presence
1939,"He would say untruths, and be ever double"
1940,"Both in his words and meaning. He was never,"
1941,"But where he meant to ruin, pitiful."
1942,"His promises were, as he then was, mighty;"
1943,"But his performance, as he is now, nothing."
1944,"Of his own body he was ill, and gave"
1945,The clergy ill example.
1946,Men’s evil manners live in brass; their virtues
1947,We write in water. May it please your Highness
1948,To hear me speak his good now?
1949,I were malicious else.
1950,"Though from an humble stock, undoubtedly"
1951,Was fashioned to much honour. From his cradle
1952,"He was a scholar, and a ripe and good one,"
1953,"Exceeding wise, fair-spoken, and persuading;"
1954,"Lofty and sour to them that loved him not,"
1955,"But to those men that sought him, sweet as summer."
1956,"And though he were unsatisfied in getting,"
1957,"Which was a sin, yet in bestowing, madam,"
1958,He was most princely. Ever witness for him
1959,"Those twins of learning that he raised in you,"
1960,"Ipswich and Oxford, one of which fell with him,"
1961,Unwilling to outlive the good that did it;
1962,"The other, though unfinished, yet so famous,"
1963,"So excellent in art, and still so rising,"
1964,That Christendom shall ever speak his virtue.
1965,"His overthrow heaped happiness upon him,"
1966,"For then, and not till then, he felt himself,"
1967,And found the blessedness of being little.
1968,"And, to add greater honours to his age"
1969,"Than man could give him, he died fearing God."
1970,"After my death I wish no other herald,"
1971,"No other speaker of my living actions,"
1972,To keep mine honour from corruption
1973,But such an honest chronicler as Griffith.
1974,"Whom I most hated living, thou hast made me,"
1975,"With thy religious truth and modesty,"
1976,Now in his ashes honour. Peace be with him!
1977,"Patience, be near me still, and set me lower:"
1978,"I have not long to trouble thee. Good Griffith,"
1979,Cause the musicians play me that sad note
1980,"I named my knell, whilst I sit meditating"
1981,On that celestial harmony I go to.
1982,"She is asleep. Good wench, let’s sit down quiet,"
1983,"For fear we wake her. Softly, gentle Patience."
1984,"Enter, solemnly tripping one after another, six Personages, clad in"
1985,"white robes, wearing on their heads garlands of bays, and golden"
1986,"vizards on their faces, branches of bays or palm in their hands. They"
1987,"first congee unto her, then dance; and, at certain changes, the first"
1988,"two hold a spare garland over her head, at which the other four make"
1989,reverent curtsies. Then the two that held the garland deliver the same
1990,"to the other next two, who observe the same order in their changes and"
1991,"holding the garland over her head; which done, they deliver the same"
1992,"garland to the last two, who likewise observe the same order. At which,"
1993,"as it were by inspiration, she makes in her sleep signs of rejoicing"
1994,"and holdeth up her hands to heaven. And so in their dancing, vanish,"
1995,carrying the garland with them. The music continues.
1996,"Spirits of peace, where are ye? Are ye all gone,"
1997,And leave me here in wretchedness behind ye?
1998,"Madam, we are here."
1999,It is not you I call for.
2000,Saw ye none enter since I slept?
2001,"No? Saw you not, even now, a blessed troop"
2002,"Invite me to a banquet, whose bright faces"
2003,"Cast thousand beams upon me, like the sun?"
2004,They promised me eternal happiness
2005,"And brought me garlands, Griffith, which I feel"
2006,"I am not worthy yet to wear. I shall, assuredly."
2007,"I am most joyful, madam, such good dreams"
2008,"Bid the music leave,"
2009,They are harsh and heavy to me.
2010,How much her Grace is altered on the sudden?
2011,"How long her face is drawn? How pale she looks,"
2012,And of an earthly cold? Mark her eyes.
2013,"She is going, wench. Pray, pray."
2014,An’t like your Grace—
2015,You are a saucy fellow.
2016,Deserve we no more reverence?
2017,"You are to blame,"
2018,"Knowing she will not lose her wonted greatness,"
2019,"To use so rude behaviour. Go to, kneel."
2020,I humbly do entreat your Highness’ pardon.
2021,My haste made me unmannerly. There is staying
2022,A gentleman sent from the King to see you.
2023,"Admit him entrance, Griffith. But this fellow"
2024,Let me ne’er see again.
2025,"If my sight fail not,"
2026,"You should be lord ambassador from the Emperor,"
2027,"My royal nephew, and your name Caputius."
2028,"Madam, the same. Your servant."
2029,The times and titles now are altered strangely
2030,"With me since first you knew me. But I pray you,"
2031,What is your pleasure with me?
2032,"First, mine own service to your Grace; the next,"
2033,"The King’s request that I would visit you,"
2034,"Who grieves much for your weakness, and by me"
2035,"Sends you his princely commendations,"
2036,And heartily entreats you take good comfort.
2037,"O my good lord, that comfort comes too late;"
2038,’Tis like a pardon after execution.
2039,"That gentle physic given in time had cured me,"
2040,But now I am past all comforts here but prayers.
2041,How does his Highness?
2042,"Madam, in good health."
2043,"So may he ever do, and ever flourish,"
2044,"When I shall dwell with worms, and my poor name"
2045,"Banished the kingdom. Patience, is that letter"
2046,I caused you write yet sent away?
2047,"Sir, I most humbly pray you to deliver"
2048,This to my lord the King.
2049,In which I have commended to his goodness
2050,"The model of our chaste loves, his young daughter—"
2051,The dews of heaven fall thick in blessings on her!—
2052,Beseeching him to give her virtuous breeding—
2053,She is young and of a noble modest nature;
2054,I hope she will deserve well—and a little
2055,"To love her for her mother’s sake that loved him,"
2056,Heaven knows how dearly. My next poor petition
2057,Is that his noble Grace would have some pity
2058,"Upon my wretched women, that so long"
2059,Have followed both my fortunes faithfully;
2060,"Of which there is not one, I dare avow—"
2061,"And now I should not lie—but will deserve,"
2062,"For virtue and true beauty of the soul,"
2063,"For honesty and decent carriage,"
2064,A right good husband. Let him be a noble;
2065,And sure those men are happy that shall have ’em.
2066,"The last is for my men—they are the poorest,"
2067,But poverty could never draw ’em from me—
2068,"That they may have their wages duly paid ’em,"
2069,And something over to remember me by.
2070,If heaven had pleased to have given me longer life
2071,"And able means, we had not parted thus."
2072,"These are the whole contents, and, good my lord,"
2073,"By that you love the dearest in this world,"
2074,"As you wish Christian peace to souls departed,"
2075,"Stand these poor people’s friend, and urge the King"
2076,To do me this last right.
2077,"By heaven, I will,"
2078,Or let me lose the fashion of a man!
2079,"I thank you, honest lord. Remember me"
2080,In all humility unto his Highness.
2081,Say his long trouble now is passing
2082,"Out of this world. Tell him in death I blessed him,"
2083,"For so I will. Mine eyes grow dim. Farewell,"
2084,"My lord. Griffith, farewell. Nay, Patience,"
2085,You must not leave me yet. I must to bed;
2086,"Call in more women. When I am dead, good wench,"
2087,Let me be used with honour. Strew me over
2088,"With maiden flowers, that all the world may know"
2089,"I was a chaste wife to my grave. Embalm me,"
2090,"Then lay me forth. Although unqueened, yet like"
2091,A queen and daughter to a king inter me.
2092,I can no more.
2093,SCENE I. A gallery in the palace.
2094,"Enter Gardiner, Bishop of Winchester, a Page with a torch before him,"
2095,met by Sir Thomas Lovell.
2096,"It’s one o’clock, boy, is’t not?"
2097,"These should be hours for necessities,"
2098,Not for delights; times to repair our nature
2099,"With comforting repose, and not for us"
2100,"To waste these times. Good hour of night, Sir Thomas!"
2101,"Came you from the King, my lord?"
2102,"I did, Sir Thomas, and left him at primero"
2103,With the Duke of Suffolk.
2104,"I must to him too,"
2105,Before he go to bed. I’ll take my leave.
2106,"Not yet, Sir Thomas Lovell. What’s the matter?"
2107,It seems you are in haste. An if there be
2108,"No great offence belongs to’t, give your friend"
2109,"Some touch of your late business. Affairs that walk,"
2110,"As they say spirits do, at midnight have"
2111,In them a wilder nature than the business
2112,That seeks despatch by day.
2113,"My lord, I love you,"
2114,And durst commend a secret to your ear
2115,Much weightier than this work. The Queen’s in labour—
2116,"They say in great extremity, and feared"
2117,She’ll with the labour end.
2118,The fruit she goes with
2119,"I pray for heartily, that it may find"
2120,"Good time, and live; but for the stock, Sir Thomas,"
2121,I wish it grubbed up now.
2122,"Cry the amen, and yet my conscience says"
2123,"She’s a good creature and, sweet lady, does"
2124,Deserve our better wishes.
2125,"Hear me, Sir Thomas. You’re a gentleman"
2126,"Of mine own way. I know you wise, religious;"
2127,"And let me tell you, it will ne’er be well,"
2128,"’Twill not, Sir Thomas Lovell, take’t of me,"
2129,"Till Cranmer, Cromwell, her two hands, and she"
2130,Sleep in their graves.
2131,"Now, sir, you speak of two"
2132,"The most remarked i’ th’ kingdom. As for Cromwell,"
2133,"Beside that of the Jewel House, is made Master"
2134,"O’ th’ Rolls, and the King’s secretary; further, sir,"
2135,"Stands in the gap and trade of more preferments,"
2136,With which the time will load him. Th’ Archbishop
2137,"Is the King’s hand and tongue, and who dare speak"
2138,One syllable against him?
2139,"Yes, yes, Sir Thomas,"
2140,"There are that dare, and I myself have ventured"
2141,"To speak my mind of him. And indeed this day,"
2142,"Sir—I may tell it you, I think—I have"
2143,"Incensed the lords o’ th’ Council, that he is—"
2144,"For so I know he is, they know he is—"
2145,"A most arch heretic, a pestilence"
2146,"That does infect the land; with which they, moved,"
2147,"Have broken with the King, who hath so far"
2148,"Given ear to our complaint, of his great grace"
2149,And princely care foreseeing those fell mischiefs
2150,"Our reasons laid before him, hath commanded"
2151,Tomorrow morning to the Council board
2152,"He be convented. He’s a rank weed, Sir Thomas,"
2153,And we must root him out. From your affairs
2154,"I hinder you too long. Good night, Sir Thomas."
2155,"Many good nights, my lord. I rest your servant."
2156,Enter King and Suffolk.
2157,"Charles, I will play no more tonight."
2158,My mind’s not on’t; you are too hard for me.
2159,"Sir, I did never win of you before."
2160,"Nor shall not, when my fancy’s on my play."
2161,"Now, Lovell, from the Queen what is the news?"
2162,I could not personally deliver to her
2163,"What you commanded me, but by her woman"
2164,"I sent your message, who returned her thanks"
2165,"In the great’st humbleness, and desired your Highness"
2166,Most heartily to pray for her.
2167,"What sayst thou, ha?"
2168,"To pray for her? What, is she crying out?"
2169,"So said her woman, and that her suff’rance made"
2170,Almost each pang a death.
2171,"God safely quit her of her burden, and"
2172,"With gentle travail, to the gladding of"
2173,Your Highness with an heir!
2174,"Prithee, to bed, and in thy prayers remember"
2175,"Th’ estate of my poor Queen. Leave me alone,"
2176,For I must think of that which company
2177,Will not be friendly to.
2178,I wish your Highness
2179,"A quiet night, and my good mistress will"
2180,Remember in my prayers.
2181,Enter Sir Anthony Denny.
2182,"Well, sir, what follows?"
2183,"Sir, I have brought my lord the Archbishop,"
2184,As you commanded me.
2185,"Ay, my good lord."
2186,"’Tis true. Where is he, Denny?"
2187,He attends your Highness’ pleasure.
2188,Bring him to us.
2189,I am happily come hither.
2190,Enter Cranmer and Denny.
2191,Avoid the gallery. [_Lovell seems to stay_.]
2192,Ha! I have said. Be gone.
2193,’Tis his aspect of terror. All’s not well.
2194,"How now, my lord? You do desire to know"
2195,Wherefore I sent for you.
2196,T’ attend your Highness’ pleasure.
2197,My good and gracious Lord of Canterbury.
2198,"Come, you and I must walk a turn together."
2199,"I have news to tell you. Come, come, give me your hand."
2200,"Ah, my good lord, I grieve at what I speak,"
2201,And am right sorry to repeat what follows.
2202,"I have, and most unwillingly, of late"
2203,"Heard many grievous—I do say, my lord,"
2204,"Grievous—complaints of you, which, being considered,"
2205,Have moved us and our Council that you shall
2206,"This morning come before us, where I know,"
2207,You cannot with such freedom purge yourself
2208,"But that, till further trial in those charges"
2209,"Which will require your answer, you must take"
2210,Your patience to you and be well contented
2211,"To make your house our Tower. You a brother of us,"
2212,"It fits we thus proceed, or else no witness"
2213,Would come against you.
2214,And am right glad to catch this good occasion
2215,"Most throughly to be winnowed, where my chaff"
2216,And corn shall fly asunder. For I know
2217,There’s none stands under more calumnious tongues
2218,"Than I myself, poor man."
2219,"Stand up, good Canterbury!"
2220,Thy truth and thy integrity is rooted
2221,"In us, thy friend. Give me thy hand. Stand up."
2222,"Prithee, let’s walk. Now, by my halidom,"
2223,"What manner of man are you? My lord, I looked"
2224,You would have given me your petition that
2225,I should have ta’en some pains to bring together
2226,Yourself and your accusers and to have heard you
2227,The good I stand on is my truth and honesty.
2228,"If they shall fail, I with mine enemies"
2229,"Will triumph o’er my person, which I weigh not,"
2230,Being of those virtues vacant. I fear nothing
2231,What can be said against me.
2232,"How your state stands i’ th’ world, with the whole world?"
2233,"Your enemies are many, and not small; their practices"
2234,"Must bear the same proportion, and not ever"
2235,The justice and the truth o’ th’ question carries
2236,The due o’ th’ verdict with it. At what ease
2237,Might corrupt minds procure knaves as corrupt
2238,To swear against you? Such things have been done.
2239,"You are potently opposed, and with a malice"
2240,"Of as great size. Ween you of better luck,"
2241,"I mean in perjured witness, than your master,"
2242,"Whose minister you are, whiles here he lived"
2243,"Upon this naughty earth? Go to, go to."
2244,"You take a precipice for no leap of danger,"
2245,And woo your own destruction.
2246,God and your Majesty
2247,"Protect mine innocence, or I fall into"
2248,The trap is laid for me.
2249,Be of good cheer.
2250,They shall no more prevail than we give way to.
2251,"Keep comfort to you, and this morning see"
2252,"You do appear before them. If they shall chance,"
2253,"In charging you with matters, to commit you,"
2254,The best persuasions to the contrary
2255,"Fail not to use, and with what vehemency"
2256,Th’ occasion shall instruct you. If entreaties
2257,"Will render you no remedy, this ring"
2258,"Deliver them, and your appeal to us"
2259,"There make before them. Look, the good man weeps!"
2260,"He’s honest, on mine honour. God’s blest mother,"
2261,"I swear he is true-hearted, and a soul"
2262,"None better in my kingdom.—Get you gone,"
2263,And do as I have bid you.
2264,His language in his tears.
2265,Enter Old Lady; Lovell follows.
2266,I’ll not come back. The tidings that I bring
2267,"Will make my boldness manners. Now, good angels"
2268,Fly o’er thy royal head and shade thy person
2269,Under their blessed wings!
2270,Now by thy looks
2271,I guess thy message. Is the Queen delivered?
2272,"Say “Ay, and of a boy”."
2273,"Ay, ay, my liege,"
2274,And of a lovely boy. The God of heaven
2275,Both now and ever bless her! ’Tis a girl
2276,"Promises boys hereafter. Sir, your Queen"
2277,"Desires your visitation, and to be"
2278,Acquainted with this stranger. ’Tis as like you
2279,As cherry is to cherry.
2280,"An hundred marks? By this light, I’ll ha’ more."
2281,An ordinary groom is for such payment.
2282,I will have more or scold it out of him.
2283,Said I for this the girl was like to him?
2284,"I’ll have more, or else unsay’t. And now,"
2285,"While ’tis hot, I’ll put it to the issue."
2286,SCENE II. Lobby before the council-chamber.
2287,"Enter Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury."
2288,"I hope I am not too late, and yet the gentleman"
2289,That was sent to me from the Council prayed me
2290,To make great haste. All fast? What means this? Ho!
2291,Sure you know me?
2292,But yet I cannot help you.
2293,Your Grace must wait till you be called for.
2294,I came this way so happily. The King
2295,Shall understand it presently.
2296,"The King’s physician. As he passed along,"
2297,How earnestly he cast his eyes upon me!
2298,"Pray heaven he sound not my disgrace. For certain,"
2299,This is of purpose laid by some that hate me—
2300,God turn their hearts! I never sought their malice—
2301,To quench mine honour. They would shame to make me
2302,"Wait else at door, a fellow councillor,"
2303,"’Mong boys, grooms, and lackeys. But their pleasures"
2304,"Must be fulfilled, and I attend with patience."
2305,Enter the King and Butts at a window above.
2306,I’ll show your Grace the strangest sight.
2307,I think your Highness saw this many a day.
2308,"Body o’ me, where is it?"
2309,"The high promotion of his Grace of Canterbury,"
2310,"Who holds his state at door, ’mongst pursuivants,"
2311,"Ha! ’Tis he, indeed."
2312,Is this the honour they do one another?
2313,’Tis well there’s one above ’em yet. I had thought
2314,They had parted so much honesty among ’em—
2315,At least good manners—as not thus to suffer
2316,"A man of his place, and so near our favour,"
2317,"To dance attendance on their lordships’ pleasures,"
2318,"And at the door too, like a post with packets."
2319,"By holy Mary, Butts, there’s knavery!"
2320,"Let ’em alone, and draw the curtain close."
2321,We shall hear more anon.
2322,A council table brought in with chairs and stools and placed under the
2323,"state. Enter Lord Chancellor, places himself at the upper end of the"
2324,"table on the left hand, a seat being left void above him, as for"
2325,"Canterbury’s seat. Duke of Suffolk, Duke of Norfolk, Surrey, Lord"
2326,"Chamberlain, Gardiner seat themselves in order on each side; Cromwell"
2327,"at lower end, as secretary."
2328,"Speak to the business, master secretary."
2329,Why are we met in council?
2330,The chief cause concerns his Grace of Canterbury.
2331,Has he had knowledge of it?
2332,"Without, my noble lords?"
2333,"And has done half an hour, to know your pleasures."
2334,Let him come in.
2335,Your Grace may enter now.
2336,Cranmer approaches the council table.
2337,"My good lord Archbishop, I’m very sorry"
2338,To sit here at this present and behold
2339,"That chair stand empty. But we all are men,"
2340,"In our own natures frail, and capable"
2341,Of our flesh—few are angels—out of which frailty
2342,"And want of wisdom, you that best should teach us,"
2343,"Have misdemeaned yourself, and not a little,"
2344,"Toward the King first, then his laws, in filling"
2345,"The whole realm, by your teaching and your chaplains’—"
2346,"For so we are informed—with new opinions,"
2347,"Divers and dangerous, which are heresies"
2348,"And, not reformed, may prove pernicious."
2349,"Which reformation must be sudden too,"
2350,My noble lords; for those that tame wild horses
2351,"Pace ’em not in their hands to make ’em gentle,"
2352,But stop their mouth with stubborn bits and spur ’em
2353,"Till they obey the manage. If we suffer,"
2354,Out of our easiness and childish pity
2355,"To one man’s honour, this contagious sickness,"
2356,"Farewell, all physic. And what follows then?"
2357,"Commotions, uproars, with a general taint"
2358,"Of the whole state, as of late days our neighbours,"
2359,"The upper Germany, can dearly witness,"
2360,Yet freshly pitied in our memories.
2361,"My good lords, hitherto in all the progress"
2362,"Both of my life and office, I have laboured,"
2363,"And with no little study, that my teaching"
2364,And the strong course of my authority
2365,"Might go one way, and safely; and the end"
2366,Was ever to do well. Nor is there living—
2367,"I speak it with a single heart, my lords—"
2368,"A man that more detests, more stirs against,"
2369,"Both in his private conscience and his place,"
2370,Defacers of a public peace than I do.
2371,Pray heaven the King may never find a heart
2372,With less allegiance in it! Men that make
2373,Envy and crooked malice nourishment
2374,Dare bite the best. I do beseech your lordships
2375,"That, in this case of justice, my accusers,"
2376,"Be what they will, may stand forth face to face"
2377,And freely urge against me.
2378,"That cannot be. You are a councillor,"
2379,And by that virtue no man dare accuse you.
2380,"My lord, because we have business of more moment,"
2381,We will be short with you. ’Tis his Highness’ pleasure
2382,"And our consent, for better trial of you,"
2383,"From hence you be committed to the Tower,"
2384,"Where, being but a private man again,"
2385,You shall know many dare accuse you boldly—
2386,"More than, I fear, you are provided for."
2387,"Ah, my good Lord of Winchester, I thank you."
2388,"You are always my good friend. If your will pass,"
2389,"I shall both find your lordship judge and juror,"
2390,You are so merciful. I see your end:
2391,"’Tis my undoing. Love and meekness, lord,"
2392,Become a churchman better than ambition.
2393,Win straying souls with modesty again;
2394,"Cast none away. That I shall clear myself,"
2395,"Lay all the weight ye can upon my patience,"
2396,I make as little doubt as you do conscience
2397,"In doing daily wrongs. I could say more,"
2398,But reverence to your calling makes me modest.
2399,"My lord, my lord, you are a sectary,"
2400,"That’s the plain truth. Your painted gloss discovers,"
2401,"To men that understand you, words and weakness."
2402,"My Lord of Winchester, you are a little,"
2403,"By your good favour, too sharp. Men so noble,"
2404,"However faulty, yet should find respect"
2405,For what they have been. ’Tis a cruelty
2406,To load a falling man.
2407,I cry your honour mercy: you may worst
2408,Of all this table say so.
2409,Do not I know you for a favourer
2410,Of this new sect? Ye are not sound.
2411,"Not sound, I say."
2412,Would you were half so honest!
2413,"Men’s prayers then would seek you, not their fears."
2414,I shall remember this bold language.
2415,Remember your bold life too.
2416,This is too much.
2417,"Forbear, for shame, my lords."
2418,"Then thus for you, my lord: it stands agreed,"
2419,"I take it, by all voices, that forthwith"
2420,"You be conveyed to th’ Tower a prisoner,"
2421,There to remain till the King’s further pleasure
2422,"Be known unto us. Are you all agreed, lords?"
2423,Is there no other way of mercy
2424,"But I must needs to th’ Tower, my lords?"
2425,Would you expect? You are strangely troublesome.
2426,Let some o’ th’ guard be ready there.
2427,Must I go like a traitor thither?
2428,And see him safe i’ th’ Tower.
2429,"Stay, good my lords,"
2430,"I have a little yet to say. Look there, my lords."
2431,"By virtue of that ring, I take my cause"
2432,Out of the gripes of cruel men and give it
2433,"To a most noble judge, the King my master."
2434,This is the King’s ring.
2435,"’Tis the right ring, by heaven! I told ye all,"
2436,"When we first put this dangerous stone a-rolling,"
2437,’Twould fall upon ourselves.
2438,"Do you think, my lords,"
2439,The King will suffer but the little finger
2440,Of this man to be vexed?
2441,’Tis now too certain.
2442,How much more is his life in value with him?
2443,Would I were fairly out on’t!
2444,"My mind gave me,"
2445,In seeking tales and informations
2446,"Against this man, whose honesty the devil"
2447,"And his disciples only envy at,"
2448,Ye blew the fire that burns ye. Now have at ye!
2449,"Enter King, frowning on them; takes his seat."
2450,"Dread sovereign, how much are we bound to heaven"
2451,"In daily thanks, that gave us such a prince,"
2452,"Not only good and wise, but most religious;"
2453,"One that, in all obedience, makes the Church"
2454,"The chief aim of his honour and, to strengthen"
2455,"That holy duty out of dear respect,"
2456,His royal self in judgement comes to hear
2457,The cause betwixt her and this great offender.
2458,"You were ever good at sudden commendations,"
2459,Bishop of Winchester. But know I come not
2460,"To hear such flattery now, and in my presence"
2461,They are too thin and bare to hide offences.
2462,"To me you cannot reach, you play the spaniel,"
2463,And think with wagging of your tongue to win me;
2464,"But whatsoe’er thou tak’st me for, I’m sure"
2465,Thou hast a cruel nature and a bloody.
2466,"He, that dares most, but wag his finger at thee."
2467,"By all that’s holy, he had better starve"
2468,Than but once think this place becomes thee not.
2469,May it please your Grace—
2470,"No, sir, it does not please me."
2471,I had thought I had had men of some understanding
2472,"And wisdom of my Council, but I find none."
2473,"Was it discretion, lords, to let this man,"
2474,This good man—few of you deserve that title—
2475,"This honest man, wait like a lousy footboy"
2476,At chamber door? And one as great as you are?
2477,"Why, what a shame was this! Did my commission"
2478,Bid ye so far forget yourselves? I gave ye
2479,"Power as he was a councillor to try him,"
2480,"Not as a groom. There’s some of ye, I see,"
2481,"More out of malice than integrity,"
2482,"Would try him to the utmost, had ye mean,"
2483,Which ye shall never have while I live.
2484,"My most dread sovereign, may it like your Grace"
2485,To let my tongue excuse all. What was purposed
2486,"Concerning his imprisonment was rather,"
2487,"If there be faith in men, meant for his trial"
2488,"And fair purgation to the world than malice,"
2489,"I’m sure, in me."
2490,"Well, well, my lords, respect him."
2491,"Take him, and use him well; he’s worthy of it."
2492,I will say thus much for him: if a prince
2493,"May be beholding to a subject, I"
2494,"Am, for his love and service, so to him."
2495,"Make me no more ado, but all embrace him."
2496,"Be friends, for shame, my lords! My Lord of Canterbury,"
2497,I have a suit which you must not deny me:
2498,"That is, a fair young maid that yet wants baptism."
2499,You must be godfather and answer for her.
2500,The greatest monarch now alive may glory
2501,"In such an honour. How may I deserve it,"
2502,That am a poor and humble subject to you?
2503,"Come, come, my lord, you’d spare your spoons. You shall have two noble"
2504,partners with you: the old Duchess of Norfolk and Lady Marquess Dorset.
2505,Will these please you?
2506,"Once more, my Lord of Winchester, I charge you,"
2507,Embrace and love this man.
2508,With a true heart
2509,And brother-love I do it.
2510,Witness how dear I hold this confirmation.
2511,"Good man, those joyful tears show thy true heart."
2512,"The common voice, I see, is verified"
2513,"Of thee, which says thus: “Do my Lord of Canterbury"
2514,"A shrewd turn, and he is your friend for ever.”"
2515,"Come, lords, we trifle time away. I long"
2516,To have this young one made a Christian.
2517,"As I have made ye one, lords, one remain."
2518,"So I grow stronger, you more honour gain."
2519,SCENE III. The palace yard.
2520,Noise and tumult within. Enter Porter and his Man.
2521,"You’ll leave your noise anon, ye rascals. Do you take the court for"
2522,"Parish Garden? Ye rude slaves, leave your gaping."
2523,"Belong to th’ gallows, and be hanged, ye rogue! Is this a place to roar"
2524,"in? Fetch me a dozen crab-tree staves, and strong ones. These are but"
2525,switches to ’em. I’ll scratch your heads. You must be seeing
2526,"christenings? Do you look for ale and cakes here, you rude rascals?"
2527,"Pray, sir, be patient. ’Tis as much impossible—"
2528,Unless we sweep ’em from the door with cannons—
2529,To scatter ’em as ’tis to make ’em sleep
2530,"On May-day morning, which will never be."
2531,We may as well push against Paul’s as stir ’em.
2532,"How got they in, and be hanged?"
2533,"Alas, I know not. How gets the tide in?"
2534,As much as one sound cudgel of four foot—
2535,"You see the poor remainder—could distribute,"
2536,"I made no spare, sir."
2537,"You did nothing, sir."
2538,"I am not Samson, nor Sir Guy, nor Colbrand,"
2539,To mow ’em down before me; but if I spared any
2540,"That had a head to hit, either young or old,"
2541,"He or she, cuckold or cuckold-maker,"
2542,Let me ne’er hope to see a chine again—
2543,"And that I would not for a cow, God save her!"
2544,"I shall be with you presently, good master puppy.—"
2545,"Keep the door close, sirrah."
2546,What would you have me do?
2547,"What should you do, but knock ’em down by th’ dozens? Is this"
2548,Moorfields to muster in? Or have we some strange Indian with the great
2549,"tool come to court, the women so besiege us? Bless me, what a fry of"
2550,"fornication is at door! On my Christian conscience, this one"
2551,"christening will beget a thousand; here will be father, godfather, and"
2552,"The spoons will be the bigger, sir. There is a fellow somewhat near the"
2553,"door—he should be a brazier by his face, for, o’ my conscience, twenty"
2554,of the dog-days now reign in’s nose. All that stand about him are under
2555,the line; they need no other penance. That fire-drake did I hit three
2556,"times on the head, and three times was his nose discharged against me."
2557,"He stands there, like a mortar-piece, to blow us. There was a"
2558,haberdasher’s wife of small wit near him that railed upon me till her
2559,pinked porringer fell off her head for kindling such a combustion in
2560,"the state. I missed the meteor once and hit that woman, who cried out"
2561,“Clubs!” when I might see from far some forty truncheoners draw to her
2562,"succour, which were the hope o’ th’ Strand, where she was quartered."
2563,They fell on; I made good my place; at length they came to th’
2564,"broomstaff to me; I defied ’em still, when suddenly a file of boys"
2565,"behind ’em, loose shot, delivered such a shower of pebbles that I was"
2566,fain to draw mine honour in and let ’em win the work. The devil was
2567,"amongst ’em, I think, surely."
2568,These are the youths that thunder at a playhouse and fight for bitten
2569,"apples, that no audience but the tribulation of Tower Hill or the limbs"
2570,"of Limehouse, their dear brothers, are able to endure. I have some of"
2571,"’em in _Limbo Patrum_, and there they are like to dance these three"
2572,"days, besides the running banquet of two beadles that is to come."
2573,"Mercy o’ me, what a multitude are here!"
2574,"They grow still too. From all parts they are coming,"
2575,"As if we kept a fair here! Where are these porters,"
2576,"These lazy knaves? You’ve made a fine hand, fellows!"
2577,There’s a trim rabble let in. Are all these
2578,Your faithful friends o’ th’ suburbs? We shall have
2579,"Great store of room, no doubt, left for the ladies,"
2580,When they pass back from the christening.
2581,"An’t please your honour,"
2582,"We are but men; and what so many may do,"
2583,"Not being torn a-pieces, we have done."
2584,An army cannot rule ’em.
2585,"If the King blame me for’t, I’ll lay ye all"
2586,"By th’ heels, and suddenly, and on your heads"
2587,"Clap round fines for neglect. You’re lazy knaves,"
2588,"And here ye lie baiting of bombards, when"
2589,"Ye should do service. Hark, the trumpets sound!"
2590,They’re come already from the christening.
2591,"Go break among the press, and find a way out"
2592,"To let the troops pass fairly, or I’ll find"
2593,A Marshalsea shall hold ye play these two months.
2594,Make way there for the Princess!
2595,"Stand close up, or I’ll make your head ache."
2596,"You i’ th’ camlet, get up o’ th’ rail!"
2597,I’ll peck you o’er the pales else.
2598,SCENE IV. The palace.
2599,"Enter Trumpets, sounding; then two Aldermen, Lord Mayor, Garter,"
2600,"Cranmer, Duke of Norfolk with his marshal’s staff, Duke of Suffolk, two"
2601,Noblemen bearing great standing bowls for the christening gifts; then
2602,"four Noblemen bearing a canopy, under which the Duchess of Norfolk,"
2603,"godmother, bearing the child richly habited in a mantle, etc., train"
2604,"borne by a Lady; then follows the Marchioness Dorset, the other"
2605,"godmother, and Ladies. The troop pass once about the stage, and Garter"
2606,"Heaven, from thy endless goodness, send prosperous life, long and ever"
2607,"happy, to the high and mighty Princess of England, Elizabeth."
2608,Flourish. Enter King and Guard.
2609,My noble partners and myself thus pray
2610,"All comfort, joy, in this most gracious lady"
2611,Heaven ever laid up to make parents happy
2612,May hourly fall upon ye!
2613,"Thank you, good lord Archbishop."
2614,What is her name?
2615,"With this kiss take my blessing: God protect thee,"
2616,Into whose hand I give thy life.
2617,"My noble gossips, you’ve have been too prodigal."
2618,"I thank ye heartily; so shall this lady,"
2619,When she has so much English.
2620,"Let me speak, sir,"
2621,For heaven now bids me; and the words I utter
2622,"Let none think flattery, for they’ll find ’em truth."
2623,This royal infant—heaven still move about her!—
2624,"Though in her cradle, yet now promises"
2625,"Upon this land a thousand thousand blessings,"
2626,Which time shall bring to ripeness. She shall be—
2627,But few now living can behold that goodness—
2628,A pattern to all princes living with her
2629,And all that shall succeed. Saba was never
2630,More covetous of wisdom and fair virtue
2631,Than this pure soul shall be. All princely graces
2632,"That mould up such a mighty piece as this is,"
2633,"With all the virtues that attend the good,"
2634,Shall still be doubled on her. Truth shall nurse her;
2635,Holy and heavenly thoughts still counsel her.
2636,She shall be loved and feared. Her own shall bless her;
2637,"Her foes shake like a field of beaten corn,"
2638,And hang their heads with sorrow. Good grows with her.
2639,In her days every man shall eat in safety
2640,"Under his own vine what he plants, and sing"
2641,The merry songs of peace to all his neighbours.
2642,"God shall be truly known, and those about her"
2643,From her shall read the perfect ways of honour
2644,"And by those claim their greatness, not by blood."
2645,Nor shall this peace sleep with her; but as when
2646,"The bird of wonder dies, the maiden phoenix,"
2647,Her ashes new create another heir
2648,"As great in admiration as herself,"
2649,"So shall she leave her blessedness to one,"
2650,"When heaven shall call her from this cloud of darkness,"
2651,Who from the sacred ashes of her honour
2652,Shall star-like rise as great in fame as she was
2653,"And so stand fixed. Peace, plenty, love, truth, terror,"
2654,"That were the servants to this chosen infant,"
2655,"Shall then be his, and like a vine grow to him."
2656,"Wherever the bright sun of heaven shall shine,"
2657,His honour and the greatness of his name
2658,"Shall be, and make new nations. He shall flourish,"
2659,"And, like a mountain cedar, reach his branches"
2660,To all the plains about him. Our children’s children
2661,Shall see this and bless heaven.
2662,She shall be to the happiness of England
2663,"An aged princess; many days shall see her,"
2664,And yet no day without a deed to crown it.
2665,"Would I had known no more! But she must die,"
2666,"She must, the saints must have her; yet a virgin,"
2667,"A most unspotted lily, shall she pass to the ground,"
2668,And all the world shall mourn her.
2669,Thou hast made me now a man. Never before
2670,This happy child did I get anything.
2671,This oracle of comfort has so pleased me
2672,That when I am in heaven I shall desire
2673,To see what this child does and praise my Maker.
2674,"I thank ye all. To you, my good Lord Mayor,"
2675,"And you, good brethren, I am much beholding."
2676,"I have received much honour by your presence,"
2677,"And ye shall find me thankful. Lead the way, lords."
2678,"Ye must all see the Queen, and she must thank ye;"
2679,"She will be sick else. This day, no man think"
2680,"’Has business at his house, for all shall stay."
2681,This little one shall make it holiday.
2682,’Tis ten to one this play can never please
2683,"All that are here. Some come to take their ease,"
2684,"And sleep an act or two—but those, we fear,"
2685,"We’ve frighted with our trumpets; so, ’tis clear,"
2686,"They’ll say ’tis naught—others, to hear the city"
2687,Abused extremely and to cry “That’s witty!”—
2688,Which we have not done neither—that I fear
2689,All the expected good we’re like to hear
2690,For this play at this time is only in
2691,"The merciful construction of good women,"
2692,For such a one we showed ’em. If they smile
2693,"And say ’twill do, I know within a while"
2694,All the best men are ours; for ’tis ill hap
2695,If they hold when their ladies bid ’em clap.

2749,Thy nephew and right royal sovereign.
2750,What follows if we disallow of this?
2751,"The proud control of fierce and bloody war,"
2752,To enforce these rights so forcibly withheld.
2753,"Here have we war for war and blood for blood,"
2754,Controlment for controlment: so answer France.
2755,"Then take my king’s defiance from my mouth,"
2756,The farthest limit of my embassy.
2757,"Bear mine to him, and so depart in peace."
2758,"Be thou as lightning in the eyes of France,"
2759,"For ere thou canst report, I will be there,"
2760,The thunder of my cannon shall be heard.
2761,"So, hence! Be thou the trumpet of our wrath"
2762,And sullen presage of your own decay.—
2763,An honourable conduct let him have.
2764,"Pembroke, look to ’t. Farewell, Chatillion."
2765,"What now, my son! Have I not ever said"
2766,How that ambitious Constance would not cease
2767,Till she had kindled France and all the world
2768,Upon the right and party of her son?
2769,This might have been prevented and made whole
2770,"With very easy arguments of love,"
2771,Which now the manage of two kingdoms must
2772,With fearful bloody issue arbitrate.
2773,Our strong possession and our right for us.
2774,"Your strong possession much more than your right,"
2775,Or else it must go wrong with you and me:
2776,"So much my conscience whispers in your ear,"
2777,Which none but heaven and you and I shall hear.
2778,"Enter a Sheriff, who whispers to Essex."
2779,"My liege, here is the strangest controversy,"
2780,"Come from the country to be judg’d by you,"
2781,That e’er I heard. Shall I produce the men?
2782,Our abbeys and our priories shall pay
2783,"Enter Robert Faulconbridge and Philip, his Bastard brother."
2784,What men are you?
2785,"Your faithful subject I, a gentleman"
2786,"Born in Northamptonshire, and eldest son,"
2787,"As I suppose, to Robert Faulconbridge,"
2788,A soldier by the honour-giving hand
2789,Of Cœur-de-lion knighted in the field.
2790,The son and heir to that same Faulconbridge.
2791,"Is that the elder, and art thou the heir?"
2792,"You came not of one mother then, it seems."
2793,"Most certain of one mother, mighty king;"
2794,"That is well known; and, as I think, one father."
2795,But for the certain knowledge of that truth
2796,I put you o’er to heaven and to my mother.
2797,"Of that I doubt, as all men’s children may."
2798,"Out on thee, rude man! Thou dost shame thy mother"
2799,And wound her honour with this diffidence.
2800,"I, madam? No, I have no reason for it;"
2801,"That is my brother’s plea, and none of mine;"
2802,"The which if he can prove, he pops me out"
2803,At least from fair five hundred pound a year.
2804,Heaven guard my mother’s honour and my land!
2805,"A good blunt fellow. Why, being younger born,"
2806,Doth he lay claim to thine inheritance?
2807,"I know not why, except to get the land."
2808,But once he slander’d me with bastardy.
2809,"But whe’er I be as true begot or no,"
2810,That still I lay upon my mother’s head;
2811,"But that I am as well begot, my liege—"
2812,Fair fall the bones that took the pains for me!—
2813,Compare our faces and be judge yourself.
2814,If old Sir Robert did beget us both
2815,"And were our father, and this son like him,"
2816,"O old Sir Robert, father, on my knee"
2817,I give heaven thanks I was not like to thee!
2818,"Why, what a madcap hath heaven lent us here!"
2819,He hath a trick of Cœur-de-lion’s face;
2820,The accent of his tongue affecteth him.
2821,Do you not read some tokens of my son
2822,In the large composition of this man?
2823,Mine eye hath well examined his parts
2824,"And finds them perfect Richard. Sirrah, speak,"
2825,What doth move you to claim your brother’s land?
2826,"Because he hath a half-face, like my father."
2827,With half that face would he have all my land:
2828,A half-fac’d groat five hundred pound a year!
2829,"My gracious liege, when that my father liv’d,"
2830,Your brother did employ my father much—
2831,"Well, sir, by this you cannot get my land."
2832,Your tale must be how he employ’d my mother.
2833,And once dispatch’d him in an embassy
2834,"To Germany, there with the emperor"
2835,To treat of high affairs touching that time.
2836,Th’ advantage of his absence took the King
2837,And in the meantime sojourn’d at my father’s;
2838,Where how he did prevail I shame to speak;
2839,But truth is truth: large lengths of seas and shores
2840,"Between my father and my mother lay,"
2841,"As I have heard my father speak himself,"
2842,When this same lusty gentleman was got.
2843,Upon his death-bed he by will bequeath’d
2844,"His lands to me, and took it, on his death"
2845,That this my mother’s son was none of his;
2846,"And if he were, he came into the world"
2847,Full fourteen weeks before the course of time.
2848,"Then, good my liege, let me have what is mine,"
2849,"My father’s land, as was my father’s will."
2850,"Sirrah, your brother is legitimate;"
2851,"Your father’s wife did after wedlock bear him,"
2852,"And if she did play false, the fault was hers;"
2853,Which fault lies on the hazards of all husbands
2854,"That marry wives. Tell me, how if my brother,"
2855,"Who, as you say, took pains to get this son,"
2856,Had of your father claim’d this son for his?
2857,"In sooth, good friend, your father might have kept"
2858,"This calf, bred from his cow, from all the world;"
2859,"In sooth, he might; then, if he were my brother’s,"
2860,"My brother might not claim him; nor your father,"
2861,"Being none of his, refuse him. This concludes;"
2862,My mother’s son did get your father’s heir;
2863,Your father’s heir must have your father’s land.
2864,Shall then my father’s will be of no force
2865,To dispossess that child which is not his?
2866,"Of no more force to dispossess me, sir,"
2867,"Than was his will to get me, as I think."
2868,Whether hadst thou rather be: a Faulconbridge
2869,"And like thy brother, to enjoy thy land,"
2870,"Or the reputed son of Cœur-de-lion,"
2871,Lord of thy presence and no land besides?
2872,"Madam, and if my brother had my shape"
2873,"And I had his, Sir Robert’s his, like him;"
2874,"And if my legs were two such riding-rods,"
2875,"My arms such eel-skins stuff’d, my face so thin"
2876,That in mine ear I durst not stick a rose
2877,Lest men should say “Look where three-farthings goes!”
2878,"And, to his shape, were heir to all this land,"
2879,"Would I might never stir from off this place,"
2880,I would give it every foot to have this face.
2881,I would not be Sir Nob in any case.
2882,"I like thee well. Wilt thou forsake thy fortune,"
2883,"Bequeath thy land to him, and follow me?"
2884,I am a soldier and now bound to France.
2885,"Brother, take you my land, I’ll take my chance."
2886,"Your face hath got five hundred pound a year,"
2887,Yet sell your face for five pence and ’tis dear.
2888,"Madam, I’ll follow you unto the death."
2889,"Nay, I would have you go before me thither."
2890,Our country manners give our betters way.
2891,What is thy name?
2892,"Philip, my liege, so is my name begun;"
2893,"Philip, good old Sir Robert’s wife’s eldest son."
2894,From henceforth bear his name whose form thou bearest.
2895,"Kneel thou down Philip, but rise more great,"
2896,Arise Sir Richard and Plantagenet.
2897,"Brother by th’ mother’s side, give me your hand."
2898,"My father gave me honour, yours gave land."
2899,"Now blessed be the hour, by night or day,"
2900,"When I was got, Sir Robert was away!"
2901,The very spirit of Plantagenet!
2902,"I am thy grandam, Richard; call me so."
2903,"Madam, by chance but not by truth; what though?"
2904,"Something about, a little from the right,"
2905,"In at the window, or else o’er the hatch."
2906,"Who dares not stir by day must walk by night,"
2907,"And have is have, however men do catch."
2908,"Near or far off, well won is still well shot,"
2909,"And I am I, howe’er I was begot."
2910,"Go, Faulconbridge; now hast thou thy desire."
2911,A landless knight makes thee a landed squire.
2912,"Come, madam, and come, Richard, we must speed"
2913,"For France, for France, for it is more than need."
2914,"Brother, adieu, good fortune come to thee!"
2915,For thou wast got i’ th’ way of honesty.
2916,"A foot of honour better than I was,"
2917,But many a many foot of land the worse.
2918,"Well, now can I make any Joan a lady."
2919,"“Good den, Sir Richard!” “God-a-mercy, fellow!”"
2920,"And if his name be George, I’ll call him Peter;"
2921,For new-made honour doth forget men’s names:
2922,’Tis too respective and too sociable
2923,"For your conversion. Now your traveller,"
2924,"He and his toothpick at my worship’s mess,"
2925,"And when my knightly stomach is suffic’d,"
2926,Why then I suck my teeth and catechize
2927,"My picked man of countries: “My dear sir,”"
2928,"Thus leaning on mine elbow I begin,"
2929,“I shall beseech you”—that is Question now;
2930,And then comes Answer like an absey book:
2931,"“O sir,” says Answer “at your best command;"
2932,"At your employment; at your service, sir.”"
2933,"“No, sir,” says Question, “I, sweet sir, at yours.”"
2934,"And so, ere Answer knows what Question would,"
2935,"Saving in dialogue of compliment,"
2936,"And talking of the Alps and Apennines,"
2937,"The Pyrenean and the river Po,"
2938,It draws toward supper in conclusion so.
2939,"But this is worshipful society,"
2940,And fits the mounting spirit like myself;
2941,For he is but a bastard to the time
2942,"That doth not smack of observation,"
2943,"And so am I, whether I smack or no;"
2944,"And not alone in habit and device,"
2945,"Exterior form, outward accoutrement,"
2946,But from the inward motion to deliver
2947,"Sweet, sweet, sweet poison for the age’s tooth,"
2948,"Which, though I will not practise to deceive,"
2949,"Yet, to avoid deceit, I mean to learn;"
2950,For it shall strew the footsteps of my rising.
2951,But who comes in such haste in riding-robes?
2952,What woman-post is this? Hath she no husband
2953,That will take pains to blow a horn before her?
2954,Enter Lady Faulconbridge and James Gurney.
2955,"O me, ’tis my mother!—How now, good lady?"
2956,What brings you here to court so hastily?
2957,"Where is that slave, thy brother? Where is he"
2958,That holds in chase mine honour up and down?
2959,"My brother Robert, old Sir Robert’s son?"
2960,"Colbrand the giant, that same mighty man?"
2961,Is it Sir Robert’s son that you seek so?
2962,"Sir Robert’s son! Ay, thou unreverend boy,"
2963,Sir Robert’s son. Why scorn’st thou at Sir Robert?
2964,"He is Sir Robert’s son, and so art thou."
2965,"James Gurney, wilt thou give us leave awhile?"
2966,"Good leave, good Philip."
2967,There’s toys abroad. Anon I’ll tell thee more.
2968,"Madam, I was not old Sir Robert’s son."
2969,Sir Robert might have eat his part in me
2970,"Upon Good Friday, and ne’er broke his fast."
2971,"Sir Robert could do well—marry, to confess—"
2972,Could … get me. Sir Robert could not do it.
2973,"We know his handiwork. Therefore, good mother,"
2974,To whom am I beholding for these limbs?
2975,Sir Robert never holp to make this leg.
2976,"Hast thou conspired with thy brother too,"
2977,That for thine own gain shouldst defend mine honour?
2978,"What means this scorn, thou most untoward knave?"
2979,"Knight, knight, good mother, Basilisco-like."
2980,What! I am dubb’d! I have it on my shoulder.
2981,"But, mother, I am not Sir Robert’s son."
2982,I have disclaim’d Sir Robert and my land;
2983,"Legitimation, name, and all is gone."
2984,"Then, good my mother, let me know my father—"
2985,"Some proper man, I hope. Who was it, mother?"
2986,Hast thou denied thyself a Faulconbridge?
2987,As faithfully as I deny the devil.
2988,King Richard Cœur-de-lion was thy father.
2989,By long and vehement suit I was seduc’d
2990,To make room for him in my husband’s bed.
2991,Heaven lay not my transgression to my charge!
2992,"Thou art the issue of my dear offence,"
2993,"Which was so strongly urg’d, past my defence."
2994,"Now, by this light, were I to get again,"
2995,"Madam, I would not wish a better father."
2996,"Some sins do bear their privilege on earth,"
2997,And so doth yours. Your fault was not your folly.
2998,"Needs must you lay your heart at his dispose,"
2999,"Subjected tribute to commanding love,"
3000,Against whose fury and unmatched force
3001,"The aweless lion could not wage the fight,"
3002,Nor keep his princely heart from Richard’s hand.
3003,He that perforce robs lions of their hearts
3004,"May easily win a woman’s. Ay, my mother,"
3005,With all my heart I thank thee for my father!
3006,Who lives and dares but say thou didst not well
3007,"When I was got, I’ll send his soul to hell."
3008,"Come, lady, I will show thee to my kin;"
3009,"And they shall say when Richard me begot,"
3010,"If thou hadst said him nay, it had been sin."
3011,"Who says it was, he lies. I say ’twas not."
3012,SCENE I. France. Before the walls of Angiers.
3013,"Enter, on one side, the  Archduke of Austria and Forces; on the other,"
3014,"Philip King of France, Louis, Constance, Arthur and Forces."
3015,"Before Angiers well met, brave Austria."
3016,"Arthur, that great forerunner of thy blood,"
3017,"Richard, that robb’d the lion of his heart"
3018,"And fought the holy wars in Palestine,"
3019,By this brave duke came early to his grave.
3020,"And, for amends to his posterity,"
3021,At our importance hither is he come
3022,"To spread his colours, boy, in thy behalf,"
3023,And to rebuke the usurpation
3024,"Of thy unnatural uncle, English John."
3025,"Embrace him, love him, give him welcome hither."
3026,God shall forgive you Cœur-de-lion’s death
3027,"The rather that you give his offspring life,"
3028,Shadowing their right under your wings of war.
3029,"I give you welcome with a powerless hand,"
3030,But with a heart full of unstained love.
3031,"Welcome before the gates of Angiers, duke."
3032,A noble boy. Who would not do thee right?
3033,"Upon thy cheek lay I this zealous kiss,"
3034,As seal to this indenture of my love:
3035,"That to my home I will no more return,"
3036,"Till Angiers and the right thou hast in France,"
3037,"Together with that pale, that white-fac’d shore,"
3038,Whose foot spurns back the ocean’s roaring tides
3039,"And coops from other lands her islanders,"
3040,"Even till that England, hedg’d in with the main,"
3041,"That water-walled bulwark, still secure"
3042,"And confident from foreign purposes,"
3043,Even till that utmost corner of the west
3044,"Salute thee for her king; till then, fair boy,"
3045,"Will I not think of home, but follow arms."
3046,"O, take his mother’s thanks, a widow’s thanks,"
3047,Till your strong hand shall help to give him strength
3048,To make a more requital to your love!
3049,The peace of heaven is theirs that lift their swords
3050,In such a just and charitable war.
3051,"Well then, to work; our cannon shall be bent"
3052,Against the brows of this resisting town.
3053,"Call for our chiefest men of discipline,"
3054,To cull the plots of best advantages.
3055,"We’ll lay before this town our royal bones,"
3056,"Wade to the market-place in Frenchmen’s blood,"
3057,But we will make it subject to this boy.
3058,"Stay for an answer to your embassy,"
3059,Lest unadvis’d you stain your swords with blood.
3060,My Lord Chatillion may from England bring
3061,"That right in peace which here we urge in war,"
3062,And then we shall repent each drop of blood
3063,That hot rash haste so indirectly shed.
3064,"A wonder, lady! Lo, upon thy wish,"
3065,Our messenger Chatillion is arriv’d.
3066,"What England says, say briefly, gentle lord;"
3067,"We coldly pause for thee; Chatillion, speak."
3068,Then turn your forces from this paltry siege
3069,And stir them up against a mightier task.
3070,"England, impatient of your just demands,"
3071,"Hath put himself in arms. The adverse winds,"
3072,"Whose leisure I have stay’d, have given him time"
3073,To land his legions all as soon as I;
3074,"His marches are expedient to this town,"
3075,"His forces strong, his soldiers confident."
3076,"With him along is come the mother-queen,"
3077,"An Ate, stirring him to blood and strife;"
3078,"With her her niece, the Lady Blanche of Spain;"
3079,With them a bastard of the King’s deceas’d.
3080,And all th’ unsettled humours of the land;
3081,"Rash, inconsiderate, fiery voluntaries,"
3082,"With ladies’ faces and fierce dragons’ spleens,"
3083,"Have sold their fortunes at their native homes,"
3084,"Bearing their birthrights proudly on their backs,"
3085,To make a hazard of new fortunes here.
3086,"In brief, a braver choice of dauntless spirits"
3087,Than now the English bottoms have waft o’er
3088,Did never float upon the swelling tide
3089,To do offence and scathe in Christendom.
3090,The interruption of their churlish drums
3091,"Cuts off more circumstance. They are at hand,"
3092,"To parley or to fight, therefore prepare."
3093,How much unlook’d-for is this expedition!
3094,"By how much unexpected, by so much"
3095,"We must awake endeavour for defence,"
3096,For courage mounteth with occasion.
3097,"Let them be welcome, then; we are prepar’d."
3098,"Enter King John, Eleanor, Blanche, the Bastard, Pembroke, Lords and"
3099,"Peace be to France, if France in peace permit"
3100,Our just and lineal entrance to our own;
3101,"If not, bleed France, and peace ascend to heaven,"
3102,"Whiles we, God’s wrathful agent, do correct"
3103,Their proud contempt that beats his peace to heaven.
3104,"Peace be to England, if that war return"
3105,"From France to England, there to live in peace."
3106,England we love; and for that England’s sake
3107,With burden of our armour here we sweat.
3108,This toil of ours should be a work of thine;
3109,But thou from loving England art so far
3110,"That thou hast underwrought his lawful king,"
3111,"Cut off the sequence of posterity,"
3112,"Outfaced infant state, and done a rape"
3113,Upon the maiden virtue of the crown.
3114,Look here upon thy brother Geoffrey’s face;
3115,"These eyes, these brows, were moulded out of his:"
3116,This little abstract doth contain that large
3117,"Which died in Geoffrey, and the hand of time"
3118,Shall draw this brief into as huge a volume.
3119,"That Geoffrey was thy elder brother born,"
3120,"And this his son; England was Geoffrey’s right,"
3121,"And this is Geoffrey’s. In the name of God,"
3122,"How comes it then that thou art call’d a king,"
3123,"When living blood doth in these temples beat,"
3124,Which owe the crown that thou o’ermasterest?
3125,"From whom hast thou this great commission, France,"
3126,To draw my answer from thy articles?
3127,From that supernal judge that stirs good thoughts
3128,"In any breast of strong authority,"
3129,To look into the blots and stains of right.
3130,"That judge hath made me guardian to this boy,"
3131,Under whose warrant I impeach thy wrong
3132,And by whose help I mean to chastise it.
3133,"Alack, thou dost usurp authority."
3134,Excuse it is to beat usurping down.
3135,"Who is it thou dost call usurper, France?"
3136,Let me make answer: thy usurping son.
3137,"Out, insolent! Thy bastard shall be king,"
3138,"That thou mayst be a queen, and check the world!"
3139,My bed was ever to thy son as true
3140,As thine was to thy husband; and this boy
3141,Liker in feature to his father Geoffrey
3142,Than thou and John in manners; being as like
3143,"As rain to water, or devil to his dam."
3144,"My boy a bastard! By my soul, I think"
3145,His father never was so true begot:
3146,"It cannot be, and if thou wert his mother."
3147,"There’s a good mother, boy, that blots thy father."
3148,"There’s a good grandam, boy, that would blot thee."
3149,What the devil art thou?
3150,"One that will play the devil, sir, with you,"
3151,An he may catch your hide and you alone.
3152,"You are the hare of whom the proverb goes,"
3153,Whose valour plucks dead lions by the beard.
3154,I’ll smoke your skin-coat an I catch you right;
3155,"Sirrah, look to ’t; i’ faith I will, i’ faith."
3156,"O, well did he become that lion’s robe"
3157,That did disrobe the lion of that robe!
3158,It lies as sightly on the back of him
3159,As great Alcides’ shows upon an ass.
3160,"But, ass, I’ll take that burden from your back,"
3161,Or lay on that shall make your shoulders crack.
3162,What cracker is this same that deafs our ears
3163,With this abundance of superfluous breath?
3164,"Louis, determine what we shall do straight."
3165,"Women and fools, break off your conference."
3166,"King John, this is the very sum of all:"
3167,"England and Ireland, Anjou, Touraine, Maine,"
3168,In right of Arthur do I claim of thee.
3169,Wilt thou resign them and lay down thy arms?
3170,"My life as soon: I do defy thee, France."
3171,"Arthur of Brittany, yield thee to my hand;"
3172,And out of my dear love I’ll give thee more
3173,Than e’er the coward hand of France can win.
3174,"Come to thy grandam, child."
3175,"Do, child, go to it grandam, child."
3176,"Give grandam kingdom, and it grandam will"
3177,"Give it a plum, a cherry, and a fig."
3178,There’s a good grandam.
3179,"Good my mother, peace!"
3180,I would that I were low laid in my grave.
3181,I am not worth this coil that’s made for me.
3182,"His mother shames him so, poor boy, he weeps."
3183,"Now, shame upon you, whe’er she does or no!"
3184,"His grandam’s wrongs, and not his mother’s shames,"
3185,"Draws those heaven-moving pearls from his poor eyes,"
3186,Which heaven shall take in nature of a fee.
3187,"Ay, with these crystal beads heaven shall be brib’d"
3188,"To do him justice, and revenge on you."
3189,Thou monstrous slanderer of heaven and earth!
3190,Thou monstrous injurer of heaven and earth!
3191,Call not me slanderer. Thou and thine usurp
3192,"The dominations, royalties, and rights"
3193,"Of this oppressed boy. This is thy eldest son’s son,"
3194,Infortunate in nothing but in thee.
3195,Thy sins are visited in this poor child;
3196,"The canon of the law is laid on him,"
3197,Being but the second generation
3198,Removed from thy sin-conceiving womb.
3199,"I have but this to say,"
3200,"That he is not only plagued for her sin,"
3201,But God hath made her sin and her the plague
3202,"On this removed issue, plagued for her"
3203,And with her plague; her sin his injury
3204,"Her injury the beadle to her sin,"
3205,"All punish’d in the person of this child,"
3206,And all for her. A plague upon her!
3207,"Thou unadvised scold, I can produce"
3208,A will that bars the title of thy son.
3209,"Ay, who doubts that? A will, a wicked will;"
3210,A woman’s will; a cankered grandam’s will!
3211,"Peace, lady! Pause, or be more temperate."
3212,It ill beseems this presence to cry aim
3213,To these ill-tuned repetitions.—
3214,Some trumpet summon hither to the walls
3215,These men of Angiers. Let us hear them speak
3216,"Whose title they admit, Arthur’s or John’s."
3217,Trumpet sounds. Enter Citizens upon the walls.
3218,Who is it that hath warn’d us to the walls?
3219,"’Tis France, for England."
3220,"You men of Angiers, and my loving subjects—"
3221,"You loving men of Angiers, Arthur’s subjects,"
3222,Our trumpet call’d you to this gentle parle—
3223,For our advantage; therefore hear us first.
3224,"These flags of France, that are advanced here"
3225,"Before the eye and prospect of your town,"
3226,Have hither march’d to your endamagement.
3227,"The cannons have their bowels full of wrath,"
3228,And ready mounted are they to spit forth
3229,Their iron indignation ’gainst your walls.
3230,All preparation for a bloody siege
3231,And merciless proceeding by these French
3232,"Confronts your city’s eyes, your winking gates;"
3233,"And, but for our approach, those sleeping stones,"
3234,"That as a waist doth girdle you about,"
3235,By the compulsion of their ordinance
3236,By this time from their fixed beds of lime
3237,"Had been dishabited, and wide havoc made"
3238,For bloody power to rush upon your peace.
3239,"But on the sight of us your lawful king,"
3240,Who painfully with much expedient march
3241,"Have brought a countercheck before your gates,"
3242,"To save unscratch’d your city’s threatened cheeks,"
3243,"Behold, the French, amaz’d, vouchsafe a parle;"
3244,"And now, instead of bullets wrapp’d in fire,"
3245,"To make a shaking fever in your walls,"
3246,"They shoot but calm words folded up in smoke,"
3247,"To make a faithless error in your ears,"
3248,"Which trust accordingly, kind citizens,"
3249,"And let us in, your king, whose labour’d spirits"
3250,"Forwearied in this action of swift speed,"
3251,Craves harbourage within your city walls.
3252,"When I have said, make answer to us both."
3253,"Lo, in this right hand, whose protection"
3254,Is most divinely vow’d upon the right
3255,"Of him it holds, stands young Plantagenet,"
3256,"Son to the elder brother of this man,"
3257,And king o’er him and all that he enjoys.
3258,For this down-trodden equity we tread
3259,"In warlike march these greens before your town,"
3260,Being no further enemy to you
3261,Than the constraint of hospitable zeal
3262,In the relief of this oppressed child
3263,Religiously provokes. Be pleased then
3264,To pay that duty which you truly owe
3265,"To him that owes it, namely, this young prince,"
3266,"And then our arms, like to a muzzled bear,"
3267,"Save in aspect, hath all offence seal’d up;"
3268,Our cannons’ malice vainly shall be spent
3269,Against th’ invulnerable clouds of heaven;
3270,"And with a blessed and unvex’d retire,"
3271,"With unhack’d swords and helmets all unbruis’d,"
3272,We will bear home that lusty blood again
3273,"Which here we came to spout against your town,"
3274,"And leave your children, wives, and you, in peace."
3275,"But if you fondly pass our proffer’d offer,"
3276,’Tis not the roundure of your old-fac’d walls
3277,"Can hide you from our messengers of war,"
3278,"Though all these English, and their discipline"
3279,Were harbour’d in their rude circumference.
3280,"Then, tell us, shall your city call us lord"
3281,In that behalf which we have challeng’d it?
3282,Or shall we give the signal to our rage
3283,And stalk in blood to our possession?
3284,"In brief, we are the King of England’s subjects."
3285,"For him, and in his right, we hold this town."
3286,"Acknowledge then the King, and let me in."
3287,"That can we not; but he that proves the King,"
3288,To him will we prove loyal. Till that time
3289,Have we ramm’d up our gates against the world.
3290,Doth not the crown of England prove the King?
3291,"And if not that, I bring you witnesses,"
3292,Twice fifteen thousand hearts of England’s breed—
3293,To verify our title with their lives.
3294,As many and as well-born bloods as those—
3295,Stand in his face to contradict his claim.
3296,"Till you compound whose right is worthiest,"
3297,We for the worthiest hold the right from both.
3298,Then God forgive the sin of all those souls
3299,"That to their everlasting residence,"
3300,"Before the dew of evening fall, shall fleet,"
3301,In dreadful trial of our kingdom’s king!
3302,"Amen, Amen!—Mount, chevaliers! To arms!"
3303,"Saint George, that swinged the dragon, and e’er since"
3304,"Sits on ’s horseback at mine hostess’ door,"
3305,"Teach us some fence! [_To Austria_.] Sirrah, were I at home,"
3306,"At your den, sirrah, with your lioness,"
3307,"I would set an ox-head to your lion’s hide,"
3308,And make a monster of you.
3309,"O, tremble, for you hear the lion roar."
3310,Up higher to the plain; where we’ll set forth
3311,In best appointment all our regiments.
3312,"Speed, then, to take advantage of the field."
3313,It shall be so; and at the other hill
3314,Command the rest to stand. God and our right!
3315,"Here, after excursions, enter a Herald of France with Trumpets, to the"
3316,"You men of Angiers, open wide your gates,"
3317,"And let young Arthur, Duke of Brittany, in,"
3318,Who by the hand of France this day hath made
3319,"Much work for tears in many an English mother,"
3320,Whose sons lie scatter’d on the bleeding ground.
3321,"Many a widow’s husband grovelling lies,"
3322,Coldly embracing the discolour’d earth;
3323,"And victory, with little loss, doth play"
3324,"Upon the dancing banners of the French,"
3325,"Who are at hand, triumphantly display’d,"
3326,"To enter conquerors, and to proclaim"
3327,Arthur of Brittany England’s king and yours.
3328,Enter English Herald with Trumpet.
3329,"Rejoice, you men of Angiers, ring your bells:"
3330,"King John, your king and England’s, doth approach,"
3331,Commander of this hot malicious day.
3332,"Their armours, that march’d hence so silver-bright,"
3333,Hither return all gilt with Frenchmen’s blood;
3334,There stuck no plume in any English crest
3335,"That is removed by a staff of France,"
3336,Our colours do return in those same hands
3337,That did display them when we first march’d forth;
3338,"And, like a jolly troop of huntsmen, come"
3339,"Our lusty English, all with purpled hands,"
3340,Dyed in the dying slaughter of their foes:
3341,Open your gates and give the victors way.
3342,"Heralds, from off our towers, we might behold,"
3343,"From first to last, the onset and retire"
3344,Of both your armies; whose equality
3345,By our best eyes cannot be censured:
3346,"Blood hath bought blood, and blows have answer’d blows;"
3347,"Strength match’d with strength, and power confronted power:"
3348,"Both are alike, and both alike we like."
3349,"One must prove greatest: while they weigh so even,"
3350,"We hold our town for neither, yet for both."
3351,"Enter on one side King John, Eleanor, Blanche, the Bastard and Forces;"
3352,"on the other, King Philip, Louis, Austria and Forces."
3353,"France, hast thou yet more blood to cast away?"
3354,"Say, shall the current of our right run on,"
3355,"Whose passage, vex’d with thy impediment,"
3356,"Shall leave his native channel, and o’erswell"
3357,"With course disturb’d even thy confining shores,"
3358,Unless thou let his silver water keep
3359,A peaceful progress to the ocean?
3360,"England, thou hast not sav’d one drop of blood"
3361,"In this hot trial, more than we of France;"
3362,"Rather, lost more. And by this hand I swear,"
3363,"That sways the earth this climate overlooks,"
3364,"Before we will lay down our just-borne arms,"
3365,"We’ll put thee down, ’gainst whom these arms we bear,"
3366,"Or add a royal number to the dead,"
3367,Gracing the scroll that tells of this war’s loss
3368,With slaughter coupled to the name of kings.
3369,"Ha, majesty! How high thy glory towers"
3370,When the rich blood of kings is set on fire!
3371,"O, now doth Death line his dead chaps with steel;"
3372,"The swords of soldiers are his teeth, his fangs;"
3373,"And now he feasts, mousing the flesh of men,"
3374,In undetermin’d differences of kings.
3375,Why stand these royal fronts amazed thus?
3376,"Cry havoc, kings! Back to the stained field,"
3377,"You equal potents, fiery-kindled spirits!"
3378,Then let confusion of one part confirm
3379,"The other’s peace. Till then, blows, blood, and death!"
3380,Whose party do the townsmen yet admit?
3381,"Speak, citizens, for England; who’s your king?"
3382,"The King of England, when we know the king."
3383,"Know him in us, that here hold up his right."
3384,"In us, that are our own great deputy,"
3385,"And bear possession of our person here,"
3386,"Lord of our presence, Angiers, and of you."
3387,A greater power than we denies all this;
3388,"And till it be undoubted, we do lock"
3389,Our former scruple in our strong-barr’d gates:
3390,"Kings of our fear, until our fears, resolv’d,"
3391,Be by some certain king purg’d and depos’d.
3392,"By heaven, these scroyles of Angiers flout you, kings,"
3393,And stand securely on their battlements
3394,"As in a theatre, whence they gape and point"
3395,At your industrious scenes and acts of death.
3396,Your royal presences be rul’d by me:
3397,"Do like the mutines of Jerusalem,"
3398,"Be friends awhile, and both conjointly bend"
3399,Your sharpest deeds of malice on this town:
3400,By east and west let France and England mount
3401,"Their battering cannon charged to the mouths,"
3402,Till their soul-fearing clamours have brawl’d down
3403,The flinty ribs of this contemptuous city:
3404,"I’d play incessantly upon these jades,"
3405,Even till unfenced desolation
3406,Leave them as naked as the vulgar air.
3407,"That done, dissever your united strengths,"
3408,And part your mingled colours once again;
3409,"Turn face to face, and bloody point to point;"
3410,"Then, in a moment, Fortune shall cull forth"
3411,"Out of one side her happy minion,"
3412,"To whom in favour she shall give the day,"
3413,And kiss him with a glorious victory.
3414,"How like you this wild counsel, mighty states?"
3415,Smacks it not something of the policy?
3416,"Now, by the sky that hangs above our heads,"
3417,"I like it well. France, shall we knit our powers"
3418,And lay this Angiers even with the ground;
3419,Then after fight who shall be king of it?
3420,"An if thou hast the mettle of a king,"
3421,"Being wrong’d as we are by this peevish town,"
3422,"Turn thou the mouth of thy artillery,"
3423,"As we will ours, against these saucy walls;"
3424,"And when that we have dash’d them to the ground,"
3425,"Why then defy each other, and pell-mell,"
3426,"Make work upon ourselves, for heaven or hell."
3427,"Let it be so. Say, where will you assault?"
3428,We from the west will send destruction
3429,Into this city’s bosom.
3430,I from the north.
3431,Our thunder from the south
3432,Shall rain their drift of bullets on this town.
3433,"O prudent discipline! From north to south,"
3434,Austria and France shoot in each other’s mouth:
3435,"I’ll stir them to it.—Come, away, away!"
3436,"Hear us, great kings: vouchsafe awhile to stay,"
3437,And I shall show you peace and fair-fac’d league;
3438,Win you this city without stroke or wound;
3439,Rescue those breathing lives to die in beds
3440,That here come sacrifices for the field:
3441,"Persever not, but hear me, mighty kings."
3442,Speak on with favour; we are bent to hear.
3443,"That daughter there of Spain, the Lady Blanche,"
3444,Is niece to England. Look upon the years
3445,Of Louis the Dauphin and that lovely maid.
3446,"If lusty love should go in quest of beauty,"
3447,Where should he find it fairer than in Blanche?
3448,"If zealous love should go in search of virtue,"
3449,Where should he find it purer than in Blanche?
3450,"If love ambitious sought a match of birth,"
3451,Whose veins bound richer blood than Lady Blanche?
3452,"Such as she is, in beauty, virtue, birth,"
3453,Is the young Dauphin every way complete.
3454,"If not complete of, say he is not she;"
3455,"And she again wants nothing, to name want,"
3456,If want it be not that she is not he:
3457,"He is the half part of a blessed man,"
3458,Left to be finished by such a she;
3459,"And she a fair divided excellence,"
3460,Whose fulness of perfection lies in him.
3461,"O, two such silver currents, when they join"
3462,Do glorify the banks that bound them in;
3463,"And two such shores to two such streams made one,"
3464,"Two such controlling bounds shall you be, kings,"
3465,"To these two princes, if you marry them."
3466,This union shall do more than battery can
3467,"To our fast-closed gates; for at this match,"
3468,"With swifter spleen than powder can enforce,"
3469,"The mouth of passage shall we fling wide ope,"
3470,"And give you entrance. But without this match,"
3471,"The sea enraged is not half so deaf,"
3472,"Lions more confident, mountains and rocks"
3473,"More free from motion; no, not Death himself"
3474,In mortal fury half so peremptory
3475,As we to keep this city.
3476,That shakes the rotten carcass of old Death
3477,"Out of his rags! Here’s a large mouth indeed,"
3478,"That spits forth death and mountains, rocks and seas;"
3479,Talks as familiarly of roaring lions
3480,As maids of thirteen do of puppy-dogs!
3481,What cannoneer begot this lusty blood?
3482,"He speaks plain cannon, fire, and smoke, and bounce;"
3483,He gives the bastinado with his tongue;
3484,Our ears are cudgell’d; not a word of his
3485,But buffets better than a fist of France.
3486,Zounds! I was never so bethump’d with words
3487,Since I first call’d my brother’s father dad.
3488,"Son, list to this conjunction, make this match."
3489,"Give with our niece a dowry large enough,"
3490,For by this knot thou shalt so surely tie
3491,"Thy now unsur’d assurance to the crown,"
3492,That yon green boy shall have no sun to ripe
3493,The bloom that promiseth a mighty fruit.
3494,I see a yielding in the looks of France;
3495,Mark how they whisper. Urge them while their souls
3496,"Are capable of this ambition,"
3497,"Lest zeal, now melted by the windy breath"
3498,"Of soft petitions, pity, and remorse,"
3499,Cool and congeal again to what it was.
3500,Why answer not the double majesties
3501,This friendly treaty of our threaten’d town?
3502,"Speak England first, that hath been forward first"
3503,To speak unto this city. What say you?
3504,"If that the Dauphin there, thy princely son,"
3505,"Can in this book of beauty read “I love,”"
3506,Her dowry shall weigh equal with a queen.
3507,"For Anjou, and fair Touraine, Maine, Poitiers,"
3508,And all that we upon this side the sea—
3509,Except this city now by us besieg’d—
3510,"Find liable to our crown and dignity,"
3511,"Shall gild her bridal bed, and make her rich"
3512,"In titles, honours, and promotions,"
3513,"As she in beauty, education, blood,"
3514,Holds hand with any princess of the world.
3515,"What say’st thou, boy? Look in the lady’s face."
3516,"I do, my lord, and in her eye I find"
3517,"A wonder, or a wondrous miracle,"
3518,The shadow of myself form’d in her eye;
3519,"Which, being but the shadow of your son,"
3520,Becomes a sun and makes your son a shadow.
3521,I do protest I never lov’d myself
3522,Till now infixed I beheld myself
3523,Drawn in the flattering table of her eye.
3524,"Hang’d in the frowning wrinkle of her brow,"
3525,And quarter’d in her heart! He doth espy
3526,"Himself love’s traitor. This is pity now,"
3527,"That, hang’d and drawn and quarter’d, there should be"
3528,In such a love so vile a lout as he.
3529,My uncle’s will in this respect is mine.
3530,"If he see aught in you that makes him like,"
3531,"That anything he sees, which moves his liking"
3532,I can with ease translate it to my will;
3533,"Or if you will, to speak more properly,"
3534,I will enforce it eas’ly to my love.
3535,"Further I will not flatter you, my lord,"
3536,"That all I see in you is worthy love,"
3537,"Than this: that nothing do I see in you,"
3538,"Though churlish thoughts themselves should be your judge,"
3539,That I can find should merit any hate.
3540,"What say these young ones? What say you, my niece?"
3541,That she is bound in honour still to do
3542,What you in wisdom still vouchsafe to say.
3543,"Speak then, Prince Dauphin. Can you love this lady?"
3544,"Nay, ask me if I can refrain from love;"
3545,For I do love her most unfeignedly.
3546,"Then do I give Volquessen, Touraine, Maine,"
3547,"Poitiers, and Anjou, these five provinces,"
3548,"With her to thee; and this addition more,"
3549,Full thirty thousand marks of English coin.—
3550,"Philip of France, if thou be pleas’d withal,"
3551,Command thy son and daughter to join hands.
3552,"It likes us well.—Young princes, close your hands."
3553,And your lips too; for I am well assur’d
3554,That I did so when I was first assur’d.
3555,"Now, citizens of Angiers, ope your gates,"
3556,Let in that amity which you have made;
3557,For at Saint Mary’s chapel presently
3558,The rites of marriage shall be solemniz’d.
3559,Is not the Lady Constance in this troop?
3560,"I know she is not, for this match made up"
3561,Her presence would have interrupted much.
3562,"Where is she and her son? Tell me, who knows."
3563,She is sad and passionate at your highness’ tent.
3564,"And, by my faith, this league that we have made"
3565,Will give her sadness very little cure.—
3566,"Brother of England, how may we content"
3567,This widow lady? In her right we came;
3568,"Which we, God knows, have turn’d another way,"
3569,To our own vantage.
3570,We will heal up all;
3571,"For we’ll create young Arthur Duke of Brittany,"
3572,And Earl of Richmond; and this rich fair town
3573,We make him lord of. Call the Lady Constance.
3574,Some speedy messenger bid her repair
3575,"To our solemnity. I trust we shall,"
3576,"If not fill up the measure of her will,"
3577,Yet in some measure satisfy her so
3578,That we shall stop her exclamation.
3579,"Go we, as well as haste will suffer us,"
3580,"To this unlook’d-for, unprepared pomp."
3581,Mad world! mad kings! mad composition!
3582,"John, to stop Arthur’s title in the whole,"
3583,Hath willingly departed with a part;
3584,"And France, whose armour conscience buckled on,"
3585,Whom zeal and charity brought to the field
3586,"As God’s own soldier, rounded in the ear"
3587,"With that same purpose-changer, that sly devil,"
3588,"That broker, that still breaks the pate of faith,"
3589,"That daily break-vow, he that wins of all,"
3590,"Of kings, of beggars, old men, young men, maids,"
3591,Who having no external thing to lose
3592,"But the word “maid,” cheats the poor maid of that,"
3593,"That smooth-fac’d gentleman, tickling commodity,"
3594,"Commodity, the bias of the world,"
3595,"The world, who of itself is peised well,"
3596,"Made to run even upon even ground,"
3597,"Till this advantage, this vile-drawing bias,"
3598,"This sway of motion, this commodity,"
3599,"Makes it take head from all indifferency,"
3600,"From all direction, purpose, course, intent."
3601,"And this same bias, this commodity,"
3602,"This bawd, this broker, this all-changing word,"
3603,"Clapp’d on the outward eye of fickle France,"
3604,"Hath drawn him from his own determin’d aid,"
3605,"From a resolv’d and honourable war,"
3606,To a most base and vile-concluded peace.
3607,And why rail I on this commodity?
3608,But for because he hath not woo’d me yet.
3609,Not that I have the power to clutch my hand
3610,When his fair angels would salute my palm;
3611,"But for my hand, as unattempted yet,"
3612,"Like a poor beggar, raileth on the rich."
3613,"Well, whiles I am a beggar, I will rail"
3614,And say there is no sin but to be rich;
3615,"And being rich, my virtue then shall be"
3616,To say there is no vice but beggary.
3617,"Since kings break faith upon commodity,"
3618,"Gain, be my lord, for I will worship thee!"
3619,SCENE I. France. The French King’s tent.
3620,"Enter Constance, Arthur and Salisbury."
3621,Gone to be married? Gone to swear a peace?
3622,False blood to false blood join’d? Gone to be friends?
3623,"Shall Louis have Blanche, and Blanche those provinces?"
3624,"It is not so; thou hast misspoke, misheard;"
3625,"Be well advis’d, tell o’er thy tale again."
3626,It cannot be; thou dost but say ’tis so.
3627,"I trust I may not trust thee, for thy word"
3628,Is but the vain breath of a common man.
3629,"Believe me, I do not believe thee, man."
3630,I have a king’s oath to the contrary.
3631,"Thou shalt be punish’d for thus frighting me,"
3632,"For I am sick and capable of fears,"
3633,"Oppress’d with wrongs, and therefore full of fears,"
3634,"A widow, husbandless, subject to fears,"
3635,"A woman, naturally born to fears,"
3636,"And though thou now confess thou didst but jest,"
3637,"With my vex’d spirits I cannot take a truce,"
3638,But they will quake and tremble all this day.
3639,What dost thou mean by shaking of thy head?
3640,Why dost thou look so sadly on my son?
3641,What means that hand upon that breast of thine?
3642,"Why holds thine eye that lamentable rheum,"
3643,Like a proud river peering o’er his bounds?
3644,Be these sad signs confirmers of thy words?
3645,"Then speak again—not all thy former tale,"
3646,"But this one word, whether thy tale be true."
3647,As true as I believe you think them false
3648,That give you cause to prove my saying true.
3649,"O, if thou teach me to believe this sorrow,"
3650,"Teach thou this sorrow how to make me die,"
3651,And let belief and life encounter so
3652,As doth the fury of two desperate men
3653,Which in the very meeting fall and die.
3654,"Louis marry Blanche? O boy, then where art thou?"
3655,France friend with England? What becomes of me?
3656,"Fellow, be gone. I cannot brook thy sight."
3657,This news hath made thee a most ugly man.
3658,"What other harm have I, good lady, done,"
3659,But spoke the harm that is by others done?
3660,"Which harm within itself so heinous is,"
3661,As it makes harmful all that speak of it.
3662,"I do beseech you, madam, be content."
3663,"If thou, that bid’st me be content, wert grim,"
3664,"Ugly, and sland’rous to thy mother’s womb,"
3665,"Full of unpleasing blots and sightless stains,"
3666,"Lame, foolish, crooked, swart, prodigious,"
3667,"Patch’d with foul moles and eye-offending marks,"
3668,"I would not care, I then would be content,"
3669,"For then I should not love thee; no, nor thou"
3670,"Become thy great birth, nor deserve a crown."
3671,"But thou art fair, and at thy birth, dear boy,"
3672,Nature and Fortune join’d to make thee great.
3673,"Of Nature’s gifts thou mayst with lilies boast,"
3674,"And with the half-blown rose. But Fortune, O,"
3675,"She is corrupted, chang’d, and won from thee;"
3676,"She adulterates hourly with thine uncle John,"
3677,And with her golden hand hath pluck’d on France
3678,"To tread down fair respect of sovereignty,"
3679,And made his majesty the bawd to theirs.
3680,"France is a bawd to Fortune and King John,"
3681,"That strumpet Fortune, that usurping John!"
3682,"Tell me, thou fellow, is not France forsworn?"
3683,"Envenom him with words, or get thee gone,"
3684,And leave those woes alone which I alone
3685,Am bound to underbear.
3686,I may not go without you to the Kings.
3687,"Thou mayst, thou shalt; I will not go with thee."
3688,"I will instruct my sorrows to be proud,"
3689,For grief is proud and makes his owner stoop.
3690,To me and to the state of my great grief
3691,Let kings assemble; for my grief’s so great
3692,That no supporter but the huge firm earth
3693,Can hold it up. Here I and sorrows sit;
3694,"Here is my throne, bid kings come bow to it."
3695,"Enter King John, King Philip, Louis, Blanche, Eleanor, Bastard, Austria"
3696,"’Tis true, fair daughter; and this blessed day"
3697,Ever in France shall be kept festival.
3698,To solemnize this day the glorious sun
3699,"Stays in his course and plays the alchemist,"
3700,Turning with splendour of his precious eye
3701,The meagre cloddy earth to glittering gold.
3702,The yearly course that brings this day about
3703,Shall never see it but a holy day.
3704,What hath this day deserv’d? What hath it done
3705,That it in golden letters should be set
3706,Among the high tides in the calendar?
3707,"Nay, rather turn this day out of the week,"
3708,"This day of shame, oppression, perjury."
3709,"Or, if it must stand still, let wives with child"
3710,"Pray that their burdens may not fall this day,"
3711,Lest that their hopes prodigiously be cross’d.
3712,But on this day let seamen fear no wrack;
3713,No bargains break that are not this day made;
3714,"This day, all things begun come to ill end,"
3715,"Yea, faith itself to hollow falsehood change!"
3716,"By heaven, lady, you shall have no cause"
3717,To curse the fair proceedings of this day.
3718,Have I not pawn’d to you my majesty?
3719,You have beguil’d me with a counterfeit
3720,"Resembling majesty, which, being touch’d and tried,"
3721,"Proves valueless. You are forsworn, forsworn."
3722,"You came in arms to spill mine enemies’ blood,"
3723,But now in arms you strengthen it with yours.
3724,The grappling vigour and rough frown of war
3725,"Is cold in amity and painted peace,"
3726,And our oppression hath made up this league.
3727,"Arm, arm, you heavens, against these perjur’d kings!"
3728,"A widow cries; be husband to me, heavens!"
3729,Let not the hours of this ungodly day
3730,"Wear out the day in peace; but, ere sunset,"
3731,Set armed discord ’twixt these perjur’d kings!
3732,"Hear me, O, hear me!"
3733,War! war! no peace! Peace is to me a war.
3734,"O Limoges, O Austria, thou dost shame"
3735,"That bloody spoil. Thou slave, thou wretch, thou coward!"
3736,"Thou little valiant, great in villainy!"
3737,Thou ever strong upon the stronger side!
3738,Thou Fortune’s champion that dost never fight
3739,But when her humorous ladyship is by
3740,"To teach thee safety! Thou art perjur’d too,"
3741,"And sooth’st up greatness. What a fool art thou,"
3742,"A ramping fool, to brag, and stamp, and swear"
3743,"Upon my party! Thou cold-blooded slave,"
3744,Hast thou not spoke like thunder on my side?
3745,"Been sworn my soldier, bidding me depend"
3746,"Upon thy stars, thy fortune, and thy strength?"
3747,And dost thou now fall over to my foes?
3748,"Thou wear a lion’s hide! Doff it for shame,"
3749,And hang a calf’s-skin on those recreant limbs.
3750,O that a man should speak those words to me!
3751,And hang a calf’s-skin on those recreant limbs.
3752,"Thou dar’st not say so, villain, for thy life."
3753,And hang a calf’s-skin on those recreant limbs.
3754,We like not this. Thou dost forget thyself.
3755,Here comes the holy legate of the Pope.
3756,"Hail, you anointed deputies of heaven!"
3757,"To thee, King John, my holy errand is."
3758,"I Pandulph, of fair Milan cardinal,"
3759,"And from Pope Innocent the legate here,"
3760,Do in his name religiously demand
3761,"Why thou against the church, our holy mother,"
3762,So wilfully dost spurn; and force perforce
3763,"Keep Stephen Langton, chosen Archbishop"
3764,"Of Canterbury, from that holy see."
3765,"This, in our foresaid holy father’s name,"
3766,"Pope Innocent, I do demand of thee."
3767,What earthy name to interrogatories
3768,Can task the free breath of a sacred king?
3769,"Thou canst not, cardinal, devise a name"
3770,"So slight, unworthy, and ridiculous,"
3771,"To charge me to an answer, as the pope."
3772,Tell him this tale; and from the mouth of England
3773,"Add thus much more, that no Italian priest"
3774,Shall tithe or toll in our dominions;
3775,"But as we under God are supreme head,"
3776,"So, under Him, that great supremacy,"
3777,"Where we do reign, we will alone uphold"
3778,Without th’ assistance of a mortal hand.
3779,"So tell the pope, all reverence set apart"
3780,To him and his usurp’d authority.
3781,"Brother of England, you blaspheme in this."
3782,Though you and all the kings of Christendom
3783,"Are led so grossly by this meddling priest,"
3784,Dreading the curse that money may buy out;
3785,"And by the merit of vile gold, dross, dust,"
3786,"Purchase corrupted pardon of a man,"
3787,Who in that sale sells pardon from himself;
3788,"Though you and all the rest, so grossly led,"
3789,"This juggling witchcraft with revenue cherish,"
3790,"Yet I alone, alone do me oppose"
3791,"Against the pope, and count his friends my foes."
3792,"Then, by the lawful power that I have,"
3793,Thou shalt stand curs’d and excommunicate;
3794,And blessed shall he be that doth revolt
3795,From his allegiance to an heretic;
3796,"And meritorious shall that hand be call’d,"
3797,"Canonized and worshipp’d as a saint,"
3798,That takes away by any secret course
3799,"O, lawful let it be"
3800,That I have room with Rome to curse awhile!
3801,"Good father Cardinal, cry thou amen"
3802,To my keen curses; for without my wrong
3803,There is no tongue hath power to curse him right.
3804,"There’s law and warrant, lady, for my curse."
3805,"And for mine too. When law can do no right,"
3806,Let it be lawful that law bar no wrong.
3807,"Law cannot give my child his kingdom here,"
3808,For he that holds his kingdom holds the law;
3809,"Therefore, since law itself is perfect wrong,"
3810,How can the law forbid my tongue to curse?
3811,"Philip of France, on peril of a curse,"
3812,"Let go the hand of that arch-heretic,"
3813,"And raise the power of France upon his head,"
3814,Unless he do submit himself to Rome.
3815,"Look’st thou pale, France? Do not let go thy hand."
3816,"Look to that, devil, lest that France repent"
3817,"And by disjoining hands, hell lose a soul."
3818,"King Philip, listen to the cardinal."
3819,And hang a calf’s-skin on his recreant limbs.
3820,"Well, ruffian, I must pocket up these wrongs,"
3821,Your breeches best may carry them.
3822,"Philip, what say’st thou to the cardinal?"
3823,"What should he say, but as the cardinal?"
3824,"Bethink you, father; for the difference"
3825,"Is purchase of a heavy curse from Rome,"
3826,Or the light loss of England for a friend.
3827,That’s the curse of Rome.
3828,"O Louis, stand fast! The devil tempts thee here"
3829,In likeness of a new untrimmed bride.
3830,"The Lady Constance speaks not from her faith,"
3831,But from her need.
3832,"O, if thou grant my need,"
3833,"Which only lives but by the death of faith,"
3834,That need must needs infer this principle:
3835,That faith would live again by death of need.
3836,"O then tread down my need, and faith mounts up;"
3837,"Keep my need up, and faith is trodden down!"
3838,"The King is mov’d, and answers not to this."
3839,"O, be remov’d from him, and answer well!"
3840,"Do so, King Philip; hang no more in doubt."
3841,"Hang nothing but a calf’s-skin, most sweet lout."
3842,"I am perplex’d, and know not what to say."
3843,"What canst thou say but will perplex thee more,"
3844,If thou stand excommunicate and curs’d?
3845,"Good reverend father, make my person yours,"
3846,And tell me how you would bestow yourself.
3847,"This royal hand and mine are newly knit,"
3848,And the conjunction of our inward souls
3849,"Married in league, coupled and link’d together"
3850,With all religious strength of sacred vows;
3851,The latest breath that gave the sound of words
3852,"Was deep-sworn faith, peace, amity, true love"
3853,Between our kingdoms and our royal selves;
3854,"And even before this truce, but new before,"
3855,No longer than we well could wash our hands
3856,"To clap this royal bargain up of peace,"
3857,"Heaven knows, they were besmear’d and overstain’d"
3858,"With slaughter’s pencil, where revenge did paint"
3859,The fearful difference of incensed kings.
3860,"And shall these hands, so lately purg’d of blood,"
3861,"So newly join’d in love, so strong in both,"
3862,Unyoke this seizure and this kind regreet?
3863,"Play fast and loose with faith? So jest with heaven,"
3864,"Make such unconstant children of ourselves,"
3865,"As now again to snatch our palm from palm,"
3866,"Unswear faith sworn, and on the marriage-bed"
3867,"Of smiling peace to march a bloody host,"
3868,And make a riot on the gentle brow
3869,"Of true sincerity? O, holy sir,"
3870,"My reverend father, let it not be so!"
3871,"Out of your grace, devise, ordain, impose"
3872,"Some gentle order, and then we shall be blest"
3873,To do your pleasure and continue friends.
3874,"All form is formless, order orderless,"
3875,Save what is opposite to England’s love.
3876,"Therefore to arms! Be champion of our church,"
3877,"Or let the church, our mother, breathe her curse,"
3878,"A mother’s curse, on her revolting son."
3879,"France, thou mayst hold a serpent by the tongue,"
3880,"A chafed lion by the mortal paw,"
3881,"A fasting tiger safer by the tooth,"
3882,Than keep in peace that hand which thou dost hold.
3883,"I may disjoin my hand, but not my faith."
3884,"So mak’st thou faith an enemy to faith,"
3885,"And like a civil war sett’st oath to oath,"
3886,"Thy tongue against thy tongue. O, let thy vow"
3887,"First made to heaven, first be to heaven perform’d,"
3888,"That is, to be the champion of our church."
3889,What since thou swor’st is sworn against thyself
3890,"And may not be performed by thyself,"
3891,For that which thou hast sworn to do amiss
3892,Is not amiss when it is truly done;
3893,"And being not done, where doing tends to ill,"
3894,The truth is then most done not doing it.
3895,The better act of purposes mistook
3896,"Is to mistake again; though indirect,"
3897,"Yet indirection thereby grows direct,"
3898,"And falsehood falsehood cures, as fire cools fire"
3899,Within the scorched veins of one new-burn’d.
3900,"It is religion that doth make vows kept,"
3901,But thou hast sworn against religion
3902,"By what thou swear’st against the thing thou swear’st,"
3903,And mak’st an oath the surety for thy truth
3904,Against an oath. The truth thou art unsure
3905,"To swear, swears only not to be forsworn,"
3906,Else what a mockery should it be to swear?
3907,"But thou dost swear only to be forsworn,"
3908,"And most forsworn, to keep what thou dost swear."
3909,Therefore thy latter vows against thy first
3910,Is in thyself rebellion to thyself;
3911,And better conquest never canst thou make
3912,Than arm thy constant and thy nobler parts
3913,"Against these giddy loose suggestions,"
3914,"Upon which better part our prayers come in,"
3915,"If thou vouchsafe them. But if not, then know"
3916,"The peril of our curses light on thee,"
3917,"So heavy as thou shalt not shake them off,"
3918,But in despair die under the black weight.
3919,Will not a calf’s-skin stop that mouth of thine?
3920,Against the blood that thou hast married?
3921,"What, shall our feast be kept with slaughter’d men?"
3922,"Shall braying trumpets and loud churlish drums,"
3923,"Clamours of hell, be measures to our pomp?"
3924,"O husband, hear me! Ay, alack, how new"
3925,"Is “husband” in my mouth! Even for that name,"
3926,"Which till this time my tongue did ne’er pronounce,"
3927,"Upon my knee I beg, go not to arms"
3928,"O, upon my knee,"
3929,"Made hard with kneeling, I do pray to thee,"
3930,"Thou virtuous Dauphin, alter not the doom"
3931,Now shall I see thy love. What motive may
3932,Be stronger with thee than the name of wife?
3933,"That which upholdeth him that thee upholds,"
3934,"His honour. O, thine honour, Louis, thine honour!"
3935,"I muse your majesty doth seem so cold,"
3936,When such profound respects do pull you on.
3937,I will denounce a curse upon his head.
3938,"Thou shalt not need. England, I will fall from thee."
3939,O fair return of banish’d majesty!
3940,O foul revolt of French inconstancy!
3941,"France, thou shalt rue this hour within this hour."
3942,"Old Time the clock-setter, that bald sexton Time,"
3943,"Is it as he will? Well, then, France shall rue."
3944,"The sun’s o’ercast with blood. Fair day, adieu!"
3945,Which is the side that I must go withal?
3946,"I am with both, each army hath a hand;"
3947,"And in their rage, I having hold of both,"
3948,They whirl asunder and dismember me.
3949,"Husband, I cannot pray that thou mayst win;"
3950,"Uncle, I needs must pray that thou mayst lose;"
3951,"Father, I may not wish the fortune thine;"
3952,"Grandam, I will not wish thy wishes thrive."
3953,"Whoever wins, on that side shall I lose;"
3954,Assured loss before the match be play’d.
3955,"Lady, with me, with me thy fortune lies."
3956,"There where my fortune lives, there my life dies."
3957,"Cousin, go draw our puissance together."
3958,"France, I am burn’d up with inflaming wrath;"
3959,"A rage whose heat hath this condition,"
3960,"That nothing can allay, nothing but blood,"
3961,"The blood, and dearest-valu’d blood, of France."
3962,"Thy rage shall burn thee up, and thou shalt turn"
3963,"To ashes, ere our blood shall quench that fire."
3964,"Look to thyself, thou art in jeopardy."
3965,No more than he that threats. To arms let’s hie!
3966,SCENE II. The same. Plains near Angiers
3967,Alarums. Excursions. Enter the Bastard with Austria’s head.
3968,"Now, by my life, this day grows wondrous hot;"
3969,Some airy devil hovers in the sky
3970,"And pours down mischief. Austria’s head lie there,"
3971,"Enter King John, Arthur and Hubert."
3972,"Hubert, keep this boy.—Philip, make up."
3973,"My mother is assailed in our tent,"
3974,"And ta’en, I fear."
3975,"My lord, I rescu’d her;"
3976,"Her highness is in safety, fear you not."
3977,"But on, my liege; for very little pains"
3978,Will bring this labour to an happy end.
3979,SCENE III. The same.
3980,"Alarums, Excursions, Retreat. Enter King John, Eleanor, Arthur, the"
3981,"Bastard, Hubert and Lords."
3982,"Thy grandam loves thee, and thy uncle will"
3983,As dear be to thee as thy father was.
3984,"O, this will make my mother die with grief!"
3985,"And, ere our coming, see thou shake the bags"
3986,Of hoarding abbots; imprison’d angels
3987,Set at liberty. The fat ribs of peace
3988,Must by the hungry now be fed upon.
3989,Use our commission in his utmost force.
3990,"Bell, book, and candle shall not drive me back"
3991,When gold and silver becks me to come on.
3992,"I leave your highness. Grandam, I will pray,"
3993,"If ever I remember to be holy,"
3994,"For your fair safety; so, I kiss your hand."
3995,"Come hither, little kinsman; hark, a word."
3996,"Come hither, Hubert. O my gentle Hubert,"
3997,We owe thee much! Within this wall of flesh
3998,"There is a soul counts thee her creditor,"
3999,And with advantage means to pay thy love.
4000,"And, my good friend, thy voluntary oath"
4001,"Lives in this bosom, dearly cherished."
4002,"Give me thy hand. I had a thing to say,"
4003,But I will fit it with some better tune.
4004,"By heaven, Hubert, I am almost asham’d"
4005,To say what good respect I have of thee.
4006,I am much bounden to your majesty.
4007,"Good friend, thou hast no cause to say so yet,"
4008,"But thou shalt have; and creep time ne’er so slow,"
4009,Yet it shall come for me to do thee good.
4010,"I had a thing to say, but let it go."
4011,"The sun is in the heaven, and the proud day,"
4012,"Attended with the pleasures of the world,"
4013,Is all too wanton and too full of gauds
4014,To give me audience. If the midnight bell
4015,"Did, with his iron tongue and brazen mouth,"
4016,Sound on into the drowsy race of night;
4017,"If this same were a churchyard where we stand,"
4018,And thou possessed with a thousand wrongs;
4019,"Or if that surly spirit, melancholy,"
4020,"Had bak’d thy blood and made it heavy, thick,"
4021,"Which else runs tickling up and down the veins,"
4022,"Making that idiot, laughter, keep men’s eyes"
4023,"And strain their cheeks to idle merriment,"
4024,A passion hateful to my purposes;
4025,"Or if that thou couldst see me without eyes,"
4026,"Hear me without thine ears, and make reply"
4027,"Without a tongue, using conceit alone,"
4028,"Without eyes, ears, and harmful sound of words;"
4029,"Then, in despite of brooded watchful day,"
4030,I would into thy bosom pour my thoughts.
4031,"But, ah, I will not! Yet I love thee well;"
4032,"And, by my troth, I think thou lov’st me well."
4033,"So well that what you bid me undertake,"
4034,"Though that my death were adjunct to my act,"
4035,"By heaven, I would do it."
4036,Do not I know thou wouldst?
4037,"Good Hubert, Hubert, Hubert, throw thine eye"
4038,"On yon young boy. I’ll tell thee what, my friend,"
4039,He is a very serpent in my way;
4040,"And wheresoe’er this foot of mine doth tread,"
4041,He lies before me. Dost thou understand me?
4042,Thou art his keeper.
4043,And I’ll keep him so
4044,That he shall not offend your majesty.
4045,He shall not live.
4046,"I could be merry now. Hubert, I love thee."
4047,"Well, I’ll not say what I intend for thee."
4048,"Remember. Madam, fare you well."
4049,I’ll send those powers o’er to your majesty.
4050,My blessing go with thee!
4051,"For England, cousin, go."
4052,"Hubert shall be your man, attend on you"
4053,"With all true duty. On toward Calais, ho!"
4054,SCENE IV. The same. The French King’s tent.
4055,"Enter King Philip, Louis, Pandulph and Attendants."
4056,"So, by a roaring tempest on the flood"
4057,A whole armado of convicted sail
4058,Is scattered and disjoin’d from fellowship.
4059,Courage and comfort! All shall yet go well.
4060,"What can go well, when we have run so ill."
4061,Are we not beaten? Is not Angiers lost?
4062,Arthur ta’en prisoner? Divers dear friends slain?
4063,"And bloody England into England gone,"
4064,"O’erbearing interruption, spite of France?"
4065,"What he hath won, that hath he fortified."
4066,"So hot a speed with such advice dispos’d,"
4067,"Such temperate order in so fierce a cause,"
4068,Doth want example. Who hath read or heard
4069,Of any kindred action like to this?
4070,"Well could I bear that England had this praise,"
4071,So we could find some pattern of our shame.
4072,Look who comes here! A grave unto a soul;
4073,"Holding th’ eternal spirit, against her will,"
4074,In the vile prison of afflicted breath.
4075,"I prithee, lady, go away with me."
4076,"Lo, now, now see the issue of your peace!"
4077,"Patience, good lady! Comfort, gentle Constance!"
4078,"No, I defy all counsel, all redress,"
4079,"But that which ends all counsel, true redress,"
4080,"Death, death, O amiable, lovely death!"
4081,"Thou odoriferous stench, sound rottenness!"
4082,"Arise forth from the couch of lasting night,"
4083,"Thou hate and terror to prosperity,"
4084,And I will kiss thy detestable bones
4085,"And put my eyeballs in thy vaulty brows,"
4086,"And ring these fingers with thy household worms,"
4087,"And stop this gap of breath with fulsome dust,"
4088,And be a carrion monster like thyself.
4089,"Come, grin on me, and I will think thou smil’st,"
4090,"And buss thee as thy wife. Misery’s love,"
4091,"O, come to me!"
4092,"O fair affliction, peace!"
4093,"No, no, I will not, having breath to cry."
4094,"O, that my tongue were in the thunder’s mouth!"
4095,Then with a passion would I shake the world;
4096,And rouse from sleep that fell anatomy
4097,"Which cannot hear a lady’s feeble voice,"
4098,Which scorns a modern invocation.
4099,"Lady, you utter madness, and not sorrow."
4100,Thou art not holy to belie me so.
4101,I am not mad. This hair I tear is mine;
4102,My name is Constance; I was Geoffrey’s wife;
4103,"Young Arthur is my son, and he is lost."
4104,I am not mad; I would to heaven I were!
4105,For then ’tis like I should forget myself.
4106,"O, if I could, what grief should I forget!"
4107,"Preach some philosophy to make me mad,"
4108,"And thou shalt be canoniz’d, cardinal;"
4109,"For, being not mad but sensible of grief,"
4110,My reasonable part produces reason
4111,"How I may be deliver’d of these woes,"
4112,And teaches me to kill or hang myself.
4113,"If I were mad, I should forget my son,"
4114,Or madly think a babe of clouts were he.
4115,"I am not mad; too well, too well I feel"
4116,The different plague of each calamity.
4117,"Bind up those tresses. O, what love I note"
4118,In the fair multitude of those her hairs!
4119,"Where but by a chance a silver drop hath fall’n,"
4120,Even to that drop ten thousand wiry friends
4121,"Do glue themselves in sociable grief,"
4122,"Like true, inseparable, faithful loves,"
4123,Sticking together in calamity.
4124,"To England, if you will."
4125,Bind up your hairs.
4126,"Yes, that I will; and wherefore will I do it?"
4127,"I tore them from their bonds and cried aloud,"
4128,"“O that these hands could so redeem my son,"
4129,As they have given these hairs their liberty!”
4130,"But now I envy at their liberty,"
4131,"And will again commit them to their bonds,"
4132,Because my poor child is a prisoner.
4133,"And, father cardinal, I have heard you say"
4134,That we shall see and know our friends in heaven.
4135,"If that be true, I shall see my boy again;"
4136,"For since the birth of Cain, the first male child,"
4137,"To him that did but yesterday suspire,"
4138,There was not such a gracious creature born.
4139,But now will canker sorrow eat my bud
4140,"And chase the native beauty from his cheek,"
4141,"And he will look as hollow as a ghost,"
4142,"As dim and meagre as an ague’s fit,"
4143,"And so he’ll die; and, rising so again,"
4144,When I shall meet him in the court of heaven
4145,"I shall not know him. Therefore never, never"
4146,Must I behold my pretty Arthur more.
4147,You hold too heinous a respect of grief.
4148,He talks to me that never had a son.
4149,You are as fond of grief as of your child.
4150,"Grief fills the room up of my absent child,"
4151,"Lies in his bed, walks up and down with me,"
4152,"Puts on his pretty looks, repeats his words,"
4153,"Remembers me of all his gracious parts,"
4154,Stuffs out his vacant garments with his form;
4155,Then have I reason to be fond of grief?
4156,"Fare you well. Had you such a loss as I,"
4157,I could give better comfort than you do.
4158,"I will not keep this form upon my head,"
4159,When there is such disorder in my wit.
4160,"O Lord! My boy, my Arthur, my fair son!"
4161,"My life, my joy, my food, my all the world!"
4162,"My widow-comfort, and my sorrows’ cure!"
4163,"I fear some outrage, and I’ll follow her."
4164,There’s nothing in this world can make me joy.
4165,Life is as tedious as a twice-told tale
4166,Vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man;
4167,"And bitter shame hath spoil’d the sweet world’s taste,"
4168,That it yields nought but shame and bitterness.
4169,"Before the curing of a strong disease,"
4170,"Even in the instant of repair and health,"
4171,The fit is strongest; evils that take leave
4172,On their departure most of all show evil.
4173,What have you lost by losing of this day?
4174,"All days of glory, joy, and happiness."
4175,"If you had won it, certainly you had."
4176,"No, no; when Fortune means to men most good,"
4177,She looks upon them with a threat’ning eye.
4178,’Tis strange to think how much King John hath lost
4179,In this which he accounts so clearly won.
4180,Are not you griev’d that Arthur is his prisoner?
4181,As heartily as he is glad he hath him.
4182,Your mind is all as youthful as your blood.
4183,Now hear me speak with a prophetic spirit;
4184,For even the breath of what I mean to speak
4185,"Shall blow each dust, each straw, each little rub,"
4186,Out of the path which shall directly lead
4187,Thy foot to England’s throne; and therefore mark.
4188,John hath seiz’d Arthur; and it cannot be
4189,"That, whiles warm life plays in that infant’s veins,"
4190,"The misplac’d John should entertain an hour,"
4191,"One minute, nay, one quiet breath of rest."
4192,A sceptre snatch’d with an unruly hand
4193,Must be boisterously maintain’d as gain’d.
4194,And he that stands upon a slipp’ry place
4195,Makes nice of no vile hold to stay him up.
4196,"That John may stand, then, Arthur needs must fall."
4197,"So be it, for it cannot be but so."
4198,But what shall I gain by young Arthur’s fall?
4199,"You, in the right of Lady Blanche your wife,"
4200,May then make all the claim that Arthur did.
4201,"And lose it, life and all, as Arthur did."
4202,How green you are and fresh in this old world!
4203,John lays you plots; the times conspire with you;
4204,For he that steeps his safety in true blood
4205,Shall find but bloody safety and untrue.
4206,This act so evilly borne shall cool the hearts
4207,"Of all his people, and freeze up their zeal,"
4208,That none so small advantage shall step forth
4209,"To check his reign, but they will cherish it;"
4210,"No natural exhalation in the sky,"
4211,"No scope of nature, no distemper’d day,"
4212,"No common wind, no customed event,"
4213,But they will pluck away his natural cause
4214,"And call them meteors, prodigies, and signs,"
4215,"Abortives, presages, and tongues of heaven,"
4216,Plainly denouncing vengeance upon John.
4217,"Maybe he will not touch young Arthur’s life,"
4218,But hold himself safe in his prisonment.
4219,"O, sir, when he shall hear of your approach,"
4220,"If that young Arthur be not gone already,"
4221,Even at that news he dies; and then the hearts
4222,"Of all his people shall revolt from him,"
4223,"And kiss the lips of unacquainted change,"
4224,And pick strong matter of revolt and wrath
4225,Out of the bloody fingers’ ends of John.
4226,Methinks I see this hurly all on foot;
4227,"And, O, what better matter breeds for you"
4228,Than I have nam’d! The bastard Faulconbridge
4229,"Is now in England ransacking the church,"
4230,Offending charity. If but a dozen French
4231,"Were there in arms, they would be as a call"
4232,"To train ten thousand English to their side,"
4233,"Or as a little snow, tumbled about,"
4234,"Anon becomes a mountain. O noble Dauphin,"
4235,Go with me to the King. ’Tis wonderful
4236,"What may be wrought out of their discontent,"
4237,Now that their souls are topful of offence.
4238,For England go. I will whet on the King.
4239,Strong reasons makes strong actions. Let us go.
4240,"If you say ay, the King will not say no."
4241,SCENE I. Northampton. A Room in the Castle.
4242,Enter Hubert and two Executioners.
4243,Heat me these irons hot; and look thou stand
4244,Within the arras. When I strike my foot
4245,"Upon the bosom of the ground, rush forth"
4246,And bind the boy which you shall find with me
4247,"Fast to the chair. Be heedful. Hence, and watch."
4248,I hope your warrant will bear out the deed.
4249,Uncleanly scruples! Fear not you; look to’t.
4250,"Young lad, come forth; I have to say with you."
4251,"Good morrow, little prince."
4252,"As little prince, having so great a title"
4253,"To be more prince, as may be. You are sad."
4254,"Indeed, I have been merrier."
4255,Methinks nobody should be sad but I.
4256,"Yet, I remember, when I was in France,"
4257,"Young gentlemen would be as sad as night,"
4258,"Only for wantonness. By my christendom,"
4259,"So I were out of prison, and kept sheep,"
4260,I should be as merry as the day is long;
4261,"And so I would be here, but that I doubt"
4262,My uncle practises more harm to me.
4263,"He is afraid of me, and I of him."
4264,Is it my fault that I was Geoffrey’s son?
4265,"No, indeed, is’t not; and I would to heaven"
4266,"I were your son, so you would love me, Hubert."
4267,"He will awake my mercy, which lies dead."
4268,Therefore I will be sudden and dispatch.
4269,"Are you sick, Hubert? You look pale today."
4270,"In sooth, I would you were a little sick,"
4271,That I might sit all night and watch with you.
4272,I warrant I love you more than you do me.
4273,"Read here, young Arthur."
4274,Turning dispiteous torture out of door!
4275,"I must be brief, lest resolution drop"
4276,Out at mine eyes in tender womanish tears.—
4277,Can you not read it? Is it not fair writ?
4278,"Too fairly, Hubert, for so foul effect."
4279,Must you with hot irons burn out both mine eyes?
4280,"Young boy, I must."
4281,"Have you the heart? When your head did but ache,"
4282,"I knit my handkercher about your brows,"
4283,"The best I had, a princess wrought it me,"
4284,And I did never ask it you again;
4285,"And with my hand at midnight held your head,"
4286,"And, like the watchful minutes to the hour,"
4287,"Still and anon cheer’d up the heavy time,"
4288,Saying ’What lack you?” and “Where lies your grief?”
4289,Or “What good love may I perform for you?”
4290,Many a poor man’s son would have lien still
4291,And ne’er have spoke a loving word to you;
4292,But you at your sick service had a prince.
4293,"Nay, you may think my love was crafty love,"
4294,"And call it cunning. Do, an if you will."
4295,"If heaven be pleas’d that you must use me ill,"
4296,Why then you must. Will you put out mine eyes?
4297,These eyes that never did nor never shall
4298,So much as frown on you?
4299,I have sworn to do it.
4300,And with hot irons must I burn them out.
4301,"Ah, none but in this iron age would do it!"
4302,"The iron of itself, though heat red-hot,"
4303,Approaching near these eyes would drink my tears
4304,And quench his fiery indignation
4305,Even in the matter of mine innocence;
4306,"Nay, after that, consume away in rust,"
4307,But for containing fire to harm mine eye.
4308,Are you more stubborn-hard than hammer’d iron?
4309,An if an angel should have come to me
4310,"And told me Hubert should put out mine eyes,"
4311,I would not have believ’d him. No tongue but Hubert’s.
4312,"Enter Executioners with cords, irons, &c."
4313,Do as I bid you do.
4314,"O, save me, Hubert, save me! My eyes are out"
4315,Even with the fierce looks of these bloody men.
4316,"Give me the iron, I say, and bind him here."
4317,"Alas, what need you be so boist’rous-rough?"
4318,"I will not struggle, I will stand stone-still."
4319,"For heaven sake, Hubert, let me not be bound!"
4320,"Nay, hear me, Hubert! Drive these men away,"
4321,And I will sit as quiet as a lamb;
4322,"I will not stir, nor wince, nor speak a word,"
4323,Nor look upon the iron angerly.
4324,"Thrust but these men away, and I’ll forgive you,"
4325,Whatever torment you do put me to.
4326,"Go, stand within; let me alone with him."
4327,I am best pleas’d to be from such a deed.
4328,"Alas, I then have chid away my friend!"
4329,He hath a stern look but a gentle heart.
4330,"Let him come back, that his compassion may"
4331,Give life to yours.
4332,"Come, boy, prepare yourself."
4333,Is there no remedy?
4334,"None, but to lose your eyes."
4335,"O heaven, that there were but a mote in yours,"
4336,"A grain, a dust, a gnat, a wandering hair,"
4337,Any annoyance in that precious sense!
4338,"Then, feeling what small things are boisterous there,"
4339,Your vile intent must needs seem horrible.
4340,"Is this your promise? Go to, hold your tongue."
4341,"Hubert, the utterance of a brace of tongues"
4342,Must needs want pleading for a pair of eyes.
4343,"Let me not hold my tongue. Let me not, Hubert,"
4344,"Or, Hubert, if you will, cut out my tongue,"
4345,"So I may keep mine eyes. O, spare mine eyes,"
4346,Though to no use but still to look on you!
4347,"Lo, by my troth, the instrument is cold"
4348,And would not harm me.
4349,"I can heat it, boy."
4350,"No, in good sooth; the fire is dead with grief,"
4351,"Being create for comfort, to be us’d"
4352,In undeserv’d extremes. See else yourself.
4353,There is no malice in this burning coal;
4354,The breath of heaven hath blown his spirit out
4355,And strew’d repentant ashes on his head.
4356,"But with my breath I can revive it, boy."
4357,"An if you do, you will but make it blush"
4358,"And glow with shame of your proceedings, Hubert."
4359,"Nay, it perchance will sparkle in your eyes;"
4360,"And, like a dog that is compell’d to fight,"
4361,Snatch at his master that doth tarre him on.
4362,All things that you should use to do me wrong
4363,Deny their office. Only you do lack
4364,"That mercy which fierce fire and iron extends,"
4365,Creatures of note for mercy-lacking uses.
4366,"Well, see to live; I will not touch thine eye"
4367,For all the treasure that thine uncle owes.
4368,"Yet I am sworn, and I did purpose, boy,"
4369,With this same very iron to burn them out.
4370,"O, now you look like Hubert! All this while"
4371,Peace; no more. Adieu.
4372,Your uncle must not know but you are dead.
4373,I’ll fill these dogged spies with false reports.
4374,"And, pretty child, sleep doubtless and secure"
4375,"That Hubert, for the wealth of all the world,"
4376,Will not offend thee.
4377,"O heaven! I thank you, Hubert."
4378,Silence; no more. Go closely in with me.
4379,Much danger do I undergo for thee.
4380,SCENE II. The same. A Room of State in the Palace.
4381,"Enter King John, crowned, Pembroke, Salisbury and other Lords. The King"
4382,"Here once again we sit, once again crown’d,"
4383,"And look’d upon, I hope, with cheerful eyes."
4384,"This “once again,” but that your highness pleas’d,"
4385,"Was once superfluous. You were crown’d before,"
4386,"And that high royalty was ne’er pluck’d off,"
4387,The faiths of men ne’er stained with revolt;
4388,Fresh expectation troubled not the land
4389,With any long’d-for change or better state.
4390,"Therefore, to be possess’d with double pomp,"
4391,"To guard a title that was rich before,"
4392,"To gild refined gold, to paint the lily,"
4393,"To throw a perfume on the violet,"
4394,"To smooth the ice, or add another hue"
4395,"Unto the rainbow, or with taper-light"
4396,"To seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish,"
4397,Is wasteful and ridiculous excess.
4398,"But that your royal pleasure must be done,"
4399,"This act is as an ancient tale new told,"
4400,"And, in the last repeating, troublesome,"
4401,Being urged at a time unseasonable.
4402,In this the antique and well-noted face
4403,Of plain old form is much disfigured;
4404,"And, like a shifted wind unto a sail,"
4405,"It makes the course of thoughts to fetch about,"
4406,"Startles and frights consideration,"
4407,"Makes sound opinion sick and truth suspected,"
4408,For putting on so new a fashion’d robe.
4409,"When workmen strive to do better than well,"
4410,They do confound their skill in covetousness;
4411,And oftentimes excusing of a fault
4412,"Doth make the fault the worse by the excuse,"
4413,As patches set upon a little breach
4414,Discredit more in hiding of the fault
4415,Than did the fault before it was so patch’d.
4416,"To this effect, before you were new-crown’d,"
4417,We breath’d our counsel; but it pleas’d your highness
4418,"To overbear it, and we are all well pleas’d,"
4419,Since all and every part of what we would
4420,Doth make a stand at what your highness will.
4421,Some reasons of this double coronation
4422,"I have possess’d you with, and think them strong;"
4423,"And more, more strong, when lesser is my fear,"
4424,I shall indue you with. Meantime but ask
4425,"What you would have reform’d that is not well,"
4426,And well shall you perceive how willingly
4427,I will both hear and grant you your requests.
4428,"Then I, as one that am the tongue of these,"
4429,"To sound the purposes of all their hearts,"
4430,"Both for myself and them, but, chief of all,"
4431,"Your safety, for the which myself and them"
4432,"Bend their best studies, heartily request"
4433,"Th’ enfranchisement of Arthur, whose restraint"
4434,Doth move the murmuring lips of discontent
4435,To break into this dangerous argument:
4436,"If what in rest you have in right you hold,"
4437,"Why then your fears, which, as they say, attend"
4438,"The steps of wrong, should move you to mew up"
4439,"Your tender kinsman, and to choke his days"
4440,"With barbarous ignorance, and deny his youth"
4441,The rich advantage of good exercise?
4442,That the time’s enemies may not have this
4443,"To grace occasions, let it be our suit"
4444,That you have bid us ask his liberty;
4445,Which for our goods we do no further ask
4446,"Than whereupon our weal, on you depending,"
4447,Counts it your weal he have his liberty.
4448,Let it be so. I do commit his youth
4449,"Hubert, what news with you?"
4450,This is the man should do the bloody deed.
4451,He show’d his warrant to a friend of mine.
4452,The image of a wicked heinous fault
4453,Lives in his eye; that close aspect of his
4454,Doth show the mood of a much troubled breast;
4455,And I do fearfully believe ’tis done
4456,What we so fear’d he had a charge to do.
4457,The colour of the King doth come and go
4458,"Between his purpose and his conscience,"
4459,Like heralds ’twixt two dreadful battles set.
4460,His passion is so ripe it needs must break.
4461,"And when it breaks, I fear will issue thence"
4462,The foul corruption of a sweet child’s death.
4463,We cannot hold mortality’s strong hand.
4464,"Good lords, although my will to give is living,"
4465,The suit which you demand is gone and dead.
4466,He tells us Arthur is deceas’d tonight.
4467,"Indeed, we fear’d his sickness was past cure."
4468,"Indeed, we heard how near his death he was,"
4469,Before the child himself felt he was sick.
4470,This must be answer’d either here or hence.
4471,Why do you bend such solemn brows on me?
4472,Think you I bear the shears of destiny?
4473,Have I commandment on the pulse of life?
4474,It is apparent foul-play; and ’tis shame
4475,That greatness should so grossly offer it.
4476,"So thrive it in your game, and so, farewell."
4477,"Stay yet, Lord Salisbury. I’ll go with thee"
4478,"And find th’ inheritance of this poor child,"
4479,His little kingdom of a forced grave.
4480,That blood which ow’d the breadth of all this isle
4481,Three foot of it doth hold. Bad world the while!
4482,This must not be thus borne; this will break out
4483,"To all our sorrows, and ere long, I doubt."
4484,They burn in indignation. I repent.
4485,"There is no sure foundation set on blood,"
4486,No certain life achiev’d by others’ death.
4487,A fearful eye thou hast. Where is that blood
4488,That I have seen inhabit in those cheeks?
4489,So foul a sky clears not without a storm.
4490,Pour down thy weather: how goes all in France?
4491,From France to England. Never such a power
4492,For any foreign preparation
4493,Was levied in the body of a land.
4494,The copy of your speed is learn’d by them;
4495,"For when you should be told they do prepare,"
4496,The tidings comes that they are all arriv’d.
4497,"O, where hath our intelligence been drunk?"
4498,"Where hath it slept? Where is my mother’s care,"
4499,"That such an army could be drawn in France,"
4500,And she not hear of it?
4501,"My liege, her ear"
4502,Is stopp’d with dust. The first of April died
4503,"Your noble mother; and as I hear, my lord,"
4504,The Lady Constance in a frenzy died
4505,Three days before. But this from rumour’s tongue
4506,I idly heard; if true or false I know not.
4507,"Withhold thy speed, dreadful occasion!"
4508,"O, make a league with me, till I have pleas’d"
4509,My discontented peers! What! Mother dead?
4510,How wildly then walks my estate in France!
4511,Under whose conduct came those powers of France
4512,That thou for truth giv’st out are landed here?
4513,Thou hast made me giddy
4514,With these in tidings.
4515,Enter the Bastard and Peter of Pomfret.
4516,"Now, what says the world"
4517,To your proceedings? Do not seek to stuff
4518,"My head with more ill news, for it is full."
4519,"But if you be afeard to hear the worst,"
4520,"Then let the worst, unheard, fall on your head."
4521,"Bear with me, cousin, for I was amaz’d"
4522,"Under the tide, but now I breathe again"
4523,"Aloft the flood, and can give audience"
4524,"To any tongue, speak it of what it will."
4525,How I have sped among the clergymen
4526,The sums I have collected shall express.
4527,"But as I travaill’d hither through the land,"
4528,I find the people strangely fantasied;
4529,"Possess’d with rumours, full of idle dreams,"
4530,"Not knowing what they fear, but full of fear."
4531,And here’s a prophet that I brought with me
4532,"From forth the streets of Pomfret, whom I found"
4533,With many hundreds treading on his heels;
4534,"To whom he sung, in rude harsh-sounding rhymes,"
4535,"That, ere the next Ascension-day at noon,"
4536,Your highness should deliver up your crown.
4537,"Thou idle dreamer, wherefore didst thou so?"
4538,Foreknowing that the truth will fall out so.
4539,"Hubert, away with him; imprison him."
4540,"And on that day at noon, whereon he says"
4541,"I shall yield up my crown, let him be hang’d."
4542,"Deliver him to safety, and return,"
4543,For I must use thee.
4544,"O my gentle cousin,"
4545,"Hear’st thou the news abroad, who are arriv’d?"
4546,"The French, my lord. Men’s mouths are full of it."
4547,"Besides, I met Lord Bigot and Lord Salisbury,"
4548,"With eyes as red as new-enkindled fire,"
4549,"And others more, going to seek the grave"
4550,"Of Arthur, whom they say is kill’d tonight"
4551,And thrust thyself into their companies.
4552,I have a way to will their loves again.
4553,Bring them before me.
4554,I will seek them out.
4555,"Nay, but make haste, the better foot before!"
4556,"O, let me have no subject enemies"
4557,When adverse foreigners affright my towns
4558,With dreadful pomp of stout invasion!
4559,"Be Mercury, set feathers to thy heels,"
4560,And fly like thought from them to me again.
4561,The spirit of the time shall teach me speed.
4562,Spoke like a sprightful noble gentleman!
4563,Go after him; for he perhaps shall need
4564,Some messenger betwixt me and the peers;
4565,And be thou he.
4566,"With all my heart, my liege."
4567,"My lord, they say five moons were seen tonight—"
4568,"Four fixed, and the fifth did whirl about"
4569,The other four in wondrous motion.
4570,Old men and beldams in the streets
4571,Do prophesy upon it dangerously.
4572,Young Arthur’s death is common in their mouths.
4573,"And when they talk of him, they shake their heads"
4574,And whisper one another in the ear;
4575,"And he that speaks doth gripe the hearer’s wrist,"
4576,Whilst he that hears makes fearful action
4577,"With wrinkled brows, with nods, with rolling eyes."
4578,"I saw a smith stand with his hammer, thus,"
4579,"The whilst his iron did on the anvil cool,"
4580,With open mouth swallowing a tailor’s news;
4581,"Who, with his shears and measure in his hand,"
4582,"Standing on slippers, which his nimble haste"
4583,"Had falsely thrust upon contrary feet,"
4584,Told of a many thousand warlike French
4585,That were embattailed and rank’d in Kent.
4586,Another lean unwash’d artificer
4587,Cuts off his tale and talks of Arthur’s death.
4588,Why seek’st thou to possess me with these fears?
4589,Why urgest thou so oft young Arthur’s death?
4590,Thy hand hath murder’d him. I had a mighty cause
4591,"To wish him dead, but thou hadst none to kill him."
4592,"No had, my lord! Why, did you not provoke me?"
4593,It is the curse of kings to be attended
4594,By slaves that take their humours for a warrant
4595,"To break within the bloody house of life,"
4596,"And, on the winking of authority"
4597,"To understand a law, to know the meaning"
4598,"Of dangerous majesty, when perchance it frowns"
4599,More upon humour than advis’d respect.
4600,Here is your hand and seal for what I did.
4601,"O, when the last account ’twixt heaven and earth"
4602,"Is to be made, then shall this hand and seal"
4603,Witness against us to damnation!
4604,How oft the sight of means to do ill deeds
4605,"Make deeds ill done! Hadst not thou been by,"
4606,"A fellow by the hand of nature mark’d,"
4607,"Quoted and sign’d to do a deed of shame,"
4608,This murder had not come into my mind.
4609,"But taking note of thy abhorr’d aspect,"
4610,"Finding thee fit for bloody villainy,"
4611,"Apt, liable to be employ’d in danger,"
4612,I faintly broke with thee of Arthur’s death;
4613,"And thou, to be endeared to a king,"
4614,Made it no conscience to destroy a prince.
4615,Hadst thou but shook thy head or made pause
4616,"When I spake darkly what I purpos’d,"
4617,"Or turn’d an eye of doubt upon my face,"
4618,"As bid me tell my tale in express words,"
4619,"Deep shame had struck me dumb, made me break off,"
4620,And those thy fears might have wrought fears in me.
4621,But thou didst understand me by my signs
4622,And didst in signs again parley with sin;
4623,"Yea, without stop, didst let thy heart consent,"
4624,And consequently thy rude hand to act
4625,The deed which both our tongues held vile to name.
4626,"Out of my sight, and never see me more!"
4627,"My nobles leave me, and my state is brav’d,"
4628,"Even at my gates, with ranks of foreign powers."
4629,"Nay, in the body of the fleshly land,"
4630,"This kingdom, this confine of blood and breath,"
4631,Hostility and civil tumult reigns
4632,Between my conscience and my cousin’s death.
4633,"Arm you against your other enemies,"
4634,I’ll make a peace between your soul and you.
4635,Young Arthur is alive. This hand of mine
4636,"Is yet a maiden and an innocent hand,"
4637,Not painted with the crimson spots of blood.
4638,Within this bosom never enter’d yet
4639,The dreadful motion of a murderous thought;
4640,"And you have slander’d nature in my form,"
4641,"Which, howsoever rude exteriorly,"
4642,Is yet the cover of a fairer mind
4643,Than to be butcher of an innocent child.
4644,"Doth Arthur live? O, haste thee to the peers,"
4645,"Throw this report on their incensed rage,"
4646,And make them tame to their obedience!
4647,Forgive the comment that my passion made
4648,"Upon thy feature; for my rage was blind,"
4649,And foul imaginary eyes of blood
4650,Presented thee more hideous than thou art.
4651,"O, answer not, but to my closet bring"
4652,The angry lords with all expedient haste.
4653,I conjure thee but slowly; run more fast.
4654,SCENE III. The same. Before the castle.
4655,Enter Arthur on the walls.
4656,"The wall is high, and yet will I leap down."
4657,"Good ground, be pitiful and hurt me not!"
4658,"There’s few or none do know me, If they did,"
4659,This ship-boy’s semblance hath disguis’d me quite.
4660,I am afraid; and yet I’ll venture it.
4661,"If I get down, and do not break my limbs,"
4662,I’ll find a thousand shifts to get away.
4663,"As good to die and go, as die and stay."
4664,"O me, my uncle’s spirit is in these stones."
4665,"Heaven take my soul, and England keep my bones!"
4666,"Enter Pembroke, Salisbury and Bigot."
4667,"Lords, I will meet him at Saint Edmundsbury;"
4668,"It is our safety, and we must embrace"
4669,This gentle offer of the perilous time.
4670,Who brought that letter from the cardinal?
4671,"The Count Melun, a noble lord of France,"
4672,Whose private with me of the Dauphin’s love
4673,Is much more general than these lines import.
4674,Tomorrow morning let us meet him then.
4675,Or rather then set forward; for ’twill be
4676,"Two long days’ journey, lords, or ere we meet."
4677,"Once more today well met, distemper’d lords!"
4678,The King by me requests your presence straight.
4679,The King hath dispossess’d himself of us.
4680,We will not line his thin bestained cloak
4681,"With our pure honours, nor attend the foot"
4682,That leaves the print of blood where’er it walks.
4683,Return and tell him so. We know the worst.
4684,"Whate’er you think, good words, I think, were best."
4685,"Our griefs, and not our manners, reason now."
4686,But there is little reason in your grief;
4687,Therefore ’twere reason you had manners now.
4688,"Sir, sir, impatience hath his privilege."
4689,"’Tis true, to hurt his master, no man’s else."
4690,This is the prison. What is he lies here?
4691,"O death, made proud with pure and princely beauty!"
4692,The earth had not a hole to hide this deed.
4693,"Murder, as hating what himself hath done,"
4694,Doth lay it open to urge on revenge.
4695,"Or, when he doom’d this beauty to a grave,"
4696,Found it too precious-princely for a grave.
4697,"Sir Richard, what think you? Have you beheld,"
4698,"Or have you read or heard, or could you think,"
4699,"Or do you almost think, although you see,"
4700,"That you do see? Could thought, without this object,"
4701,"Form such another? This is the very top,"
4702,"The height, the crest, or crest unto the crest,"
4703,"Of murder’s arms. This is the bloodiest shame,"
4704,"The wildest savagery, the vilest stroke,"
4705,That ever wall-ey’d wrath or staring rage
4706,Presented to the tears of soft remorse.
4707,All murders past do stand excus’d in this.
4708,"And this, so sole and so unmatchable,"
4709,"Shall give a holiness, a purity,"
4710,To the yet unbegotten sin of times;
4711,"And prove a deadly bloodshed but a jest,"
4712,Exampled by this heinous spectacle.
4713,It is a damned and a bloody work;
4714,"The graceless action of a heavy hand,"
4715,If that it be the work of any hand.
4716,If that it be the work of any hand?
4717,We had a kind of light what would ensue.
4718,"It is the shameful work of Hubert’s hand,"
4719,"The practice and the purpose of the King,"
4720,"From whose obedience I forbid my soul,"
4721,"Kneeling before this ruin of sweet life,"
4722,And breathing to his breathless excellence
4723,"The incense of a vow, a holy vow,"
4724,"Never to taste the pleasures of the world,"
4725,"Never to be infected with delight,"
4726,"Nor conversant with ease and idleness,"
4727,"Till I have set a glory to this hand,"
4728,By giving it the worship of revenge.
4729,Our souls religiously confirm thy words.
4730,"Lords, I am hot with haste in seeking you."
4731,Arthur doth live; the King hath sent for you.
4732,"O, he is bold and blushes not at death."
4733,"Avaunt, thou hateful villain, get thee gone!"
4734,I am no villain.
4735,Must I rob the law?
4736,"Your sword is bright, sir; put it up again."
4737,Not till I sheathe it in a murderer’s skin.
4738,"Stand back, Lord Salisbury, stand back, I say;"
4739,"By heaven, I think my sword’s as sharp as yours."
4740,"I would not have you, lord, forget yourself,"
4741,Nor tempt the danger of my true defence;
4742,"Lest I, by marking of your rage, forget"
4743,"Your worth, your greatness, and nobility."
4744,"Out, dunghill! Dar’st thou brave a nobleman?"
4745,Not for my life. But yet I dare defend
4746,My innocent life against an emperor.
4747,Thou art a murderer.
4748,Do not prove me so.
4749,"Yet I am none. Whose tongue soe’er speaks false,"
4750,"Not truly speaks; who speaks not truly, lies."
4751,Cut him to pieces.
4752,"Keep the peace, I say."
4753,"Stand by, or I shall gall you, Faulconbridge."
4754,"Thou wert better gall the devil, Salisbury."
4755,"If thou but frown on me, or stir thy foot,"
4756,"Or teach thy hasty spleen to do me shame,"
4757,"I’ll strike thee dead. Put up thy sword betime,"
4758,Or I’ll so maul you and your toasting-iron
4759,That you shall think the devil is come from hell.
4760,"What wilt thou do, renowned Faulconbridge?"
4761,Second a villain and a murderer?
4762,"Lord Bigot, I am none."
4763,Who kill’d this prince?
4764,’Tis not an hour since I left him well.
4765,"I honour’d him, I lov’d him, and will weep"
4766,My date of life out for his sweet life’s loss.
4767,"Trust not those cunning waters of his eyes,"
4768,For villainy is not without such rheum;
4769,"And he, long traded in it, makes it seem"
4770,Like rivers of remorse and innocency.
4771,"Away with me, all you whose souls abhor"
4772,Th’ uncleanly savours of a slaughterhouse;
4773,For I am stifled with this smell of sin.
4774,"Away toward Bury, to the Dauphin there!"
4775,There tell the King he may inquire us out.
4776,Here’s a good world! Knew you of this fair work?
4777,Beyond the infinite and boundless reach
4778,"Of mercy, if thou didst this deed of death,"
4779,"Art thou damn’d, Hubert."
4780,"Do but hear me, sir."
4781,Ha! I’ll tell thee what;
4782,"Thou’rt damn’d as black—nay, nothing is so black;"
4783,Thou art more deep damn’d than Prince Lucifer.
4784,There is not yet so ugly a fiend of hell
4785,"As thou shalt be, if thou didst kill this child."
4786,If thou didst but consent
4787,"To this most cruel act, do but despair;"
4788,"And if thou want’st a cord, the smallest thread"
4789,That ever spider twisted from her womb
4790,Will serve to strangle thee; a rush will be a beam
4791,"To hang thee on; or wouldst thou drown thyself,"
4792,Put but a little water in a spoon
4793,"And it shall be as all the ocean,"
4794,Enough to stifle such a villain up.
4795,I do suspect thee very grievously.
4796,"If I in act, consent, or sin of thought,"
4797,Be guilty of the stealing that sweet breath
4798,"Which was embounded in this beauteous clay,"
4799,Let hell want pains enough to torture me!
4800,I left him well.
4801,"Go, bear him in thine arms."
4802,"I am amaz’d, methinks, and lose my way"
4803,Among the thorns and dangers of this world.
4804,How easy dost thou take all England up!
4805,"From forth this morsel of dead royalty,"
4806,"The life, the right, and truth of all this realm"
4807,Is fled to heaven; and England now is left
4808,"To tug and scamble, and to part by th’ teeth"
4809,The unow’d interest of proud-swelling state.
4810,Now for the bare-pick’d bone of majesty
4811,Doth dogged war bristle his angry crest
4812,And snarleth in the gentle eyes of peace.
4813,Now powers from home and discontents at home
4814,"Meet in one line; and vast confusion waits,"
4815,"As doth a raven on a sick-fall’n beast,"
4816,The imminent decay of wrested pomp.
4817,Now happy he whose cloak and cincture can
4818,"Hold out this tempest. Bear away that child,"
4819,And follow me with speed. I’ll to the King.
4820,"A thousand businesses are brief in hand,"
4821,And heaven itself doth frown upon the land.
4822,SCENE I. Northampton. A Room in the Palace.
4823,"Enter King John, Pandulph with the crown, and Attendants."
4824,Thus have I yielded up into your hand
4825,The circle of my glory.
4826,"From this my hand, as holding of the pope,"
4827,Your sovereign greatness and authority.
4828,"Now keep your holy word. Go meet the French,"
4829,And from his holiness use all your power
4830,To stop their marches ’fore we are inflam’d.
4831,Our discontented counties do revolt;
4832,"Our people quarrel with obedience,"
4833,Swearing allegiance and the love of soul
4834,"To stranger blood, to foreign royalty."
4835,This inundation of mistemper’d humour
4836,Rests by you only to be qualified.
4837,Then pause not; for the present time’s so sick
4838,That present med’cine must be minist’red
4839,Or overthrow incurable ensues.
4840,"It was my breath that blew this tempest up,"
4841,Upon your stubborn usage of the pope;
4842,"But since you are a gentle convertite,"
4843,My tongue shall hush again this storm of war
4844,And make fair weather in your blust’ring land.
4845,"On this Ascension-day, remember well,"
4846,"Upon your oath of service to the pope,"
4847,Go I to make the French lay down their arms.
4848,Is this Ascension-day? Did not the prophet
4849,Say that before Ascension-day at noon
4850,My crown I should give off? Even so I have.
4851,I did suppose it should be on constraint;
4852,"But, heaven be thank’d, it is but voluntary."
4853,All Kent hath yielded. Nothing there holds out
4854,"But Dover Castle. London hath receiv’d,"
4855,"Like a kind host, the Dauphin and his powers."
4856,"Your nobles will not hear you, but are gone"
4857,To offer service to your enemy;
4858,And wild amazement hurries up and down
4859,The little number of your doubtful friends.
4860,Would not my lords return to me again
4861,After they heard young Arthur was alive?
4862,"They found him dead and cast into the streets,"
4863,"An empty casket, where the jewel of life"
4864,By some damn’d hand was robb’d and ta’en away.
4865,That villain Hubert told me he did live.
4866,"So, on my soul, he did, for aught he knew."
4867,But wherefore do you droop? Why look you sad?
4868,"Be great in act, as you have been in thought;"
4869,Let not the world see fear and sad distrust
4870,Govern the motion of a kingly eye.
4871,Be stirring as the time; be fire with fire;
4872,"Threaten the threat’ner, and outface the brow"
4873,"Of bragging horror. So shall inferior eyes,"
4874,"That borrow their behaviours from the great,"
4875,Grow great by your example and put on
4876,The dauntless spirit of resolution.
4877,"Away, and glister like the god of war"
4878,When he intendeth to become the field.
4879,Show boldness and aspiring confidence.
4880,"What, shall they seek the lion in his den,"
4881,And fright him there? And make him tremble there?
4882,"O, let it not be said! Forage, and run"
4883,"To meet displeasure farther from the doors,"
4884,And grapple with him ere he come so nigh.
4885,"The legate of the pope hath been with me,"
4886,And I have made a happy peace with him;
4887,And he hath promis’d to dismiss the powers
4888,Led by the Dauphin.
4889,"Shall we, upon the footing of our land,"
4890,"Send fair-play orders and make compromise,"
4891,"Insinuation, parley, and base truce"
4892,"To arms invasive? Shall a beardless boy,"
4893,"A cocker’d silken wanton, brave our fields,"
4894,"And flesh his spirit in a warlike soil,"
4895,"Mocking the air with colours idly spread,"
4896,"And find no check? Let us, my liege, to arms!"
4897,Perchance the cardinal cannot make your peace;
4898,"Or if he do, let it at least be said"
4899,They saw we had a purpose of defence.
4900,Have thou the ordering of this present time.
4901,"Away, then, with good courage! Yet, I know"
4902,Our party may well meet a prouder foe.
4903,SCENE II. Near Saint Edmundsbury. The French Camp.
4904,"Enter, in arms, Louis, Salisbury, Melun, Pembroke, Bigot and soldiers."
4905,"My Lord Melun, let this be copied out,"
4906,And keep it safe for our remembrance.
4907,Return the precedent to these lords again;
4908,"That, having our fair order written down,"
4909,"Both they and we, perusing o’er these notes,"
4910,"May know wherefore we took the sacrament,"
4911,And keep our faiths firm and inviolable.
4912,Upon our sides it never shall be broken.
4913,"And, noble Dauphin, albeit we swear"
4914,A voluntary zeal and an unurg’d faith
4915,"To your proceedings; yet believe me, prince,"
4916,I am not glad that such a sore of time
4917,"Should seek a plaster by contemn’d revolt,"
4918,And heal the inveterate canker of one wound
4919,"By making many. O, it grieves my soul"
4920,That I must draw this metal from my side
4921,"To be a widow-maker! O, and there"
4922,Where honourable rescue and defence
4923,Cries out upon the name of Salisbury!
4924,"But such is the infection of the time,"
4925,"That, for the health and physic of our right,"
4926,We cannot deal but with the very hand
4927,Of stern injustice and confused wrong.
4928,"And is’t not pity, O my grieved friends,"
4929,"That we, the sons and children of this isle,"
4930,Were born to see so sad an hour as this;
4931,"Wherein we step after a stranger, march"
4932,"Upon her gentle bosom, and fill up"
4933,Her enemies’ ranks? I must withdraw and weep
4934,"Upon the spot of this enforced cause,"
4935,"To grace the gentry of a land remote,"
4936,And follow unacquainted colours here.
4937,"What, here? O nation, that thou couldst remove!"
4938,"That Neptune’s arms, who clippeth thee about,"
4939,Would bear thee from the knowledge of thyself
4940,"And grapple thee unto a pagan shore,"
4941,Where these two Christian armies might combine
4942,"The blood of malice in a vein of league,"
4943,And not to spend it so unneighbourly!
4944,A noble temper dost thou show in this;
4945,And great affections wrestling in thy bosom
4946,Doth make an earthquake of nobility.
4947,"O, what a noble combat hast thou fought"
4948,Between compulsion and a brave respect!
4949,Let me wipe off this honourable dew
4950,That silverly doth progress on thy cheeks.
4951,"My heart hath melted at a lady’s tears,"
4952,Being an ordinary inundation;
4953,"But this effusion of such manly drops,"
4954,"This shower, blown up by tempest of the soul,"
4955,Startles mine eyes and makes me more amaz’d
4956,Than had I seen the vaulty top of heaven
4957,Figur’d quite o’er with burning meteors.
4958,"Lift up thy brow, renowned Salisbury,"
4959,And with a great heart heave away this storm.
4960,Commend these waters to those baby eyes
4961,"That never saw the giant world enrag’d,"
4962,"Nor met with fortune other than at feasts,"
4963,"Full of warm blood, of mirth, of gossiping."
4964,"Come, come; for thou shalt thrust thy hand as deep"
4965,Into the purse of rich prosperity
4966,"As Louis himself.—So, nobles, shall you all,"
4967,That knit your sinews to the strength of mine.
4968,"And even there, methinks, an angel spake."
4969,"Look, where the holy legate comes apace,"
4970,"To give us warrant from the hand of heaven,"
4971,And on our actions set the name of right
4972,"Hail, noble prince of France!"
4973,The next is this: King John hath reconcil’d
4974,"Himself to Rome; his spirit is come in,"
4975,"That so stood out against the holy church,"
4976,The great metropolis and see of Rome.
4977,"Therefore thy threat’ning colours now wind up,"
4978,"And tame the savage spirit of wild war,"
4979,"That, like a lion foster’d up at hand,"
4980,It may lie gently at the foot of peace
4981,And be no further harmful than in show.
4982,"Your grace shall pardon me, I will not back."
4983,"I am too high-born to be propertied,"
4984,"To be a secondary at control,"
4985,Or useful serving-man and instrument
4986,To any sovereign state throughout the world.
4987,Your breath first kindled the dead coal of wars
4988,"Between this chastis’d kingdom and myself,"
4989,And brought in matter that should feed this fire;
4990,And now ’tis far too huge to be blown out
4991,With that same weak wind which enkindled it.
4992,"You taught me how to know the face of right,"
4993,"Acquainted me with interest to this land,"
4994,"Yea, thrust this enterprise into my heart;"
4995,And come ye now to tell me John hath made
4996,His peace with Rome? What is that peace to me?
4997,"I, by the honour of my marriage-bed,"
4998,"After young Arthur, claim this land for mine;"
4999,"And, now it is half-conquer’d, must I back"
5000,Because that John hath made his peace with Rome?
5001,"Am I Rome’s slave? What penny hath Rome borne,"
5002,"What men provided, what munition sent,"
5003,To underprop this action? Is’t not I
5004,"That undergo this charge? Who else but I,"
5005,"And such as to my claim are liable,"
5006,Sweat in this business and maintain this war?
5007,Have I not heard these islanders shout out
5008,_Vive le Roi!_ as I have bank’d their towns?
5009,Have I not here the best cards for the game
5010,To win this easy match play’d for a crown?
5011,And shall I now give o’er the yielded set?
5012,"No, no, on my soul, it never shall be said."
5013,You look but on the outside of this work.
5014,"Outside or inside, I will not return"
5015,Till my attempt so much be glorified
5016,As to my ample hope was promised
5017,"Before I drew this gallant head of war,"
5018,"And cull’d these fiery spirits from the world,"
5019,To outlook conquest and to win renown
5020,Even in the jaws of danger and of death.
5021,What lusty trumpet thus doth summon us?
5022,"Enter the Bastard, attended."
5023,"According to the fair play of the world,"
5024,"Let me have audience; I am sent to speak,"
5025,"My holy lord of Milan, from the King"
5026,I come to learn how you have dealt for him;
5027,"And, as you answer, I do know the scope"
5028,And warrant limited unto my tongue.
5029,"The Dauphin is too wilful-opposite,"
5030,And will not temporize with my entreaties;
5031,He flatly says he’ll not lay down his arms.
5032,"By all the blood that ever fury breath’d,"
5033,"The youth says well. Now hear our English king,"
5034,For thus his royalty doth speak in me:
5035,"He is prepar’d, and reason too he should."
5036,"This apish and unmannerly approach,"
5037,"This harness’d masque and unadvised revel,"
5038,"This unhair’d sauciness and boyish troops,"
5039,The King doth smile at; and is well prepar’d
5040,"To whip this dwarfish war, these pigmy arms,"
5041,From out the circle of his territories.
5042,"That hand which had the strength, even at your door,"
5043,"To cudgel you and make you take the hatch,"
5044,"To dive like buckets in concealed wells,"
5045,"To crouch in litter of your stable planks,"
5046,"To lie like pawns lock’d up in chests and trunks,"
5047,"To hug with swine, to seek sweet safety out"
5048,"In vaults and prisons, and to thrill and shake"
5049,"Even at the crying of your nation’s crow,"
5050,Thinking this voice an armed Englishman;
5051,Shall that victorious hand be feebled here
5052,That in your chambers gave you chastisement?
5053,No! Know the gallant monarch is in arms
5054,And like an eagle o’er his aery towers
5055,To souse annoyance that comes near his nest.—
5056,"And you degenerate, you ingrate revolts,"
5057,"You bloody Neroes, ripping up the womb"
5058,"Of your dear mother England, blush for shame!"
5059,For your own ladies and pale-visag’d maids
5060,"Like Amazons come tripping after drums,"
5061,"Their thimbles into armed gauntlets change,"
5062,"Their needles to lances, and their gentle hearts"
5063,To fierce and bloody inclination.
5064,"There end thy brave, and turn thy face in peace;"
5065,We grant thou canst outscold us. Fare thee well;
5066,We hold our time too precious to be spent
5067,With such a brabbler.
5068,Give me leave to speak.
5069,"No, I will speak."
5070,We will attend to neither.
5071,"Strike up the drums; and let the tongue of war,"
5072,Plead for our interest and our being here.
5073,"Indeed, your drums, being beaten, will cry out;"
5074,"And so shall you, being beaten. Do but start"
5075,"And echo with the clamour of thy drum,"
5076,And even at hand a drum is ready brac’d
5077,That shall reverberate all as loud as thine.
5078,"Sound but another, and another shall,"
5079,"As loud as thine, rattle the welkin’s ear"
5080,"And mock the deep-mouth’d thunder. For at hand,"
5081,"Not trusting to this halting legate here,"
5082,"Whom he hath us’d rather for sport than need,"
5083,Is warlike John; and in his forehead sits
5084,"A bare-ribb’d death, whose office is this day"
5085,To feast upon whole thousands of the French.
5086,"Strike up our drums, to find this danger out."
5087,"And thou shalt find it, Dauphin, do not doubt."
5088,SCENE III. The same. The Field of Battle.
5089,Alarums. Enter King John and Hubert.
5090,"How goes the day with us? O, tell me, Hubert."
5091,"Badly, I fear. How fares your majesty?"
5092,This fever that hath troubled me so long
5093,"Lies heavy on me. O, my heart is sick!"
5094,"My lord, your valiant kinsman, Faulconbridge,"
5095,Desires your majesty to leave the field
5096,And send him word by me which way you go.
5097,"Tell him, toward Swinstead, to the abbey there."
5098,Be of good comfort; for the great supply
5099,That was expected by the Dauphin here
5100,Are wrack’d three nights ago on Goodwin Sands.
5101,This news was brought to Richard but even now.
5102,"The French fight coldly, and retire themselves."
5103,"Ay me, this tyrant fever burns me up"
5104,And will not let me welcome this good news.
5105,Set on toward Swinstead. To my litter straight.
5106,"Weakness possesseth me, and I am faint."
5107,SCENE IV. The same. Another part of the same.
5108,"Enter Salisbury, Pembroke and Bigot."
5109,I did not think the King so stor’d with friends.
5110,Up once again; put spirit in the French.
5111,"If they miscarry, we miscarry too."
5112,"That misbegotten devil, Faulconbridge,"
5113,"In spite of spite, alone upholds the day."
5114,"They say King John, sore sick, hath left the field."
5115,"Enter Melun wounded, and led by Soldiers."
5116,Lead me to the revolts of England here.
5117,When we were happy we had other names.
5118,It is the Count Melun.
5119,"Fly, noble English, you are bought and sold;"
5120,Unthread the rude eye of rebellion
5121,And welcome home again discarded faith.
5122,Seek out King John and fall before his feet;
5123,"For if the French be lords of this loud day,"
5124,He means to recompense the pains you take
5125,"By cutting off your heads. Thus hath he sworn,"
5126,"And I with him, and many more with me,"
5127,Upon the altar at Saint Edmundsbury;
5128,Even on that altar where we swore to you
5129,Dear amity and everlasting love.
5130,May this be possible? May this be true?
5131,"Have I not hideous death within my view,"
5132,"Retaining but a quantity of life,"
5133,Which bleeds away even as a form of wax
5134,Resolveth from his figure ’gainst the fire?
5135,"What in the world should make me now deceive,"
5136,Since I must lose the use of all deceit?
5137,"Why should I then be false, since it is true"
5138,That I must die here and live hence by truth?
5139,"I say again, if Louis do win the day,"
5140,He is forsworn if e’er those eyes of yours
5141,Behold another day break in the east.
5142,"But even this night, whose black contagious breath"
5143,Already smokes about the burning crest
5144,"Of the old, feeble, and day-wearied sun,"
5145,"Even this ill night, your breathing shall expire,"
5146,Paying the fine of rated treachery
5147,"Even with a treacherous fine of all your lives,"
5148,If Louis by your assistance win the day.
5149,"Commend me to one Hubert, with your king;"
5150,"The love of him, and this respect besides,"
5151,"For that my grandsire was an Englishman,"
5152,Awakes my conscience to confess all this.
5153,"In lieu whereof, I pray you, bear me hence"
5154,"From forth the noise and rumour of the field,"
5155,Where I may think the remnant of my thoughts
5156,"In peace, and part this body and my soul"
5157,With contemplation and devout desires.
5158,"We do believe thee, and beshrew my soul"
5159,But I do love the favour and the form
5160,"Of this most fair occasion, by the which"
5161,"We will untread the steps of damned flight,"
5162,"And like a bated and retired flood,"
5163,"Leaving our rankness and irregular course,"
5164,"Stoop low within those bounds we have o’erlook’d,"
5165,And calmly run on in obedience
5166,"Even to our ocean, to our great King John."
5167,My arm shall give thee help to bear thee hence;
5168,For I do see the cruel pangs of death
5169,"Right in thine eye.—Away, my friends! New flight,"
5170,"And happy newness, that intends old right."
5171,SCENE V. The same. The French camp.
5172,Enter Louis and his train.
5173,"The sun of heaven, methought, was loath to set,"
5174,"But stay’d, and made the western welkin blush,"
5175,When the English measure backward their own ground
5176,"In faint retire. O, bravely came we off,"
5177,"When with a volley of our needless shot,"
5178,"After such bloody toil, we bid good night,"
5179,"And wound our tott’ring colours clearly up,"
5180,"Last in the field, and almost lords of it!"
5181,"Where is my prince, the Dauphin?"
5182,The Count Melun is slain; the English lords
5183,"By his persuasion are again fall’n off,"
5184,"And your supply, which you have wish’d so long,"
5185,Are cast away and sunk on Goodwin Sands.
5186,"Ah, foul shrewd news! Beshrew thy very heart!"
5187,I did not think to be so sad tonight
5188,As this hath made me. Who was he that said
5189,King John did fly an hour or two before
5190,The stumbling night did part our weary powers?
5191,"Whoever spoke it, it is true, my lord."
5192,"Well, keep good quarter and good care tonight."
5193,"The day shall not be up so soon as I,"
5194,To try the fair adventure of tomorrow.
5195,SCENE VI. An open place in the neighborhood of Swinstead Abbey.
5196,"Enter the Bastard and Hubert, meeting."
5197,"Who’s there? Speak, ho! Speak quickly, or I shoot."
5198,A friend. What art thou?
5199,Of the part of England.
5200,Whither dost thou go?
5201,What’s that to thee? Why may I not demand
5202,"Of thine affairs, as well as thou of mine?"
5203,Thou hast a perfect thought.
5204,"I will, upon all hazards, well believe"
5205,"Thou art my friend, that know’st my tongue so well."
5206,"Who thou wilt. And if thou please,"
5207,Thou mayst befriend me so much as to think
5208,I come one way of the Plantagenets.
5209,Unkind remembrance! Thou and eyeless night
5210,"Have done me shame. Brave soldier, pardon me,"
5211,That any accent breaking from thy tongue
5212,Should ’scape the true acquaintance of mine ear.
5213,"Come, come; sans compliment, what news abroad?"
5214,"Why, here walk I in the black brow of night,"
5215,To find you out.
5216,"Brief, then; and what’s the news?"
5217,"O, my sweet sir, news fitting to the night,"
5218,"Black, fearful, comfortless, and horrible."
5219,Show me the very wound of this ill news.
5220,"I am no woman, I’ll not swoon at it."
5221,"The King, I fear, is poison’d by a monk."
5222,"I left him almost speechless, and broke out"
5223,"To acquaint you with this evil, that you might"
5224,"The better arm you to the sudden time,"
5225,Than if you had at leisure known of this.
5226,How did he take it? Who did taste to him?
5227,"A monk, I tell you, a resolved villain,"
5228,Whose bowels suddenly burst out. The King
5229,"Yet speaks, and peradventure may recover."
5230,Who didst thou leave to tend his majesty?
5231,"Why, know you not? The lords are all come back,"
5232,And brought Prince Henry in their company;
5233,"At whose request the King hath pardon’d them,"
5234,And they are all about his majesty.
5235,"Withhold thine indignation, mighty heaven,"
5236,And tempt us not to bear above our power!
5237,"I’ll tell thee, Hubert, half my power this night,"
5238,"Passing these flats, are taken by the tide;"
5239,These Lincoln Washes have devoured them;
5240,"Myself, well mounted, hardly have escap’d."
5241,"Away, before. Conduct me to the King;"
5242,I doubt he will be dead or ere I come.
5243,SCENE VII. The orchard of Swinstead Abbey.
5244,"Enter Prince Henry, Salisbury and Bigot."
5245,It is too late. The life of all his blood
5246,"Is touch’d corruptibly, and his pure brain,"
5247,"Which some suppose the soul’s frail dwelling-house,"
5248,"Doth, by the idle comments that it makes,"
5249,Foretell the ending of mortality.
5250,"His Highness yet doth speak, and holds belief"
5251,"That, being brought into the open air,"
5252,It would allay the burning quality
5253,Of that fell poison which assaileth him.
5254,Let him be brought into the orchard here.
5255,Doth he still rage?
5256,He is more patient
5257,Than when you left him; even now he sung.
5258,O vanity of sickness! Fierce extremes
5259,In their continuance will not feel themselves.
5260,"Death, having prey’d upon the outward parts,"
5261,"Leaves them invisible, and his siege is now"
5262,"Against the mind, the which he pricks and wounds"
5263,"With many legions of strange fantasies,"
5264,"Which, in their throng and press to that last hold,"
5265,Confound themselves. ’Tis strange that death should sing.
5266,"I am the cygnet to this pale faint swan,"
5267,Who chants a doleful hymn to his own death
5268,And from the organ-pipe of frailty sings
5269,His soul and body to their lasting rest.
5270,"Be of good comfort, prince; for you are born"
5271,To set a form upon that indigest
5272,Which he hath left so shapeless and so rude.
5273,"Enter Bigot and Attendants, who bring in King John in a chair."
5274,"Ay, marry, now my soul hath elbow-room"
5275,It would not out at windows nor at doors.
5276,There is so hot a summer in my bosom
5277,That all my bowels crumble up to dust.
5278,"I am a scribbled form, drawn with a pen"
5279,"Upon a parchment, and against this fire"
5280,Do I shrink up.
5281,How fares your majesty?
5282,"Poison’d, ill fare; dead, forsook, cast off,"
5283,And none of you will bid the winter come
5284,"To thrust his icy fingers in my maw,"
5285,Nor let my kingdom’s rivers take their course
5286,"Through my burn’d bosom, nor entreat the north"
5287,To make his bleak winds kiss my parched lips
5288,"And comfort me with cold. I do not ask you much,"
5289,"I beg cold comfort; and you are so strait,"
5290,"And so ingrateful, you deny me that."
5291,"O, that there were some virtue in my tears"
5292,That might relieve you!
5293,The salt in them is hot.
5294,Within me is a hell; and there the poison
5295,"Is, as a fiend, confin’d to tyrannize"
5296,On unreprievable condemned blood.
5297,"O, I am scalded with my violent motion"
5298,And spleen of speed to see your majesty!
5299,"O cousin, thou art come to set mine eye."
5300,"The tackle of my heart is crack’d and burn’d,"
5301,And all the shrouds wherewith my life should sail
5302,"Are turned to one thread, one little hair."
5303,"My heart hath one poor string to stay it by,"
5304,Which holds but till thy news be uttered;
5305,And then all this thou seest is but a clod
5306,And module of confounded royalty.
5307,"The Dauphin is preparing hitherward,"
5308,Where God He knows how we shall answer him;
5309,"For in a night the best part of my power,"
5310,"As I upon advantage did remove,"
5311,Were in the Washes all unwarily
5312,Devoured by the unexpected flood.
5313,You breathe these dead news in as dead an ear.
5314,"My liege! My lord!—But now a king, now thus."
5315,"Even so must I run on, and even so stop."
5316,"What surety of the world, what hope, what stay,"
5317,"When this was now a king, and now is clay?"
5318,Art thou gone so? I do but stay behind
5319,"To do the office for thee of revenge,"
5320,"And then my soul shall wait on thee to heaven,"
5321,As it on earth hath been thy servant still.
5322,"Now, now, you stars that move in your right spheres,"
5323,"Where be your powers? Show now your mended faiths,"
5324,"And instantly return with me again,"
5325,To push destruction and perpetual shame
5326,Out of the weak door of our fainting land.
5327,"Straight let us seek, or straight we shall be sought;"
5328,The Dauphin rages at our very heels.
5329,"It seems you know not, then, so much as we."
5330,"The Cardinal Pandulph is within at rest,"
5331,"Who half an hour since came from the Dauphin,"
5332,And brings from him such offers of our peace
5333,"As we with honour and respect may take,"
5334,With purpose presently to leave this war.
5335,He will the rather do it when he sees
5336,Ourselves well sinewed to our defence.
5337,"Nay, ’tis in a manner done already,"
5338,For many carriages he hath dispatch’d
5339,"To the sea-side, and put his cause and quarrel"
5340,"To the disposing of the cardinal,"
5341,"With whom yourself, myself, and other lords,"
5342,"If you think meet, this afternoon will post"
5343,To consummate this business happily.
5344,"Let it be so. And you, my noble prince,"
5345,"With other princes that may best be spar’d,"
5346,Shall wait upon your father’s funeral.
5347,At Worcester must his body be interr’d;
5348,For so he will’d it.
5349,"Thither shall it, then,"
5350,And happily may your sweet self put on
5351,The lineal state and glory of the land!
5352,"To whom, with all submission, on my knee,"
5353,I do bequeath my faithful services
5354,And true subjection everlastingly.
5355,"And the like tender of our love we make,"
5356,To rest without a spot for evermore.
5357,I have a kind soul that would give you thanks
5358,And knows not how to do it but with tears.
5359,"O, let us pay the time but needful woe,"
5360,Since it hath been beforehand with our griefs.
5361,"This England never did, nor never shall,"
5362,"Lie at the proud foot of a conqueror,"
5363,But when it first did help to wound itself.
5364,"Now these her princes are come home again,"
5365,Come the three corners of the world in arms
5366,"And we shall shock them. Nought shall make us rue,"
5367,If England to itself do rest but true.

5425,"Thou art a cobbler, art thou?"
5426,"Truly, sir, all that I live by is with the awl; I meddle with no"
5427,"tradesman’s matters, nor women’s matters, but withal I am indeed, sir,"
5428,"a surgeon to old shoes: when they are in great danger, I recover them."
5429,As proper men as ever trod upon neat’s leather have gone upon my
5430,But wherefore art not in thy shop today?
5431,Why dost thou lead these men about the streets?
5432,"Truly, sir, to wear out their shoes, to get myself into more work. But"
5433,"indeed, sir, we make holiday to see Caesar, and to rejoice in his"
5434,Wherefore rejoice? What conquest brings he home?
5435,"What tributaries follow him to Rome,"
5436,To grace in captive bonds his chariot wheels?
5437,"You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things!"
5438,"O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,"
5439,Knew you not Pompey? Many a time and oft
5440,"Have you climb’d up to walls and battlements,"
5441,"To towers and windows, yea, to chimney tops,"
5442,"Your infants in your arms, and there have sat"
5443,"The livelong day with patient expectation,"
5444,To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome.
5445,"And when you saw his chariot but appear,"
5446,"Have you not made an universal shout,"
5447,That Tiber trembled underneath her banks
5448,To hear the replication of your sounds
5449,Made in her concave shores?
5450,And do you now put on your best attire?
5451,And do you now cull out a holiday?
5452,"And do you now strew flowers in his way,"
5453,That comes in triumph over Pompey’s blood?
5454,"Run to your houses, fall upon your knees,"
5455,Pray to the gods to intermit the plague
5456,That needs must light on this ingratitude.
5457,"Go, go, good countrymen, and, for this fault"
5458,"Assemble all the poor men of your sort,"
5459,"Draw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tears"
5460,"Into the channel, till the lowest stream"
5461,Do kiss the most exalted shores of all.
5462,See whether their basest metal be not mov’d;
5463,They vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness.
5464,Go you down that way towards the Capitol;
5465,"This way will I. Disrobe the images,"
5466,If you do find them deck’d with ceremonies.
5467,May we do so?
5468,You know it is the feast of Lupercal.
5469,It is no matter; let no images
5470,Be hung with Caesar’s trophies. I’ll about
5471,And drive away the vulgar from the streets;
5472,"So do you too, where you perceive them thick."
5473,These growing feathers pluck’d from Caesar’s wing
5474,"Will make him fly an ordinary pitch,"
5475,"Who else would soar above the view of men,"
5476,And keep us all in servile fearfulness.
5477,SCENE II. The same. A public place.
5478,"Enter, in procession, with music, Caesar; Antony, for the course;"
5479,"Calphurnia, Portia, Decius, Cicero, Brutus, Cassius and Casca; a great"
5480,"crowd following, among them a Soothsayer."
5481,"Peace, ho! Caesar speaks."
5482,"Stand you directly in Antonius’ way,"
5483,When he doth run his course. Antonius.
5484,"Forget not in your speed, Antonius,"
5485,"To touch Calphurnia; for our elders say,"
5486,"The barren, touched in this holy chase,"
5487,Shake off their sterile curse.
5488,"When Caesar says “Do this,” it is perform’d."
5489,Set on; and leave no ceremony out.
5490,Bid every noise be still; peace yet again!
5491,Who is it in the press that calls on me?
5492,"I hear a tongue shriller than all the music,"
5493,Cry “Caesar”! Speak. Caesar is turn’d to hear.
5494,Beware the Ides of March.
5495,What man is that?
5496,A soothsayer bids you beware the Ides of March.
5497,Set him before me; let me see his face.
5498,"Fellow, come from the throng; look upon Caesar."
5499,What say’st thou to me now? Speak once again.
5500,Beware the Ides of March.
5501,He is a dreamer; let us leave him. Pass.
5502,Will you go see the order of the course?
5503,"I pray you, do."
5504,I am not gamesome: I do lack some part
5505,Of that quick spirit that is in Antony.
5506,"Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires;"
5507,"Brutus, I do observe you now of late:"
5508,I have not from your eyes that gentleness
5509,And show of love as I was wont to have.
5510,You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand
5511,Over your friend that loves you.
5512,"Be not deceived: if I have veil’d my look,"
5513,I turn the trouble of my countenance
5514,Merely upon myself. Vexed I am
5515,"Of late with passions of some difference,"
5516,"Conceptions only proper to myself,"
5517,Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors;
5518,But let not therefore my good friends be grieved
5519,"Nor construe any further my neglect,"
5520,"Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war,"
5521,Forgets the shows of love to other men.
5522,"Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion;"
5523,By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried
5524,"Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations."
5525,"Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?"
5526,"No, Cassius, for the eye sees not itself"
5527,"But by reflection, by some other thing."
5528,"And it is very much lamented, Brutus,"
5529,That you have no such mirrors as will turn
5530,"Your hidden worthiness into your eye,"
5531,That you might see your shadow. I have heard
5532,"Where many of the best respect in Rome,"
5533,"And groaning underneath this age’s yoke,"
5534,Have wish’d that noble Brutus had his eyes.
5535,"Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,"
5536,That you would have me seek into myself
5537,For that which is not in me?
5538,"Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear;"
5539,And since you know you cannot see yourself
5540,"So well as by reflection, I, your glass,"
5541,Will modestly discover to yourself
5542,That of yourself which you yet know not of.
5543,"And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus:"
5544,"Were I a common laugher, or did use"
5545,To stale with ordinary oaths my love
5546,To every new protester; if you know
5547,"That I do fawn on men, and hug them hard,"
5548,And after scandal them; or if you know
5549,"That I profess myself in banqueting,"
5550,"To all the rout, then hold me dangerous."
5551,What means this shouting? I do fear the people
5552,Choose Caesar for their king.
5553,"Ay, do you fear it?"
5554,Then must I think you would not have it so.
5555,"I would not, Cassius; yet I love him well,"
5556,But wherefore do you hold me here so long?
5557,What is it that you would impart to me?
5558,"If it be aught toward the general good,"
5559,"Set honour in one eye and death i’ the other,"
5560,And I will look on both indifferently;
5561,For let the gods so speed me as I love
5562,The name of honour more than I fear death.
5563,"I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,"
5564,As well as I do know your outward favour.
5565,"Well, honour is the subject of my story."
5566,I cannot tell what you and other men
5567,"Think of this life; but, for my single self,"
5568,I had as lief not be as live to be
5569,In awe of such a thing as I myself.
5570,I was born free as Caesar; so were you;
5571,"We both have fed as well, and we can both"
5572,Endure the winter’s cold as well as he:
5573,"For once, upon a raw and gusty day,"
5574,"The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,"
5575,"Caesar said to me, “Dar’st thou, Cassius, now"
5576,"Leap in with me into this angry flood,"
5577,"And swim to yonder point?” Upon the word,"
5578,"Accoutred as I was, I plunged in,"
5579,And bade him follow: so indeed he did.
5580,"The torrent roar’d, and we did buffet it"
5581,"With lusty sinews, throwing it aside"
5582,And stemming it with hearts of controversy.
5583,"But ere we could arrive the point propos’d,"
5584,"Caesar cried, “Help me, Cassius, or I sink!”"
5585,"I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor,"
5586,Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder
5587,"The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber"
5588,Did I the tired Caesar. And this man
5589,Is now become a god; and Cassius is
5590,"A wretched creature, and must bend his body,"
5591,If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.
5592,"He had a fever when he was in Spain,"
5593,And when the fit was on him I did mark
5594,"How he did shake: ’tis true, this god did shake:"
5595,"His coward lips did from their colour fly,"
5596,And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world
5597,Did lose his lustre. I did hear him groan:
5598,"Ay, and that tongue of his, that bade the Romans"
5599,"Mark him, and write his speeches in their books,"
5600,"Alas, it cried, “Give me some drink, Titinius,”"
5601,"As a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me,"
5602,A man of such a feeble temper should
5603,"So get the start of the majestic world,"
5604,And bear the palm alone.
5605,I do believe that these applauses are
5606,For some new honours that are heap’d on Caesar.
5607,"Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world"
5608,"Like a Colossus, and we petty men"
5609,"Walk under his huge legs, and peep about"
5610,To find ourselves dishonourable graves.
5611,Men at some time are masters of their fates:
5612,"The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,"
5613,"But in ourselves, that we are underlings."
5614,“Brutus” and “Caesar”: what should be in that “Caesar”?
5615,Why should that name be sounded more than yours?
5616,"Write them together, yours is as fair a name;"
5617,"Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;"
5618,"Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with ’em,"
5619,“Brutus” will start a spirit as soon as “Caesar.”
5620,"Now in the names of all the gods at once,"
5621,"Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed,"
5622,"That he is grown so great? Age, thou art sham’d!"
5623,"Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!"
5624,"When went there by an age since the great flood,"
5625,But it was fam’d with more than with one man?
5626,"When could they say, till now, that talk’d of Rome,"
5627,That her wide walls encompass’d but one man?
5628,"Now is it Rome indeed, and room enough,"
5629,When there is in it but one only man.
5630,"O, you and I have heard our fathers say,"
5631,There was a Brutus once that would have brook’d
5632,"Th’ eternal devil to keep his state in Rome,"
5633,As easily as a king!
5634,"That you do love me, I am nothing jealous;"
5635,"What you would work me to, I have some aim:"
5636,"How I have thought of this, and of these times,"
5637,"I shall recount hereafter. For this present,"
5638,"I would not, so with love I might entreat you,"
5639,"Be any further mov’d. What you have said,"
5640,I will consider; what you have to say
5641,I will with patience hear; and find a time
5642,Both meet to hear and answer such high things.
5643,"Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this:"
5644,Brutus had rather be a villager
5645,Than to repute himself a son of Rome
5646,Under these hard conditions as this time
5647,Is like to lay upon us.
5648,I am glad that my weak words
5649,Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.
5650,Enter Caesar and his Train.
5651,"The games are done, and Caesar is returning."
5652,"As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve,"
5653,"And he will, after his sour fashion, tell you"
5654,What hath proceeded worthy note today.
5655,"I will do so. But, look you, Cassius,"
5656,"The angry spot doth glow on Caesar’s brow,"
5657,And all the rest look like a chidden train:
5658,Calphurnia’s cheek is pale; and Cicero
5659,Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes
5660,"As we have seen him in the Capitol,"
5661,Being cross’d in conference by some senators.
5662,Casca will tell us what the matter is.
5663,"Let me have men about me that are fat,"
5664,"Sleek-headed men, and such as sleep a-nights:"
5665,Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look;
5666,He thinks too much: such men are dangerous.
5667,"Fear him not, Caesar; he’s not dangerous;"
5668,He is a noble Roman and well given.
5669,Would he were fatter! But I fear him not:
5670,"Yet if my name were liable to fear,"
5671,I do not know the man I should avoid
5672,"So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much,"
5673,"He is a great observer, and he looks"
5674,"Quite through the deeds of men. He loves no plays,"
5675,"As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music."
5676,Seldom he smiles; and smiles in such a sort
5677,As if he mock’d himself and scorn’d his spirit
5678,That could be mov’d to smile at anything.
5679,Such men as he be never at heart’s ease
5680,"Whiles they behold a greater than themselves,"
5681,And therefore are they very dangerous.
5682,I rather tell thee what is to be fear’d
5683,Than what I fear; for always I am Caesar.
5684,"Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf,"
5685,And tell me truly what thou think’st of him.
5686,You pull’d me by the cloak; would you speak with me?
5687,"Ay, Casca, tell us what hath chanc’d today,"
5688,That Caesar looks so sad.
5689,"Why, you were with him, were you not?"
5690,I should not then ask Casca what had chanc’d.
5691,"Why, there was a crown offer’d him; and being offer’d him, he put it by"
5692,"with the back of his hand, thus; and then the people fell a-shouting."
5693,What was the second noise for?
5694,"Why, for that too."
5695,They shouted thrice: what was the last cry for?
5696,"Why, for that too."
5697,Was the crown offer’d him thrice?
5698,"Ay, marry, was’t, and he put it by thrice, every time gentler than"
5699,other; and at every putting-by mine honest neighbours shouted.
5700,Who offer’d him the crown?
5701,"Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca."
5702,"I can as well be hang’d, as tell the manner of it: it was mere foolery;"
5703,I did not mark it. I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown; yet ’twas not a
5704,"crown neither, ’twas one of these coronets; and, as I told you, he put"
5705,"it by once: but, for all that, to my thinking, he would fain have had"
5706,"it. Then he offered it to him again: then he put it by again: but, to"
5707,"my thinking, he was very loath to lay his fingers off it. And then he"
5708,"offered it the third time; he put it the third time by; and still, as"
5709,"he refus’d it, the rabblement hooted, and clapp’d their chopt hands,"
5710,"and threw up their sweaty night-caps, and uttered such a deal of"
5711,"stinking breath because Caesar refus’d the crown, that it had, almost,"
5712,"choked Caesar, for he swooned, and fell down at it. And for mine own"
5713,"part, I durst not laugh, for fear of opening my lips and receiving the"
5714,"But, soft! I pray you. What, did Caesar swoon?"
5715,"He fell down in the market-place, and foam’d at mouth, and was"
5716,’Tis very like: he hath the falling-sickness.
5717,"No, Caesar hath it not; but you, and I,"
5718,"And honest Casca, we have the falling-sickness."
5719,I know not what you mean by that; but I am sure Caesar fell down. If
5720,"the tag-rag people did not clap him and hiss him, according as he"
5721,"pleased and displeased them, as they use to do the players in the"
5722,"theatre, I am no true man."
5723,What said he when he came unto himself?
5724,"Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the common herd was glad"
5725,"he refused the crown, he pluck’d me ope his doublet, and offer’d them"
5726,"his throat to cut. And I had been a man of any occupation, if I would"
5727,"not have taken him at a word, I would I might go to hell among the"
5728,"rogues. And so he fell. When he came to himself again, he said, if he"
5729,"had done or said anything amiss, he desir’d their worships to think it"
5730,"was his infirmity. Three or four wenches where I stood cried, “Alas,"
5731,good soul!” and forgave him with all their hearts. But there’s no heed
5732,"to be taken of them: if Caesar had stabb’d their mothers, they would"
5733,have done no less.
5734,"And, after that, he came thus sad away?"
5735,Did Cicero say anything?
5736,"Ay, he spoke Greek."
5737,"Nay, and I tell you that, I’ll ne’er look you i’ the face again. But"
5738,those that understood him smil’d at one another and shook their heads;
5739,"but for mine own part, it was Greek to me. I could tell you more news"
5740,"too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarfs off Caesar’s images, are"
5741,"put to silence. Fare you well. There was more foolery yet, if I could"
5742,"Will you sup with me tonight, Casca?"
5743,"No, I am promis’d forth."
5744,Will you dine with me tomorrow?
5745,"Ay, if I be alive, and your mind hold, and your dinner worth the"
5746,Good. I will expect you.
5747,Do so; farewell both.
5748,What a blunt fellow is this grown to be!
5749,He was quick mettle when he went to school.
5750,So is he now in execution
5751,"Of any bold or noble enterprise,"
5752,However he puts on this tardy form.
5753,"This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit,"
5754,Which gives men stomach to digest his words
5755,And so it is. For this time I will leave you:
5756,"Tomorrow, if you please to speak with me,"
5757,"I will come home to you; or, if you will,"
5758,"Come home to me, and I will wait for you."
5759,"I will do so: till then, think of the world."
5760,"Well, Brutus, thou art noble; yet I see,"
5761,Thy honourable metal may be wrought
5762,From that it is dispos’d: therefore ’tis meet
5763,That noble minds keep ever with their likes;
5764,For who so firm that cannot be seduc’d?
5765,"Caesar doth bear me hard, but he loves Brutus."
5766,"If I were Brutus now, and he were Cassius,"
5767,"He should not humour me. I will this night,"
5768,"In several hands, in at his windows throw,"
5769,"As if they came from several citizens,"
5770,"Writings, all tending to the great opinion"
5771,That Rome holds of his name; wherein obscurely
5772,Caesar’s ambition shall be glanced at.
5773,"And after this, let Caesar seat him sure,"
5774,"For we will shake him, or worse days endure."
5775,SCENE III. The same. A street.
5776,"Thunder and lightning. Enter, from opposite sides, Casca with his sword"
5777,"Good even, Casca: brought you Caesar home?"
5778,"Why are you breathless, and why stare you so?"
5779,"Are not you moved, when all the sway of earth"
5780,"Shakes like a thing unfirm? O Cicero,"
5781,"I have seen tempests, when the scolding winds"
5782,Have riv’d the knotty oaks; and I have seen
5783,"Th’ ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam,"
5784,To be exalted with the threatening clouds:
5785,"But never till tonight, never till now,"
5786,Did I go through a tempest dropping fire.
5787,"Either there is a civil strife in heaven,"
5788,"Or else the world too saucy with the gods,"
5789,Incenses them to send destruction.
5790,"Why, saw you anything more wonderful?"
5791,"A common slave, you’d know him well by sight,"
5792,"Held up his left hand, which did flame and burn"
5793,"Like twenty torches join’d, and yet his hand,"
5794,Not sensible of fire remain’d unscorch’d.
5795,"Besides, I ha’ not since put up my sword,"
5796,"Against the Capitol I met a lion,"
5797,"Who glared upon me, and went surly by,"
5798,Without annoying me. And there were drawn
5799,"Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women,"
5800,Transformed with their fear; who swore they saw
5801,"Men, all in fire, walk up and down the streets."
5802,"And yesterday the bird of night did sit,"
5803,"Even at noonday upon the marketplace,"
5804,Hooting and shrieking. When these prodigies
5805,"Do so conjointly meet, let not men say,"
5806,“These are their reasons; they are natural”;
5807,"For I believe, they are portentous things"
5808,Unto the climate that they point upon.
5809,"Indeed, it is a strange-disposed time."
5810,"But men may construe things after their fashion,"
5811,Clean from the purpose of the things themselves.
5812,Comes Caesar to the Capitol tomorrow?
5813,"He doth, for he did bid Antonius"
5814,Send word to you he would be there tomorrow.
5815,"Goodnight then, Casca: this disturbed sky"
5816,Is not to walk in.
5817,"Casca, by your voice."
5818,"Your ear is good. Cassius, what night is this!"
5819,A very pleasing night to honest men.
5820,Who ever knew the heavens menace so?
5821,Those that have known the earth so full of faults.
5822,"For my part, I have walk’d about the streets,"
5823,Submitting me unto the perilous night;
5824,"And, thus unbraced, Casca, as you see,"
5825,Have bar’d my bosom to the thunder-stone;
5826,And when the cross blue lightning seem’d to open
5827,"The breast of heaven, I did present myself"
5828,Even in the aim and very flash of it.
5829,But wherefore did you so much tempt the Heavens?
5830,"It is the part of men to fear and tremble,"
5831,When the most mighty gods by tokens send
5832,Such dreadful heralds to astonish us.
5833,"You are dull, Casca; and those sparks of life"
5834,"That should be in a Roman you do want,"
5835,"Or else you use not. You look pale and gaze,"
5836,"And put on fear and cast yourself in wonder,"
5837,To see the strange impatience of the Heavens:
5838,But if you would consider the true cause
5839,"Why all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts,"
5840,"Why birds and beasts, from quality and kind;"
5841,"Why old men, fools, and children calculate,"
5842,"Why all these things change from their ordinance,"
5843,"Their natures, and pre-formed faculties,"
5844,"To monstrous quality; why, you shall find"
5845,"That Heaven hath infus’d them with these spirits,"
5846,To make them instruments of fear and warning
5847,Unto some monstrous state.
5848,"Now could I, Casca, name to thee a man"
5849,"Most like this dreadful night,"
5850,"That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars,"
5851,As doth the lion in the Capitol;
5852,"A man no mightier than thyself, or me,"
5853,"In personal action; yet prodigious grown,"
5854,"And fearful, as these strange eruptions are."
5855,"’Tis Caesar that you mean; is it not, Cassius?"
5856,Let it be who it is: for Romans now
5857,Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors;
5858,"But, woe the while! our fathers’ minds are dead,"
5859,And we are govern’d with our mothers’ spirits;
5860,Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish.
5861,"Indeed, they say the senators tomorrow"
5862,Mean to establish Caesar as a king;
5863,"And he shall wear his crown by sea and land,"
5864,"In every place, save here in Italy."
5865,I know where I will wear this dagger then;
5866,Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius:
5867,"Therein, ye gods, you make the weak most strong;"
5868,"Therein, ye gods, you tyrants do defeat."
5869,"Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass,"
5870,"Nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron,"
5871,Can be retentive to the strength of spirit;
5872,"But life, being weary of these worldly bars,"
5873,Never lacks power to dismiss itself.
5874,"If I know this, know all the world besides,"
5875,That part of tyranny that I do bear
5876,I can shake off at pleasure.
5877,So every bondman in his own hand bears
5878,The power to cancel his captivity.
5879,And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?
5880,"Poor man! I know he would not be a wolf,"
5881,But that he sees the Romans are but sheep:
5882,"He were no lion, were not Romans hinds."
5883,Those that with haste will make a mighty fire
5884,"Begin it with weak straws. What trash is Rome,"
5885,"What rubbish, and what offal, when it serves"
5886,For the base matter to illuminate
5887,"So vile a thing as Caesar! But, O grief,"
5888,"Where hast thou led me? I, perhaps, speak this"
5889,Before a willing bondman: then I know
5890,"My answer must be made; but I am arm’d,"
5891,And dangers are to me indifferent.
5892,"You speak to Casca, and to such a man"
5893,"That is no fleering tell-tale. Hold, my hand:"
5894,"Be factious for redress of all these griefs,"
5895,And I will set this foot of mine as far
5896,As who goes farthest.
5897,There’s a bargain made.
5898,"Now know you, Casca, I have mov’d already"
5899,Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans
5900,To undergo with me an enterprise
5901,"And I do know by this, they stay for me"
5902,"In Pompey’s Porch: for now, this fearful night,"
5903,There is no stir or walking in the streets;
5904,And the complexion of the element
5905,"In favour’s like the work we have in hand,"
5906,"Most bloody, fiery, and most terrible."
5907,"Stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste."
5908,’Tis Cinna; I do know him by his gait;
5909,"He is a friend. Cinna, where haste you so?"
5910,To find out you. Who’s that? Metellus Cimber?
5911,"No, it is Casca, one incorporate"
5912,"To our attempts. Am I not stay’d for, Cinna?"
5913,I am glad on’t. What a fearful night is this!
5914,There’s two or three of us have seen strange sights.
5915,Am I not stay’d for? tell me.
5916,"Yes, you are. O Cassius, if you could"
5917,But win the noble Brutus to our party—
5918,"Be you content. Good Cinna, take this paper,"
5919,"And look you lay it in the praetor’s chair,"
5920,Where Brutus may but find it; and throw this
5921,In at his window; set this up with wax
5922,"Upon old Brutus’ statue: all this done,"
5923,"Repair to Pompey’s Porch, where you shall find us."
5924,Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?
5925,"All but Metellus Cimber, and he’s gone"
5926,"To seek you at your house. Well, I will hie,"
5927,And so bestow these papers as you bade me.
5928,"That done, repair to Pompey’s theatre."
5929,"Come, Casca, you and I will yet, ere day,"
5930,See Brutus at his house: three parts of him
5931,"Is ours already, and the man entire"
5932,"Upon the next encounter, yields him ours."
5933,"O, he sits high in all the people’s hearts!"
5934,"And that which would appear offence in us,"
5935,"His countenance, like richest alchemy,"
5936,Will change to virtue and to worthiness.
5937,"Him, and his worth, and our great need of him,"
5938,"You have right well conceited. Let us go,"
5939,"For it is after midnight; and ere day,"
5940,"We will awake him, and be sure of him."
5941,SCENE I. Rome. Brutus’ orchard.
5942,"I cannot, by the progress of the stars,"
5943,"Give guess how near to day.—Lucius, I say!"
5944,I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly.
5945,"When, Lucius, when? Awake, I say! What, Lucius!"
5946,"Call’d you, my lord?"
5947,"Get me a taper in my study, Lucius:"
5948,"When it is lighted, come and call me here."
5949,"I will, my lord."
5950,"It must be by his death: and for my part,"
5951,"I know no personal cause to spurn at him,"
5952,But for the general. He would be crown’d:
5953,"How that might change his nature, there’s the question."
5954,"It is the bright day that brings forth the adder,"
5955,And that craves wary walking. Crown him?—that;
5956,"And then, I grant, we put a sting in him,"
5957,That at his will he may do danger with.
5958,"Th’ abuse of greatness is, when it disjoins"
5959,"Remorse from power; and, to speak truth of Caesar,"
5960,I have not known when his affections sway’d
5961,"More than his reason. But ’tis a common proof,"
5962,"That lowliness is young ambition’s ladder,"
5963,Whereto the climber-upward turns his face;
5964,"But when he once attains the upmost round,"
5965,"He then unto the ladder turns his back,"
5966,"Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees"
5967,By which he did ascend. So Caesar may;
5968,"Then lest he may, prevent. And since the quarrel"
5969,"Will bear no colour for the thing he is,"
5970,"Fashion it thus: that what he is, augmented,"
5971,Would run to these and these extremities:
5972,And therefore think him as a serpent’s egg
5973,"Which hatch’d, would, as his kind grow mischievous;"
5974,And kill him in the shell.
5975,"The taper burneth in your closet, sir."
5976,"Searching the window for a flint, I found"
5977,"This paper, thus seal’d up, and I am sure"
5978,It did not lie there when I went to bed.
5979,Get you to bed again; it is not day.
5980,"Is not tomorrow, boy, the Ides of March?"
5981,"I know not, sir."
5982,"Look in the calendar, and bring me word."
5983,"The exhalations, whizzing in the air"
5984,Give so much light that I may read by them.
5985,"_Brutus, thou sleep’st: awake and see thyself."
5986,"Shall Rome, &c. Speak, strike, redress!_"
5987,"“Brutus, thou sleep’st: awake!”"
5988,Such instigations have been often dropp’d
5989,Where I have took them up.
5990,"“Shall Rome, &c.” Thus must I piece it out:"
5991,"Shall Rome stand under one man’s awe? What, Rome?"
5992,My ancestors did from the streets of Rome
5993,"The Tarquin drive, when he was call’d a king."
5994,"“Speak, strike, redress!” Am I entreated"
5995,"To speak and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise,"
5996,"If the redress will follow, thou receivest"
5997,Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus.
5998,"Sir, March is wasted fifteen days."
5999,"’Tis good. Go to the gate, somebody knocks."
6000,"Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar,"
6001,I have not slept.
6002,Between the acting of a dreadful thing
6003,"And the first motion, all the interim is"
6004,"Like a phantasma, or a hideous dream:"
6005,The genius and the mortal instruments
6006,"Are then in council; and the state of man,"
6007,"Like to a little kingdom, suffers then"
6008,The nature of an insurrection.
6009,"Sir, ’tis your brother Cassius at the door,"
6010,Who doth desire to see you.
6011,"No, sir, there are moe with him."
6012,Do you know them?
6013,"No, sir, their hats are pluck’d about their ears,"
6014,"And half their faces buried in their cloaks,"
6015,That by no means I may discover them
6016,By any mark of favour.
6017,"They are the faction. O conspiracy,"
6018,"Sham’st thou to show thy dangerous brow by night,"
6019,"When evils are most free? O, then, by day"
6020,Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough
6021,"To mask thy monstrous visage? Seek none, conspiracy;"
6022,Hide it in smiles and affability:
6023,"For if thou path, thy native semblance on,"
6024,Not Erebus itself were dim enough
6025,To hide thee from prevention.
6026,"Enter Cassius, Casca, Decius, Cinna, Metellus Cimber and Trebonius."
6027,I think we are too bold upon your rest:
6028,"Good morrow, Brutus; do we trouble you?"
6029,"I have been up this hour, awake all night."
6030,Know I these men that come along with you?
6031,"Yes, every man of them; and no man here"
6032,But honours you; and everyone doth wish
6033,You had but that opinion of yourself
6034,Which every noble Roman bears of you.
6035,He is welcome hither.
6036,He is welcome too.
6037,"This, Casca; this, Cinna; and this, Metellus Cimber."
6038,They are all welcome.
6039,What watchful cares do interpose themselves
6040,Betwixt your eyes and night?
6041,Shall I entreat a word?
6042,Here lies the east: doth not the day break here?
6043,"O, pardon, sir, it doth; and yon grey lines"
6044,That fret the clouds are messengers of day.
6045,You shall confess that you are both deceiv’d.
6046,"Here, as I point my sword, the Sun arises;"
6047,"Which is a great way growing on the South,"
6048,Weighing the youthful season of the year.
6049,"Some two months hence, up higher toward the North"
6050,He first presents his fire; and the high East
6051,"Stands, as the Capitol, directly here."
6052,"Give me your hands all over, one by one."
6053,And let us swear our resolution.
6054,"No, not an oath. If not the face of men,"
6055,"The sufferance of our souls, the time’s abuse—"
6056,"If these be motives weak, break off betimes,"
6057,And every man hence to his idle bed.
6058,"So let high-sighted tyranny range on,"
6059,"Till each man drop by lottery. But if these,"
6060,"As I am sure they do, bear fire enough"
6061,"To kindle cowards, and to steel with valour"
6062,"The melting spirits of women; then, countrymen,"
6063,What need we any spur but our own cause
6064,To prick us to redress? what other bond
6065,"Than secret Romans, that have spoke the word,"
6066,And will not palter? and what other oath
6067,"Than honesty to honesty engag’d,"
6068,"That this shall be, or we will fall for it?"
6069,"Swear priests and cowards, and men cautelous,"
6070,"Old feeble carrions, and such suffering souls"
6071,That welcome wrongs; unto bad causes swear
6072,Such creatures as men doubt; but do not stain
6073,"The even virtue of our enterprise,"
6074,"Nor th’ insuppressive mettle of our spirits,"
6075,To think that or our cause or our performance
6076,Did need an oath; when every drop of blood
6077,"That every Roman bears, and nobly bears,"
6078,"Is guilty of a several bastardy,"
6079,If he do break the smallest particle
6080,Of any promise that hath pass’d from him.
6081,But what of Cicero? Shall we sound him?
6082,I think he will stand very strong with us.
6083,Let us not leave him out.
6084,"No, by no means."
6085,"O, let us have him, for his silver hairs"
6086,"Will purchase us a good opinion,"
6087,And buy men’s voices to commend our deeds.
6088,"It shall be said, his judgement rul’d our hands;"
6089,"Our youths and wildness shall no whit appear,"
6090,But all be buried in his gravity.
6091,"O, name him not; let us not break with him;"
6092,For he will never follow anything
6093,That other men begin.
6094,Then leave him out.
6095,"Indeed, he is not fit."
6096,Shall no man else be touch’d but only Caesar?
6097,"Decius, well urg’d. I think it is not meet,"
6098,"Mark Antony, so well belov’d of Caesar,"
6099,Should outlive Caesar: we shall find of him
6100,"A shrewd contriver; and you know, his means,"
6101,"If he improve them, may well stretch so far"
6102,"As to annoy us all; which to prevent,"
6103,Let Antony and Caesar fall together.
6104,"Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,"
6105,"To cut the head off, and then hack the limbs,"
6106,"Like wrath in death, and envy afterwards;"
6107,For Antony is but a limb of Caesar.
6108,"Let us be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius."
6109,"We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar,"
6110,And in the spirit of men there is no blood.
6111,"O, that we then could come by Caesar’s spirit,"
6112,"And not dismember Caesar! But, alas,"
6113,"Caesar must bleed for it! And, gentle friends,"
6114,"Let’s kill him boldly, but not wrathfully;"
6115,"Let’s carve him as a dish fit for the gods,"
6116,Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds.
6117,"And let our hearts, as subtle masters do,"
6118,"Stir up their servants to an act of rage,"
6119,And after seem to chide ’em. This shall mark
6120,"Our purpose necessary, and not envious;"
6121,"Which so appearing to the common eyes,"
6122,"We shall be call’d purgers, not murderers."
6123,"And for Mark Antony, think not of him;"
6124,For he can do no more than Caesar’s arm
6125,When Caesar’s head is off.
6126,Yet I fear him;
6127,For in the ingrafted love he bears to Caesar—
6128,"Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him:"
6129,"If he love Caesar, all that he can do"
6130,Is to himself; take thought and die for Caesar.
6131,And that were much he should; for he is given
6132,"To sports, to wildness, and much company."
6133,There is no fear in him; let him not die;
6134,"For he will live, and laugh at this hereafter."
6135,Peace! count the clock.
6136,The clock hath stricken three.
6137,’Tis time to part.
6138,But it is doubtful yet
6139,Whether Caesar will come forth today or no;
6140,"For he is superstitious grown of late,"
6141,Quite from the main opinion he held once
6142,"Of fantasy, of dreams, and ceremonies."
6143,"It may be these apparent prodigies,"
6144,"The unaccustom’d terror of this night,"
6145,"And the persuasion of his augurers,"
6146,May hold him from the Capitol today.
6147,"Never fear that: if he be so resolved,"
6148,"I can o’ersway him, for he loves to hear"
6149,"That unicorns may be betray’d with trees,"
6150,"And bears with glasses, elephants with holes,"
6151,"Lions with toils, and men with flatterers."
6152,"But when I tell him he hates flatterers,"
6153,"He says he does, being then most flattered."
6154,"For I can give his humour the true bent,"
6155,And I will bring him to the Capitol.
6156,"Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him."
6157,By the eighth hour: is that the uttermost?
6158,Be that the uttermost; and fail not then.
6159,"Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard,"
6160,Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey;
6161,I wonder none of you have thought of him.
6162,"Now, good Metellus, go along by him:"
6163,"He loves me well, and I have given him reason;"
6164,"Send him but hither, and I’ll fashion him."
6165,"The morning comes upon’s. We’ll leave you, Brutus."
6166,"And, friends, disperse yourselves; but all remember"
6167,"What you have said, and show yourselves true Romans."
6168,"Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily;"
6169,"Let not our looks put on our purposes,"
6170,"But bear it as our Roman actors do,"
6171,With untired spirits and formal constancy.
6172,"And so, good morrow to you everyone."
6173,Boy! Lucius! Fast asleep? It is no matter;
6174,Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber:
6175,"Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies,"
6176,Which busy care draws in the brains of men;
6177,Therefore thou sleep’st so sound.
6178,"Portia, what mean you? Wherefore rise you now?"
6179,It is not for your health thus to commit
6180,Your weak condition to the raw cold morning.
6181,"Nor for yours neither. Y’ have ungently, Brutus,"
6182,"Stole from my bed; and yesternight at supper,"
6183,"You suddenly arose, and walk’d about,"
6184,"Musing and sighing, with your arms across;"
6185,"And when I ask’d you what the matter was,"
6186,You star’d upon me with ungentle looks.
6187,"I urg’d you further; then you scratch’d your head,"
6188,And too impatiently stamp’d with your foot;
6189,"Yet I insisted, yet you answer’d not,"
6190,But with an angry wafture of your hand
6191,"Gave sign for me to leave you. So I did,"
6192,Fearing to strengthen that impatience
6193,Which seem’d too much enkindled; and withal
6194,"Hoping it was but an effect of humour,"
6195,Which sometime hath his hour with every man.
6196,"It will not let you eat, nor talk, nor sleep;"
6197,And could it work so much upon your shape
6198,"As it hath much prevail’d on your condition,"
6199,"I should not know you, Brutus. Dear my lord,"
6200,Make me acquainted with your cause of grief.
6201,"I am not well in health, and that is all."
6202,"Brutus is wise, and, were he not in health,"
6203,He would embrace the means to come by it.
6204,"Why, so I do. Good Portia, go to bed."
6205,"Is Brutus sick, and is it physical"
6206,To walk unbraced and suck up the humours
6207,"Of the dank morning? What, is Brutus sick,"
6208,And will he steal out of his wholesome bed
6209,"To dare the vile contagion of the night,"
6210,And tempt the rheumy and unpurged air
6211,"To add unto his sickness? No, my Brutus;"
6212,"You have some sick offence within your mind,"
6213,"Which, by the right and virtue of my place,"
6214,"I ought to know of: and, upon my knees,"
6215,"I charm you, by my once commended beauty,"
6216,"By all your vows of love, and that great vow"
6217,"Which did incorporate and make us one,"
6218,"That you unfold to me, your self, your half,"
6219,"Why you are heavy, and what men tonight"
6220,Have had resort to you; for here have been
6221,"Some six or seven, who did hide their faces"
6222,"Kneel not, gentle Portia."
6223,"I should not need, if you were gentle Brutus."
6224,"Within the bond of marriage, tell me, Brutus,"
6225,Is it excepted I should know no secrets
6226,That appertain to you? Am I your self
6227,"But, as it were, in sort or limitation,"
6228,"To keep with you at meals, comfort your bed,"
6229,And talk to you sometimes? Dwell I but in the suburbs
6230,"Of your good pleasure? If it be no more,"
6231,"Portia is Brutus’ harlot, not his wife."
6232,"You are my true and honourable wife,"
6233,As dear to me as are the ruddy drops
6234,That visit my sad heart.
6235,"If this were true, then should I know this secret."
6236,I grant I am a woman; but withal
6237,A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife;
6238,I grant I am a woman; but withal
6239,"A woman well reputed, Cato’s daughter."
6240,"Think you I am no stronger than my sex,"
6241,Being so father’d and so husbanded?
6242,"Tell me your counsels, I will not disclose ’em."
6243,"I have made strong proof of my constancy,"
6244,Giving myself a voluntary wound
6245,"Here, in the thigh: can I bear that with patience"
6246,And not my husband’s secrets?
6247,Render me worthy of this noble wife!
6248,"Hark, hark, one knocks. Portia, go in awhile;"
6249,And by and by thy bosom shall partake
6250,The secrets of my heart.
6251,"All my engagements I will construe to thee,"
6252,All the charactery of my sad brows.
6253,Leave me with haste.
6254,Enter Lucius with Ligarius.
6255,"Lucius, who’s that knocks?"
6256,Here is a sick man that would speak with you.
6257,"Caius Ligarius, that Metellus spake of."
6258,"Boy, stand aside. Caius Ligarius, how?"
6259,Vouchsafe good-morrow from a feeble tongue.
6260,"O, what a time have you chose out, brave Caius,"
6261,To wear a kerchief! Would you were not sick!
6262,"I am not sick, if Brutus have in hand"
6263,Any exploit worthy the name of honour.
6264,"Such an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius,"
6265,Had you a healthful ear to hear of it.
6266,"By all the gods that Romans bow before,"
6267,I here discard my sickness. Soul of Rome!
6268,"Brave son, derived from honourable loins!"
6269,"Thou, like an exorcist, hast conjur’d up"
6270,"My mortified spirit. Now bid me run,"
6271,"And I will strive with things impossible,"
6272,"Yea, get the better of them. What’s to do?"
6273,A piece of work that will make sick men whole.
6274,But are not some whole that we must make sick?
6275,"That must we also. What it is, my Caius,"
6276,"I shall unfold to thee, as we are going,"
6277,To whom it must be done.
6278,"Set on your foot,"
6279,"And with a heart new-fir’d I follow you,"
6280,To do I know not what; but it sufficeth
6281,That Brutus leads me on.
6282,SCENE II. A room in Caesar’s palace.
6283,"Thunder and lightning. Enter Caesar, in his nightgown."
6284,Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace tonight:
6285,"Thrice hath Calphurnia in her sleep cried out,"
6286,"“Help, ho! They murder Caesar!” Who’s within?"
6287,"Go bid the priests do present sacrifice,"
6288,And bring me their opinions of success.
6289,"I will, my lord."
6290,"What mean you, Caesar? Think you to walk forth?"
6291,You shall not stir out of your house today.
6292,Caesar shall forth. The things that threaten’d me
6293,Ne’er look’d but on my back; when they shall see
6294,"The face of Caesar, they are vanished."
6295,"Caesar, I never stood on ceremonies,"
6296,"Yet now they fright me. There is one within,"
6297,"Besides the things that we have heard and seen,"
6298,Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch.
6299,"A lioness hath whelped in the streets,"
6300,"And graves have yawn’d, and yielded up their dead;"
6301,Fierce fiery warriors fight upon the clouds
6302,"In ranks and squadrons and right form of war,"
6303,Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol;
6304,"The noise of battle hurtled in the air,"
6305,"Horses did neigh, and dying men did groan,"
6306,And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets.
6307,"O Caesar, these things are beyond all use,"
6308,And I do fear them!
6309,What can be avoided
6310,Whose end is purpos’d by the mighty gods?
6311,Yet Caesar shall go forth; for these predictions
6312,Are to the world in general as to Caesar.
6313,"When beggars die, there are no comets seen;"
6314,The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes.
6315,Cowards die many times before their deaths;
6316,The valiant never taste of death but once.
6317,"Of all the wonders that I yet have heard,"
6318,"It seems to me most strange that men should fear,"
6319,"Seeing that death, a necessary end,"
6320,Will come when it will come.
6321,What say the augurers?
6322,They would not have you to stir forth today.
6323,"Plucking the entrails of an offering forth,"
6324,They could not find a heart within the beast.
6325,The gods do this in shame of cowardice:
6326,Caesar should be a beast without a heart
6327,If he should stay at home today for fear.
6328,"No, Caesar shall not. Danger knows full well"
6329,That Caesar is more dangerous than he.
6330,"We are two lions litter’d in one day,"
6331,"And I the elder and more terrible,"
6332,And Caesar shall go forth.
6333,Your wisdom is consum’d in confidence.
6334,Do not go forth today: call it my fear
6335,"That keeps you in the house, and not your own."
6336,"We’ll send Mark Antony to the Senate-house,"
6337,And he shall say you are not well today.
6338,Let me upon my knee prevail in this.
6339,"Mark Antony shall say I am not well,"
6340,"And for thy humour, I will stay at home."
6341,"Here’s Decius Brutus, he shall tell them so."
6342,"Caesar, all hail! Good morrow, worthy Caesar."
6343,I come to fetch you to the Senate-house.
6344,And you are come in very happy time
6345,"To bear my greeting to the Senators,"
6346,And tell them that I will not come today.
6347,"Cannot, is false; and that I dare not, falser:"
6348,"I will not come today. Tell them so, Decius."
6349,Say he is sick.
6350,Shall Caesar send a lie?
6351,"Have I in conquest stretch’d mine arm so far,"
6352,To be afeard to tell grey-beards the truth?
6353,"Decius, go tell them Caesar will not come."
6354,"Most mighty Caesar, let me know some cause,"
6355,Lest I be laugh’d at when I tell them so.
6356,The cause is in my will; I will not come.
6357,That is enough to satisfy the Senate.
6358,"But for your private satisfaction,"
6359,"Because I love you, I will let you know:"
6360,"Calphurnia here, my wife, stays me at home."
6361,"She dreamt tonight she saw my statue,"
6362,Which like a fountain with an hundred spouts
6363,Did run pure blood; and many lusty Romans
6364,"Came smiling, and did bathe their hands in it."
6365,And these does she apply for warnings and portents
6366,And evils imminent; and on her knee
6367,Hath begg’d that I will stay at home today.
6368,This dream is all amiss interpreted:
6369,It was a vision fair and fortunate.
6370,"Your statue spouting blood in many pipes,"
6371,"In which so many smiling Romans bath’d,"
6372,Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck
6373,"Reviving blood, and that great men shall press"
6374,"For tinctures, stains, relics, and cognizance."
6375,This by Calphurnia’s dream is signified.
6376,And this way have you well expounded it.
6377,"I have, when you have heard what I can say;"
6378,And know it now. The Senate have concluded
6379,To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar.
6380,"If you shall send them word you will not come,"
6381,"Their minds may change. Besides, it were a mock"
6382,"Apt to be render’d, for someone to say,"
6383,"“Break up the Senate till another time,"
6384,When Caesar’s wife shall meet with better dreams.”
6385,"If Caesar hide himself, shall they not whisper"
6386,"“Lo, Caesar is afraid”?"
6387,"Pardon me, Caesar; for my dear dear love"
6388,"To your proceeding bids me tell you this,"
6389,And reason to my love is liable.
6390,"How foolish do your fears seem now, Calphurnia!"
6391,I am ashamed I did yield to them.
6392,"Give me my robe, for I will go."
6393,"Enter Brutus, Ligarius, Metellus, Casca, Trebonius, Cinna and Publius."
6394,And look where Publius is come to fetch me.
6395,"What, Brutus, are you stirr’d so early too?"
6396,"Good morrow, Casca. Caius Ligarius,"
6397,Caesar was ne’er so much your enemy
6398,As that same ague which hath made you lean.
6399,"Caesar, ’tis strucken eight."
6400,I thank you for your pains and courtesy.
6401,"See! Antony, that revels long a-nights,"
6402,"Is notwithstanding up. Good morrow, Antony."
6403,So to most noble Caesar.
6404,Bid them prepare within.
6405,I am to blame to be thus waited for.
6406,"Now, Cinna; now, Metellus; what, Trebonius!"
6407,I have an hour’s talk in store for you:
6408,Remember that you call on me today;
6409,"Be near me, that I may remember you."
6410,"Caesar, I will. [_Aside._] and so near will I be,"
6411,That your best friends shall wish I had been further.
6412,"Good friends, go in, and taste some wine with me;"
6413,"And we, like friends, will straightway go together."
6414,The heart of Brutus yearns to think upon.
6415,SCENE III. A street near the Capitol.
6416,"Enter Artemidorus, reading a paper."
6417,"_“Caesar, beware of Brutus; take heed of Cassius; come not near Casca;"
6418,have an eye to Cinna; trust not Trebonius; mark well Metellus Cimber;
6419,Decius Brutus loves thee not; thou hast wrong’d Caius Ligarius. There
6420,"is but one mind in all these men, and it is bent against Caesar. If"
6421,"thou be’st not immortal, look about you: security gives way to"
6422,conspiracy. The mighty gods defend thee!
6423,"Thy lover, Artemidorus.”_ Here will I stand till Caesar pass along, And"
6424,as a suitor will I give him this. My heart laments that virtue cannot
6425,"live Out of the teeth of emulation. If thou read this, O Caesar, thou"
6426,"mayest live; If not, the Fates with traitors do contrive."
6427,"SCENE IV. Another part of the same street, before the house of Brutus."
6428,Enter Portia and Lucius.
6429,"I pr’ythee, boy, run to the Senate-house;"
6430,"Stay not to answer me, but get thee gone."
6431,Why dost thou stay?
6432,"To know my errand, madam."
6433,"I would have had thee there and here again,"
6434,Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there.
6435,Set a huge mountain ’tween my heart and tongue!
6436,"I have a man’s mind, but a woman’s might."
6437,How hard it is for women to keep counsel!
6438,Art thou here yet?
6439,"Madam, what should I do?"
6440,"Run to the Capitol, and nothing else?"
6441,"And so return to you, and nothing else?"
6442,"Yes, bring me word, boy, if thy lord look well,"
6443,For he went sickly forth: and take good note
6444,"What Caesar doth, what suitors press to him."
6445,"Hark, boy, what noise is that?"
6446,"I hear none, madam."
6447,"I heard a bustling rumour, like a fray,"
6448,And the wind brings it from the Capitol.
6449,"Sooth, madam, I hear nothing."
6450,Which way hast thou been?
6451,"At mine own house, good lady."
6452,"About the ninth hour, lady."
6453,Is Caesar yet gone to the Capitol?
6454,"Madam, not yet. I go to take my stand,"
6455,To see him pass on to the Capitol.
6456,"Thou hast some suit to Caesar, hast thou not?"
6457,"That I have, lady, if it will please Caesar"
6458,"To be so good to Caesar as to hear me,"
6459,I shall beseech him to befriend himself.
6460,"Why, know’st thou any harm’s intended towards him?"
6461,"None that I know will be, much that I fear may chance."
6462,Good morrow to you. Here the street is narrow.
6463,"The throng that follows Caesar at the heels,"
6464,"Of Senators, of Praetors, common suitors,"
6465,Will crowd a feeble man almost to death:
6466,"I’ll get me to a place more void, and there"
6467,Speak to great Caesar as he comes along.
6468,I must go in.
6469,"The heart of woman is! O Brutus,"
6470,The heavens speed thee in thine enterprise!
6471,"Sure, the boy heard me. Brutus hath a suit"
6472,"That Caesar will not grant. O, I grow faint."
6473,"Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord;"
6474,"Say I am merry; come to me again,"
6475,And bring me word what he doth say to thee.
6476,SCENE I. Rome. Before the Capitol; the Senate sitting.
6477,A crowd of people in the street leading to the Capitol. Flourish. Enter
6478,"Caesar, Brutus, Cassius, Casca, Decius, Metellus, Trebonius, Cinna,"
6479,"Antony, Lepidus, Artemidorus, Publius, Popilius and the Soothsayer."
6480,The Ides of March are come.
6481,"Ay, Caesar; but not gone."
6482,"Hail, Caesar! Read this schedule."
6483,"Trebonius doth desire you to o’er-read,"
6484,"At your best leisure, this his humble suit."
6485,"O Caesar, read mine first; for mine’s a suit"
6486,"That touches Caesar nearer. Read it, great Caesar."
6487,What touches us ourself shall be last serv’d.
6488,"Delay not, Caesar. Read it instantly."
6489,"What, is the fellow mad?"
6490,"What, urge you your petitions in the street?"
6491,Come to the Capitol.
6492,"Caesar enters the Capitol, the rest following. All the Senators rise."
6493,I wish your enterprise today may thrive.
6494,What said Popilius Lena?
6495,He wish’d today our enterprise might thrive.
6496,I fear our purpose is discovered.
6497,Look how he makes to Caesar: mark him.
6498,"Casca, be sudden, for we fear prevention."
6499,"Brutus, what shall be done? If this be known,"
6500,"Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back,"
6501,For I will slay myself.
6502,Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes;
6503,"For look, he smiles, and Caesar doth not change."
6504,"Trebonius knows his time, for look you, Brutus,"
6505,He draws Mark Antony out of the way.
6506,[_Exeunt Antony and Trebonius. Caesar and the Senators take their
6507,"Where is Metellus Cimber? Let him go,"
6508,And presently prefer his suit to Caesar.
6509,He is address’d; press near and second him.
6510,"Casca, you are the first that rears your hand."
6511,Are we all ready? What is now amiss
6512,That Caesar and his Senate must redress?
6513,"Most high, most mighty, and most puissant Caesar,"
6514,Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat
6515,"I must prevent thee, Cimber."
6516,These couchings and these lowly courtesies
6517,"Might fire the blood of ordinary men,"
6518,And turn pre-ordinance and first decree
6519,"Into the law of children. Be not fond,"
6520,To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood
6521,That will be thaw’d from the true quality
6522,"With that which melteth fools; I mean sweet words,"
6523,"Low-crooked curtsies, and base spaniel fawning."
6524,Thy brother by decree is banished:
6525,"If thou dost bend, and pray, and fawn for him,"
6526,I spurn thee like a cur out of my way.
6527,"Know, Caesar dost not wrong, nor without cause"
6528,Will he be satisfied.
6529,"Is there no voice more worthy than my own,"
6530,To sound more sweetly in great Caesar’s ear
6531,For the repealing of my banish’d brother?
6532,"I kiss thy hand, but not in flattery, Caesar;"
6533,Desiring thee that Publius Cimber may
6534,Have an immediate freedom of repeal.
6535,"Pardon, Caesar; Caesar, pardon:"
6536,"As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall,"
6537,To beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber.
6538,"I could be well mov’d, if I were as you;"
6539,"If I could pray to move, prayers would move me:"
6540,"But I am constant as the northern star,"
6541,Of whose true-fix’d and resting quality
6542,There is no fellow in the firmament.
6543,"The skies are painted with unnumber’d sparks,"
6544,"They are all fire, and every one doth shine;"
6545,But there’s but one in all doth hold his place.
6546,"So in the world; ’tis furnish’d well with men,"
6547,"And men are flesh and blood, and apprehensive;"
6548,Yet in the number I do know but one
6549,"That unassailable holds on his rank,"
6550,"Unshak’d of motion: and that I am he,"
6551,"Let me a little show it, even in this,"
6552,"That I was constant Cimber should be banish’d,"
6553,And constant do remain to keep him so.
6554,Hence! wilt thou lift up Olympus?
6555,Doth not Brutus bootless kneel?
6556,"Speak, hands, for me!"
6557,[_Casca stabs Caesar in the neck. Caesar catches hold of his arm. He is
6558,"then stabbed by several other Conspirators, and at last by Marcus"
6559,"_Et tu, Brute?_—Then fall, Caesar!"
6560,Liberty! Freedom! Tyranny is dead!
6561,"Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets."
6562,"Some to the common pulpits and cry out,"
6563,"“Liberty, freedom, and enfranchisement!”"
6564,"People and Senators, be not affrighted."
6565,Fly not; stand still; ambition’s debt is paid.
6566,"Go to the pulpit, Brutus."
6567,"Here, quite confounded with this mutiny."
6568,"Stand fast together, lest some friend of Caesar’s"
6569,"Talk not of standing. Publius, good cheer!"
6570,"There is no harm intended to your person,"
6571,"Nor to no Roman else. So tell them, Publius."
6572,"And leave us, Publius; lest that the people"
6573,"Rushing on us, should do your age some mischief."
6574,Do so; and let no man abide this deed
6575,But we the doers.
6576,Fled to his house amaz’d.
6577,"Men, wives, and children stare, cry out, and run,"
6578,As it were doomsday.
6579,"Fates, we will know your pleasures."
6580,"That we shall die, we know; ’tis but the time"
6581,"And drawing days out, that men stand upon."
6582,"Why, he that cuts off twenty years of life"
6583,Cuts off so many years of fearing death.
6584,"Grant that, and then is death a benefit:"
6585,"So are we Caesar’s friends, that have abridg’d"
6586,"His time of fearing death. Stoop, Romans, stoop,"
6587,And let us bathe our hands in Caesar’s blood
6588,"Up to the elbows, and besmear our swords:"
6589,"Then walk we forth, even to the market-place,"
6590,"And waving our red weapons o’er our heads,"
6591,"Let’s all cry, “Peace, freedom, and liberty!”"
6592,"Stoop then, and wash. How many ages hence"
6593,Shall this our lofty scene be acted over
6594,"In States unborn, and accents yet unknown!"
6595,"How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport,"
6596,"That now on Pompey’s basis lies along,"
6597,No worthier than the dust!
6598,"So oft as that shall be,"
6599,So often shall the knot of us be call’d
6600,The men that gave their country liberty.
6601,"What, shall we forth?"
6602,"Ay, every man away."
6603,Brutus shall lead; and we will grace his heels
6604,With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome.
6605,"Soft, who comes here? A friend of Antony’s."
6606,"Thus, Brutus, did my master bid me kneel;"
6607,Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down;
6608,"And, being prostrate, thus he bade me say:"
6609,"Brutus is noble, wise, valiant, and honest;"
6610,"Caesar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving;"
6611,Say I love Brutus and I honour him;
6612,"Say I fear’d Caesar, honour’d him, and lov’d him."
6613,If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony
6614,"May safely come to him, and be resolv’d"
6615,"How Caesar hath deserv’d to lie in death,"
6616,Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead
6617,So well as Brutus living; but will follow
6618,The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus
6619,"Thorough the hazards of this untrod state,"
6620,With all true faith. So says my master Antony.
6621,Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman;
6622,I never thought him worse.
6623,"Tell him, so please him come unto this place,"
6624,"He shall be satisfied and, by my honour,"
6625,I’ll fetch him presently.
6626,I know that we shall have him well to friend.
6627,I wish we may: but yet have I a mind
6628,That fears him much; and my misgiving still
6629,Falls shrewdly to the purpose.
6630,"But here comes Antony. Welcome, Mark Antony."
6631,O mighty Caesar! Dost thou lie so low?
6632,"Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils,"
6633,Shrunk to this little measure? Fare thee well.
6634,"I know not, gentlemen, what you intend,"
6635,"Who else must be let blood, who else is rank:"
6636,"If I myself, there is no hour so fit"
6637,As Caesar’s death’s hour; nor no instrument
6638,"Of half that worth as those your swords, made rich"
6639,With the most noble blood of all this world.
6640,"I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard,"
6641,"Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke,"
6642,"Fulfill your pleasure. Live a thousand years,"
6643,I shall not find myself so apt to die.
6644,"No place will please me so, no means of death,"
6645,"As here by Caesar, and by you cut off,"
6646,The choice and master spirits of this age.
6647,"O Antony, beg not your death of us."
6648,"Though now we must appear bloody and cruel,"
6649,As by our hands and this our present act
6650,You see we do; yet see you but our hands
6651,And this the bleeding business they have done.
6652,Our hearts you see not; they are pitiful;
6653,And pity to the general wrong of Rome—
6654,"As fire drives out fire, so pity pity—"
6655,"Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part,"
6656,"To you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony;"
6657,"Our arms in strength of malice, and our hearts"
6658,"Of brothers’ temper, do receive you in"
6659,"With all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence."
6660,Your voice shall be as strong as any man’s
6661,In the disposing of new dignities.
6662,Only be patient till we have appeas’d
6663,"The multitude, beside themselves with fear,"
6664,And then we will deliver you the cause
6665,"Why I, that did love Caesar when I struck him,"
6666,I doubt not of your wisdom.
6667,Let each man render me his bloody hand.
6668,"First, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you;"
6669,"Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand."
6670,"Now, Decius Brutus, yours; now yours, Metellus;"
6671,"Yours, Cinna; and, my valiant Casca, yours;"
6672,"Though last, not least in love, yours, good Trebonius."
6673,"Gentlemen all—alas, what shall I say?"
6674,"My credit now stands on such slippery ground,"
6675,"That one of two bad ways you must conceit me,"
6676,Either a coward or a flatterer.
6677,"That I did love thee, Caesar, O, ’tis true:"
6678,"If then thy spirit look upon us now,"
6679,"Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death,"
6680,"To see thy Antony making his peace,"
6681,"Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes,"
6682,"Most noble, in the presence of thy corse?"
6683,"Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds,"
6684,"Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood,"
6685,It would become me better than to close
6686,In terms of friendship with thine enemies.
6687,"Pardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bay’d, brave hart;"
6688,"Here didst thou fall; and here thy hunters stand,"
6689,"Sign’d in thy spoil, and crimson’d in thy lethe."
6690,"O world, thou wast the forest to this hart;"
6691,"And this indeed, O world, the heart of thee."
6692,"How like a deer strucken by many princes,"
6693,Dost thou here lie!
6694,"Pardon me, Caius Cassius:"
6695,The enemies of Caesar shall say this;
6696,"Then, in a friend, it is cold modesty."
6697,I blame you not for praising Caesar so;
6698,But what compact mean you to have with us?
6699,"Will you be prick’d in number of our friends,"
6700,"Or shall we on, and not depend on you?"
6701,Therefore I took your hands; but was indeed
6702,"Sway’d from the point, by looking down on Caesar."
6703,"Friends am I with you all, and love you all,"
6704,"Upon this hope, that you shall give me reasons"
6705,"Why, and wherein, Caesar was dangerous."
6706,Or else were this a savage spectacle.
6707,Our reasons are so full of good regard
6708,"That were you, Antony, the son of Caesar,"
6709,You should be satisfied.
6710,"That’s all I seek,"
6711,And am moreover suitor that I may
6712,Produce his body to the market-place;
6713,"And in the pulpit, as becomes a friend,"
6714,Speak in the order of his funeral.
6715,"You shall, Mark Antony."
6716,"Brutus, a word with you."
6717,That Antony speak in his funeral.
6718,Know you how much the people may be mov’d
6719,By that which he will utter?
6720,"I will myself into the pulpit first,"
6721,And show the reason of our Caesar’s death.
6722,"What Antony shall speak, I will protest"
6723,He speaks by leave and by permission;
6724,And that we are contented Caesar shall
6725,Have all true rights and lawful ceremonies.
6726,It shall advantage more than do us wrong.
6727,"Mark Antony, here, take you Caesar’s body."
6728,"You shall not in your funeral speech blame us,"
6729,"But speak all good you can devise of Caesar,"
6730,And say you do’t by our permission;
6731,Else shall you not have any hand at all
6732,About his funeral. And you shall speak
6733,"In the same pulpit whereto I am going,"
6734,After my speech is ended.
6735,I do desire no more.
6736,"Prepare the body, then, and follow us."
6737,"O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,"
6738,That I am meek and gentle with these butchers.
6739,Thou art the ruins of the noblest man
6740,That ever lived in the tide of times.
6741,Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!
6742,"Over thy wounds now do I prophesy,"
6743,"Which, like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips"
6744,"To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue,"
6745,A curse shall light upon the limbs of men;
6746,Domestic fury and fierce civil strife
6747,Shall cumber all the parts of Italy;
6748,"Blood and destruction shall be so in use,"
6749,"And dreadful objects so familiar,"
6750,That mothers shall but smile when they behold
6751,Their infants quartered with the hands of war;
6752,All pity chok’d with custom of fell deeds:
6753,"And Caesar’s spirit, ranging for revenge,"
6754,"With Ate by his side come hot from Hell,"
6755,Shall in these confines with a monarch’s voice
6756,"Cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war,"
6757,That this foul deed shall smell above the earth
6758,"With carrion men, groaning for burial."
6759,"You serve Octavius Caesar, do you not?"
6760,"I do, Mark Antony."
6761,Caesar did write for him to come to Rome.
6762,"He did receive his letters, and is coming,"
6763,"And bid me say to you by word of mouth,—"
6764,"Thy heart is big, get thee apart and weep."
6765,"Passion, I see, is catching; for mine eyes,"
6766,"Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine,"
6767,Began to water. Is thy master coming?
6768,He lies tonight within seven leagues of Rome.
6769,"Post back with speed, and tell him what hath chanc’d."
6770,"Here is a mourning Rome, a dangerous Rome,"
6771,No Rome of safety for Octavius yet.
6772,"Hie hence, and tell him so. Yet stay awhile;"
6773,Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corse
6774,"Into the market-place: there shall I try,"
6775,"In my oration, how the people take"
6776,The cruel issue of these bloody men;
6777,According to the which thou shalt discourse
6778,To young Octavius of the state of things.
6779,Lend me your hand.
6780,SCENE II. The same. The Forum.
6781,"Enter Brutus and goes into the pulpit, and Cassius, with a throng of"
6782,We will be satisfied; let us be satisfied.
6783,"Then follow me, and give me audience, friends."
6784,"Cassius, go you into the other street"
6785,And part the numbers.
6786,"Those that will hear me speak, let ’em stay here;"
6787,"Those that will follow Cassius, go with him;"
6788,And public reasons shall be rendered
6789,I will hear Brutus speak.
6790,"I will hear Cassius; and compare their reasons,"
6791,When severally we hear them rendered.
6792,"[_Exit Cassius, with some of the Citizens. Brutus goes into the"
6793,The noble Brutus is ascended: silence!
6794,Be patient till the last.
6795,"Romans, countrymen, and lovers, hear me for my cause; and be silent,"
6796,"that you may hear. Believe me for mine honour, and have respect to mine"
6797,"honour, that you may believe. Censure me in your wisdom, and awake your"
6798,"senses, that you may the better judge. If there be any in this"
6799,"assembly, any dear friend of Caesar’s, to him I say that Brutus’ love"
6800,to Caesar was no less than his. If then that friend demand why Brutus
6801,"rose against Caesar, this is my answer: Not that I loved Caesar less,"
6802,"but that I loved Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living, and die"
6803,"all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live all free men? As Caesar"
6804,"loved me, I weep for him; as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he"
6805,"was valiant, I honour him; but, as he was ambitious, I slew him. There"
6806,"is tears, for his love; joy for his fortune; honour for his valour; and"
6807,"death, for his ambition. Who is here so base, that would be a bondman?"
6808,"If any, speak; for him have I offended. Who is here so rude, that would"
6809,"not be a Roman? If any, speak; for him have I offended. Who is here so"
6810,"vile, that will not love his country? If any, speak; for him have I"
6811,offended. I pause for a reply.
6812,Then none have I offended. I have done no more to Caesar than you shall
6813,"do to Brutus. The question of his death is enroll’d in the Capitol, his"
6814,"glory not extenuated, wherein he was worthy; nor his offences enforc’d,"
6815,for which he suffered death.
6816,"Enter Antony and others, with Caesar’s body."
6817,"Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony, who, though he had no hand"
6818,"in his death, shall receive the benefit of his dying, a place in the"
6819,"commonwealth; as which of you shall not? With this I depart, that, as I"
6820,"slew my best lover for the good of Rome, I have the same dagger for"
6821,"myself, when it shall please my country to need my death."
6822,"Live, Brutus! live, live!"
6823,Bring him with triumph home unto his house.
6824,Give him a statue with his ancestors.
6825,Let him be Caesar.
6826,Shall be crown’d in Brutus.
6827,We’ll bring him to his house with shouts and clamours.
6828,Peace! Silence! Brutus speaks.
6829,"Good countrymen, let me depart alone,"
6830,"And, for my sake, stay here with Antony."
6831,"Do grace to Caesar’s corpse, and grace his speech"
6832,"Tending to Caesar’s glories, which Mark Antony,"
6833,"By our permission, is allow’d to make."
6834,"I do entreat you, not a man depart,"
6835,"Save I alone, till Antony have spoke."
6836,"Stay, ho! and let us hear Mark Antony."
6837,Let him go up into the public chair.
6838,"We’ll hear him. Noble Antony, go up."
6839,"For Brutus’ sake, I am beholding to you."
6840,What does he say of Brutus?
6841,"He says, for Brutus’ sake"
6842,He finds himself beholding to us all.
6843,’Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here!
6844,This Caesar was a tyrant.
6845,We are blest that Rome is rid of him.
6846,Peace! let us hear what Antony can say.
6847,"Peace, ho! let us hear him."
6848,"Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;"
6849,"I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him."
6850,"The evil that men do lives after them,"
6851,The good is oft interred with their bones;
6852,So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus
6853,Hath told you Caesar was ambitious.
6854,"If it were so, it was a grievous fault,"
6855,And grievously hath Caesar answer’d it.
6856,"Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest,"
6857,"For Brutus is an honourable man,"
6858,"So are they all, all honourable men,"
6859,Come I to speak in Caesar’s funeral.
6860,"He was my friend, faithful and just to me;"
6861,"But Brutus says he was ambitious,"
6862,And Brutus is an honourable man.
6863,"He hath brought many captives home to Rome,"
6864,Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:
6865,Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?
6866,"When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept;"
6867,Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:
6868,Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
6869,And Brutus is an honourable man.
6870,You all did see that on the Lupercal
6871,"I thrice presented him a kingly crown,"
6872,Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition?
6873,Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
6874,And sure he is an honourable man.
6875,"I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,"
6876,But here I am to speak what I do know.
6877,"You all did love him once, not without cause;"
6878,What cause withholds you then to mourn for him?
6879,"O judgement, thou art fled to brutish beasts,"
6880,And men have lost their reason. Bear with me.
6881,"My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,"
6882,And I must pause till it come back to me.
6883,Methinks there is much reason in his sayings.
6884,"If thou consider rightly of the matter,"
6885,Caesar has had great wrong.
6886,I fear there will a worse come in his place.
6887,Mark’d ye his words? He would not take the crown;
6888,Therefore ’tis certain he was not ambitious.
6889,"If it be found so, some will dear abide it."
6890,"Poor soul, his eyes are red as fire with weeping."
6891,There’s not a nobler man in Rome than Antony.
6892,Now mark him; he begins again to speak.
6893,But yesterday the word of Caesar might
6894,"Have stood against the world; now lies he there,"
6895,And none so poor to do him reverence.
6896,O masters! If I were dispos’d to stir
6897,"Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,"
6898,"I should do Brutus wrong and Cassius wrong,"
6899,"Who, you all know, are honourable men."
6900,I will not do them wrong; I rather choose
6901,"To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you,"
6902,Than I will wrong such honourable men.
6903,"But here’s a parchment with the seal of Caesar,"
6904,I found it in his closet; ’tis his will:
6905,"Let but the commons hear this testament,"
6906,"Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read,"
6907,"And they would go and kiss dead Caesar’s wounds,"
6908,And dip their napkins in his sacred blood;
6909,"Yea, beg a hair of him for memory,"
6910,"And, dying, mention it within their wills,"
6911,Bequeathing it as a rich legacy
6912,"We’ll hear the will. Read it, Mark Antony."
6913,"The will, the will! We will hear Caesar’s will."
6914,"Have patience, gentle friends, I must not read it."
6915,It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you.
6916,"You are not wood, you are not stones, but men;"
6917,"And being men, hearing the will of Caesar,"
6918,"It will inflame you, it will make you mad."
6919,’Tis good you know not that you are his heirs;
6920,"For if you should, O, what would come of it?"
6921,"Read the will! We’ll hear it, Antony;"
6922,"You shall read us the will, Caesar’s will!"
6923,Will you be patient? Will you stay awhile?
6924,I have o’ershot myself to tell you of it.
6925,I fear I wrong the honourable men
6926,Whose daggers have stabb’d Caesar; I do fear it.
6927,They were traitors. Honourable men!
6928,The will! The testament!
6929,"They were villains, murderers. The will! Read the will!"
6930,You will compel me then to read the will?
6931,"Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar,"
6932,And let me show you him that made the will.
6933,Shall I descend? and will you give me leave?
6934,You shall have leave.
6935,A ring! Stand round.
6936,"Stand from the hearse, stand from the body."
6937,"Room for Antony, most noble Antony!"
6938,"Nay, press not so upon me; stand far off."
6939,Stand back; room! bear back.
6940,"If you have tears, prepare to shed them now."
6941,You all do know this mantle. I remember
6942,The first time ever Caesar put it on;
6943,"’Twas on a Summer’s evening, in his tent,"
6944,That day he overcame the Nervii.
6945,"Look, in this place ran Cassius’ dagger through:"
6946,See what a rent the envious Casca made:
6947,Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabb’d;
6948,"And as he pluck’d his cursed steel away,"
6949,"Mark how the blood of Caesar follow’d it,"
6950,"As rushing out of doors, to be resolv’d"
6951,"If Brutus so unkindly knock’d, or no;"
6952,"For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar’s angel."
6953,"Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar lov’d him."
6954,This was the most unkindest cut of all;
6955,"For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,"
6956,"Ingratitude, more strong than traitors’ arms,"
6957,Quite vanquish’d him: then burst his mighty heart;
6958,"And in his mantle muffling up his face,"
6959,Even at the base of Pompey’s statue
6960,"Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell."
6961,"O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!"
6962,"Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,"
6963,Whilst bloody treason flourish’d over us.
6964,"O, now you weep; and I perceive you feel"
6965,The dint of pity. These are gracious drops.
6966,"Kind souls, what weep you when you but behold"
6967,"Our Caesar’s vesture wounded? Look you here,"
6968,"Here is himself, marr’d, as you see, with traitors."
6969,O most bloody sight!
6970,We will be revenged.
6971,"Revenge,—about,—seek,—burn,—fire,—kill,—slay,—let not a traitor live!"
6972,Peace there! Hear the noble Antony.
6973,"We’ll hear him, we’ll follow him, we’ll die with him."
6974,"Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up"
6975,To such a sudden flood of mutiny.
6976,They that have done this deed are honourable.
6977,"What private griefs they have, alas, I know not,"
6978,"That made them do it. They’re wise and honourable,"
6979,"And will, no doubt, with reasons answer you."
6980,"I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts."
6981,"I am no orator, as Brutus is;"
6982,"But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man,"
6983,That love my friend; and that they know full well
6984,That gave me public leave to speak of him.
6985,"For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,"
6986,"Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech,"
6987,To stir men’s blood. I only speak right on.
6988,"I tell you that which you yourselves do know,"
6989,"Show you sweet Caesar’s wounds, poor poor dumb mouths,"
6990,"And bid them speak for me. But were I Brutus,"
6991,"And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony"
6992,"Would ruffle up your spirits, and put a tongue"
6993,"In every wound of Caesar, that should move"
6994,The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.
6995,We’ll burn the house of Brutus.
6996,"Away, then! come, seek the conspirators."
6997,"Yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak."
6998,"Peace, ho! Hear Antony; most noble Antony."
6999,"Why, friends, you go to do you know not what."
7000,Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves?
7001,"Alas, you know not; I must tell you then."
7002,You have forgot the will I told you of.
7003,"Most true; the will!—let’s stay, and hear the will."
7004,"Here is the will, and under Caesar’s seal."
7005,"To every Roman citizen he gives,"
7006,"To every several man, seventy-five drachmas."
7007,Most noble Caesar! We’ll revenge his death.
7008,Hear me with patience.
7009,"Moreover, he hath left you all his walks,"
7010,"His private arbors, and new-planted orchards,"
7011,"On this side Tiber; he hath left them you,"
7012,"And to your heirs forever; common pleasures,"
7013,"To walk abroad, and recreate yourselves."
7014,Here was a Caesar! when comes such another?
7015,"Never, never. Come, away, away!"
7016,"We’ll burn his body in the holy place,"
7017,And with the brands fire the traitors’ houses.
7018,Take up the body.
7019,"Pluck down forms, windows, anything."
7020,"Now let it work. Mischief, thou art afoot,"
7021,Take thou what course thou wilt!
7022,"Sir, Octavius is already come to Rome."
7023,He and Lepidus are at Caesar’s house.
7024,And thither will I straight to visit him.
7025,"He comes upon a wish. Fortune is merry,"
7026,And in this mood will give us anything.
7027,I heard him say Brutus and Cassius
7028,Are rid like madmen through the gates of Rome.
7029,"Belike they had some notice of the people,"
7030,How I had moved them. Bring me to Octavius.
7031,SCENE III. The same. A street.
7032,"Enter Cinna, the poet, and after him the citizens."
7033,"I dreamt tonight that I did feast with Caesar,"
7034,And things unluckily charge my fantasy.
7035,"I have no will to wander forth of doors,"
7036,Yet something leads me forth.
7037,What is your name?
7038,Whither are you going?
7039,Where do you dwell?
7040,Are you a married man or a bachelor?
7041,Answer every man directly.
7042,"Ay, and truly, you were best."
7043,What is my name? Whither am I going? Where do I dwell? Am I a married
7044,"man or a bachelor? Then, to answer every man directly and briefly,"
7045,wisely and truly. Wisely I say I am a bachelor.
7046,That’s as much as to say they are fools that marry; you’ll bear me a
7047,"bang for that, I fear. Proceed, directly."
7048,"Directly, I am going to Caesar’s funeral."
7049,"As a friend, or an enemy?"
7050,That matter is answered directly.
7051,"For your dwelling, briefly."
7052,"Briefly, I dwell by the Capitol."
7053,"Your name, sir, truly."
7054,"Truly, my name is Cinna."
7055,Tear him to pieces! He’s a conspirator.
7056,"I am Cinna the poet, I am Cinna the poet."
7057,"Tear him for his bad verses, tear him for his bad verses."
7058,I am not Cinna the conspirator.
7059,"It is no matter, his name’s Cinna; pluck but his name out of his heart,"
7060,and turn him going.
7061,"Tear him, tear him! Come; brands, ho! firebrands. To Brutus’, to"
7062,"Cassius’; burn all. Some to Decius’ house, and some to Casca’s, some to"
7063,SCENE I. Rome. A room in Antony’s house.
7064,"Enter Antony, Octavius and Lepidus, seated at a table."
7065,These many then shall die; their names are prick’d.
7066,"Your brother too must die; consent you, Lepidus?"
7067,"Prick him down, Antony."
7068,"Upon condition Publius shall not live,"
7069,"Who is your sister’s son, Mark Antony."
7070,"He shall not live; look, with a spot I damn him."
7071,"But, Lepidus, go you to Caesar’s house;"
7072,"Fetch the will hither, and we shall determine"
7073,How to cut off some charge in legacies.
7074,"What, shall I find you here?"
7075,"Or here, or at the Capitol."
7076,"This is a slight unmeritable man,"
7077,"Meet to be sent on errands. Is it fit,"
7078,"The three-fold world divided, he should stand"
7079,One of the three to share it?
7080,"So you thought him,"
7081,And took his voice who should be prick’d to die
7082,In our black sentence and proscription.
7083,"Octavius, I have seen more days than you;"
7084,"And though we lay these honours on this man,"
7085,"To ease ourselves of divers sland’rous loads,"
7086,"He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold,"
7087,"To groan and sweat under the business,"
7088,"Either led or driven, as we point the way;"
7089,"And having brought our treasure where we will,"
7090,"Then take we down his load, and turn him off,"
7091,"Like to the empty ass, to shake his ears,"
7092,And graze in commons.
7093,You may do your will;
7094,But he’s a tried and valiant soldier.
7095,"So is my horse, Octavius; and for that"
7096,I do appoint him store of provender.
7097,"It is a creature that I teach to fight,"
7098,"To wind, to stop, to run directly on,"
7099,His corporal motion govern’d by my spirit.
7100,"And, in some taste, is Lepidus but so:"
7101,"He must be taught, and train’d, and bid go forth:"
7102,A barren-spirited fellow; one that feeds
7103,"On objects, arts, and imitations,"
7104,"Which, out of use and stal’d by other men,"
7105,Begin his fashion. Do not talk of him
7106,"But as a property. And now, Octavius,"
7107,Listen great things. Brutus and Cassius
7108,Are levying powers; we must straight make head.
7109,"Therefore let our alliance be combin’d,"
7110,"Our best friends made, our means stretch’d;"
7111,"And let us presently go sit in council,"
7112,"How covert matters may be best disclos’d,"
7113,And open perils surest answered.
7114,"Let us do so: for we are at the stake,"
7115,And bay’d about with many enemies;
7116,"And some that smile have in their hearts, I fear,"
7117,"SCENE II. Before Brutus’ tent, in the camp near Sardis."
7118,"Drum. Enter Brutus, Lucilius, Titinius and Soldiers; Pindarus meeting"
7119,them; Lucius at some distance.
7120,"Give the word, ho! and stand."
7121,"What now, Lucilius! is Cassius near?"
7122,"He is at hand, and Pindarus is come"
7123,To do you salutation from his master.
7124,"He greets me well. Your master, Pindarus,"
7125,"In his own change, or by ill officers,"
7126,Hath given me some worthy cause to wish
7127,"Things done, undone: but, if he be at hand,"
7128,I shall be satisfied.
7129,I do not doubt
7130,But that my noble master will appear
7131,"Such as he is, full of regard and honour."
7132,"He is not doubted. A word, Lucilius;"
7133,"How he received you, let me be resolv’d."
7134,"With courtesy and with respect enough,"
7135,"But not with such familiar instances,"
7136,"Nor with such free and friendly conference,"
7137,As he hath us’d of old.
7138,"A hot friend cooling. Ever note, Lucilius,"
7139,When love begins to sicken and decay
7140,It useth an enforced ceremony.
7141,There are no tricks in plain and simple faith;
7142,"But hollow men, like horses hot at hand,"
7143,Make gallant show and promise of their mettle;
7144,"But when they should endure the bloody spur,"
7145,"They fall their crests, and like deceitful jades"
7146,Sink in the trial. Comes his army on?
7147,They meant this night in Sardis to be quarter’d;
7148,"The greater part, the horse in general,"
7149,Are come with Cassius.
7150,Enter Cassius and Soldiers.
7151,Hark! he is arriv’d.
7152,March gently on to meet him.
7153,"Stand, ho! Speak the word along."
7154,"Most noble brother, you have done me wrong."
7155,"Judge me, you gods; wrong I mine enemies?"
7156,"And if not so, how should I wrong a brother?"
7157,"Brutus, this sober form of yours hides wrongs;"
7158,And when you do them—
7159,"Speak your griefs softly, I do know you well."
7160,"Before the eyes of both our armies here,"
7161,"Which should perceive nothing but love from us,"
7162,Let us not wrangle. Bid them move away;
7163,"Then in my tent, Cassius, enlarge your griefs,"
7164,And I will give you audience.
7165,Bid our commanders lead their charges off
7166,A little from this ground.
7167,"Lucilius, do you the like; and let no man"
7168,Come to our tent till we have done our conference.
7169,"Lucius and Titinius, guard our door."
7170,SCENE III. Within the tent of Brutus.
7171,Enter Brutus and Cassius.
7172,That you have wrong’d me doth appear in this:
7173,You have condemn’d and noted Lucius Pella
7174,For taking bribes here of the Sardians;
7175,"Wherein my letters, praying on his side"
7176,"Because I knew the man, were slighted off."
7177,You wrong’d yourself to write in such a case.
7178,In such a time as this it is not meet
7179,That every nice offence should bear his comment.
7180,"Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself"
7181,"Are much condemn’d to have an itching palm,"
7182,To sell and mart your offices for gold
7183,I an itching palm!
7184,"You know that you are Brutus that speak this,"
7185,"Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last."
7186,"The name of Cassius honours this corruption,"
7187,And chastisement doth therefore hide his head.
7188,"Remember March, the Ides of March remember:"
7189,Did not great Julius bleed for justice’ sake?
7190,"What villain touch’d his body, that did stab,"
7191,"And not for justice? What! Shall one of us,"
7192,That struck the foremost man of all this world
7193,"But for supporting robbers, shall we now"
7194,"Contaminate our fingers with base bribes,"
7195,And sell the mighty space of our large honours
7196,For so much trash as may be grasped thus?
7197,"I had rather be a dog, and bay the moon,"
7198,Than such a Roman.
7199,"Brutus, bait not me,"
7200,"I’ll not endure it. You forget yourself,"
7201,"To hedge me in. I am a soldier, I,"
7202,"Older in practice, abler than yourself"
7203,"Go to; you are not, Cassius."
7204,I say you are not.
7205,"Urge me no more, I shall forget myself;"
7206,"Have mind upon your health, tempt me no farther."
7207,"Hear me, for I will speak."
7208,Must I give way and room to your rash choler?
7209,Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?
7210,"O ye gods, ye gods! Must I endure all this?"
7211,"All this? ay, more: fret till your proud heart break;"
7212,"Go show your slaves how choleric you are,"
7213,And make your bondmen tremble. Must I budge?
7214,Must I observe you? Must I stand and crouch
7215,"Under your testy humour? By the gods,"
7216,"You shall digest the venom of your spleen,"
7217,"Though it do split you; for, from this day forth,"
7218,"I’ll use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter,"
7219,When you are waspish.
7220,Is it come to this?
7221,You say you are a better soldier:
7222,"Let it appear so; make your vaunting true,"
7223,"And it shall please me well. For mine own part,"
7224,I shall be glad to learn of noble men.
7225,"You wrong me every way, you wrong me, Brutus."
7226,"I said, an elder soldier, not a better:"
7227,Did I say better?
7228,"If you did, I care not."
7229,"When Caesar liv’d, he durst not thus have mov’d me."
7230,"Peace, peace! you durst not so have tempted him."
7231,What? durst not tempt him?
7232,For your life you durst not.
7233,Do not presume too much upon my love.
7234,I may do that I shall be sorry for.
7235,You have done that you should be sorry for.
7236,"There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats,"
7237,"For I am arm’d so strong in honesty,"
7238,"That they pass by me as the idle wind,"
7239,Which I respect not. I did send to you
7240,"For certain sums of gold, which you denied me;"
7241,For I can raise no money by vile means:
7242,"By Heaven, I had rather coin my heart,"
7243,"And drop my blood for drachmas, than to wring"
7244,From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash
7245,By any indirection. I did send
7246,"To you for gold to pay my legions,"
7247,Which you denied me: was that done like Cassius?
7248,Should I have answer’d Caius Cassius so?
7249,"When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous,"
7250,"To lock such rascal counters from his friends,"
7251,"Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts,"
7252,Dash him to pieces!
7253,I denied you not.
7254,I did not. He was but a fool
7255,That brought my answer back. Brutus hath riv’d my heart.
7256,A friend should bear his friend’s infirmities;
7257,But Brutus makes mine greater than they are.
7258,"I do not, till you practise them on me."
7259,You love me not.
7260,I do not like your faults.
7261,A friendly eye could never see such faults.
7262,"A flatterer’s would not, though they do appear"
7263,As huge as high Olympus.
7264,"Come, Antony, and young Octavius, come,"
7265,"Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius,"
7266,For Cassius is a-weary of the world:
7267,Hated by one he loves; brav’d by his brother;
7268,"Check’d like a bondman; all his faults observ’d,"
7269,"Set in a note-book, learn’d and conn’d by rote,"
7270,"To cast into my teeth. O, I could weep"
7271,"My spirit from mine eyes! There is my dagger,"
7272,"And here my naked breast; within, a heart"
7273,"Dearer than Plutus’ mine, richer than gold:"
7274,"If that thou be’st a Roman, take it forth."
7275,"I, that denied thee gold, will give my heart:"
7276,"Strike as thou didst at Caesar; for I know,"
7277,"When thou didst hate him worst, thou lovedst him better"
7278,Than ever thou lovedst Cassius.
7279,"Be angry when you will, it shall have scope;"
7280,"Do what you will, dishonour shall be humour."
7281,"O Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb"
7282,"That carries anger as the flint bears fire,"
7283,"Who, much enforced, shows a hasty spark,"
7284,And straight is cold again.
7285,"To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus,"
7286,When grief and blood ill-temper’d vexeth him?
7287,"When I spoke that, I was ill-temper’d too."
7288,Do you confess so much? Give me your hand.
7289,And my heart too.
7290,"Have not you love enough to bear with me,"
7291,When that rash humour which my mother gave me
7292,"Yes, Cassius; and from henceforth,"
7293,"When you are over-earnest with your Brutus,"
7294,"He’ll think your mother chides, and leave you so."
7295,"Enter Poet, followed by Lucilius, Titinius and Lucius."
7296,There is some grudge between ’em; ’tis not meet
7297,How now! What’s the matter?
7298,"For shame, you generals! What do you mean?"
7299,"Love, and be friends, as two such men should be;"
7300,"For I have seen more years, I’m sure, than ye."
7301,"Ha, ha! How vilely doth this cynic rhyme!"
7302,"Get you hence, sirrah. Saucy fellow, hence!"
7303,"Bear with him, Brutus; ’tis his fashion."
7304,I’ll know his humour when he knows his time.
7305,What should the wars do with these jigging fools?
7306,"Away, away, be gone!"
7307,"Lucilius and Titinius, bid the commanders"
7308,Prepare to lodge their companies tonight.
7309,And come yourselves and bring Messala with you
7310,"Lucius, a bowl of wine."
7311,I did not think you could have been so angry.
7312,"O Cassius, I am sick of many griefs."
7313,"Of your philosophy you make no use,"
7314,If you give place to accidental evils.
7315,No man bears sorrow better. Portia is dead.
7316,"How ’scap’d I killing, when I cross’d you so?"
7317,O insupportable and touching loss!
7318,"Impatient of my absence,"
7319,And grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony
7320,Have made themselves so strong; for with her death
7321,"That tidings came. With this she fell distract,"
7322,"And, her attendants absent, swallow’d fire."
7323,O ye immortal gods!
7324,"Enter Lucius, with wine and a taper."
7325,Speak no more of her. Give me a bowl of wine.
7326,"In this I bury all unkindness, Cassius."
7327,My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge.
7328,"Fill, Lucius, till the wine o’erswell the cup."
7329,I cannot drink too much of Brutus’ love.
7330,Enter Titinius and Messala.
7331,"Now sit we close about this taper here,"
7332,And call in question our necessities.
7333,"Portia, art thou gone?"
7334,"No more, I pray you."
7335,"Messala, I have here received letters,"
7336,That young Octavius and Mark Antony
7337,"Come down upon us with a mighty power,"
7338,Bending their expedition toward Philippi.
7339,Myself have letters of the selfsame tenor.
7340,That by proscription and bills of outlawry
7341,"Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus"
7342,Have put to death an hundred Senators.
7343,Therein our letters do not well agree.
7344,Mine speak of seventy Senators that died
7345,"By their proscriptions, Cicero being one."
7346,And by that order of proscription.
7347,"Had you your letters from your wife, my lord?"
7348,Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?
7349,"That, methinks, is strange."
7350,Why ask you? Hear you aught of her in yours?
7351,"Now as you are a Roman, tell me true."
7352,"Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell,"
7353,"For certain she is dead, and by strange manner."
7354,"Why, farewell, Portia. We must die, Messala."
7355,"With meditating that she must die once,"
7356,I have the patience to endure it now.
7357,Even so great men great losses should endure.
7358,"I have as much of this in art as you,"
7359,But yet my nature could not bear it so.
7360,"Well, to our work alive. What do you think"
7361,Of marching to Philippi presently?
7362,I do not think it good.
7363,’Tis better that the enemy seek us;
7364,"So shall he waste his means, weary his soldiers,"
7365,"Doing himself offence, whilst we, lying still,"
7366,"Are full of rest, defence, and nimbleness."
7367,Good reasons must of force give place to better.
7368,The people ’twixt Philippi and this ground
7369,Do stand but in a forced affection;
7370,For they have grudg’d us contribution.
7371,"The enemy, marching along by them,"
7372,"By them shall make a fuller number up,"
7373,"Come on refresh’d, new-added, and encourag’d;"
7374,From which advantage shall we cut him off
7375,"If at Philippi we do face him there,"
7376,These people at our back.
7377,"Hear me, good brother."
7378,"Under your pardon. You must note besides,"
7379,"That we have tried the utmost of our friends,"
7380,"Our legions are brim-full, our cause is ripe."
7381,The enemy increaseth every day;
7382,"We, at the height, are ready to decline."
7383,"There is a tide in the affairs of men,"
7384,"Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;"
7385,"Omitted, all the voyage of their life"
7386,Is bound in shallows and in miseries.
7387,"On such a full sea are we now afloat,"
7388,"And we must take the current when it serves,"
7389,Or lose our ventures.
7390,"Then, with your will, go on:"
7391,"We’ll along ourselves, and meet them at Philippi."
7392,"The deep of night is crept upon our talk,"
7393,"And nature must obey necessity,"
7394,Which we will niggard with a little rest.
7395,There is no more to say?
7396,No more. Good night:
7397,"Early tomorrow will we rise, and hence."
7398,"Farewell now, good Messala."
7399,"Good night, Titinius. Noble, noble Cassius,"
7400,"Good night, and good repose."
7401,O my dear brother!
7402,This was an ill beginning of the night.
7403,Never come such division ’tween our souls!
7404,"Let it not, Brutus."
7405,Enter Lucius with the gown.
7406,"Good night, my lord."
7407,"Good night, good brother."
7408,"Good night, Lord Brutus."
7409,Give me the gown. Where is thy instrument?
7410,Here in the tent.
7411,"What, thou speak’st drowsily?"
7412,"Poor knave, I blame thee not, thou art o’er-watch’d."
7413,Call Claudius and some other of my men;
7414,I’ll have them sleep on cushions in my tent.
7415,Enter Varro and Claudius.
7416,"I pray you, sirs, lie in my tent and sleep;"
7417,It may be I shall raise you by-and-by
7418,On business to my brother Cassius.
7419,"So please you, we will stand and watch your pleasure."
7420,"I will not have it so; lie down, good sirs,"
7421,It may be I shall otherwise bethink me.
7422,"Look, Lucius, here’s the book I sought for so;"
7423,I put it in the pocket of my gown.
7424,I was sure your lordship did not give it me.
7425,"Bear with me, good boy, I am much forgetful."
7426,"Canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile,"
7427,And touch thy instrument a strain or two?
7428,"Ay, my lord, an’t please you."
7429,"It does, my boy."
7430,"I trouble thee too much, but thou art willing."
7431,"It is my duty, sir."
7432,I should not urge thy duty past thy might;
7433,I know young bloods look for a time of rest.
7434,"I have slept, my lord, already."
7435,"It was well done, and thou shalt sleep again;"
7436,"I will not hold thee long. If I do live,"
7437,I will be good to thee.
7438,"This is a sleepy tune. O murd’rous slumber,"
7439,"Layest thou thy leaden mace upon my boy,"
7440,"That plays thee music? Gentle knave, good night;"
7441,I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee.
7442,"If thou dost nod, thou break’st thy instrument;"
7443,"I’ll take it from thee; and, good boy, good night."
7444,"Let me see, let me see; is not the leaf turn’d down"
7445,"Where I left reading? Here it is, I think."
7446,Enter the Ghost of Caesar.
7447,How ill this taper burns! Ha! who comes here?
7448,I think it is the weakness of mine eyes
7449,That shapes this monstrous apparition.
7450,It comes upon me. Art thou anything?
7451,"Art thou some god, some angel, or some devil,"
7452,That mak’st my blood cold and my hair to stare?
7453,Speak to me what thou art.
7454,"Thy evil spirit, Brutus."
7455,To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi.
7456,Well; then I shall see thee again?
7457,"Why, I will see thee at Philippi then."
7458,"Now I have taken heart, thou vanishest."
7459,"Ill spirit, I would hold more talk with thee."
7460,"Boy! Lucius! Varro! Claudius! Sirs, awake! Claudius!"
7461,"The strings, my lord, are false."
7462,He thinks he still is at his instrument.
7463,"Didst thou dream, Lucius, that thou so criedst out?"
7464,"My lord, I do not know that I did cry."
7465,"Yes, that thou didst. Didst thou see anything?"
7466,"Sleep again, Lucius. Sirrah Claudius!"
7467,"Why did you so cry out, sirs, in your sleep?"
7468,"Did we, my lord?"
7469,Ay. Saw you anything?
7470,"No, my lord, I saw nothing."
7471,"Nor I, my lord."
7472,Go and commend me to my brother Cassius;
7473,"Bid him set on his powers betimes before,"
7474,And we will follow.
7475,"It shall be done, my lord."
7476,SCENE I. The plains of Philippi.
7477,"Enter Octavius, Antony and their Army."
7478,"Now, Antony, our hopes are answered."
7479,"You said the enemy would not come down,"
7480,But keep the hills and upper regions.
7481,"It proves not so; their battles are at hand,"
7482,"They mean to warn us at Philippi here,"
7483,Answering before we do demand of them.
7484,"Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know"
7485,Wherefore they do it. They could be content
7486,"To visit other places, and come down"
7487,"With fearful bravery, thinking by this face"
7488,To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage;
7489,But ’tis not so.
7490,The enemy comes on in gallant show;
7491,"Their bloody sign of battle is hung out,"
7492,And something to be done immediately.
7493,"Octavius, lead your battle softly on"
7494,Upon the left hand of the even field.
7495,Upon the right hand I. Keep thou the left.
7496,Why do you cross me in this exigent?
7497,I do not cross you; but I will do so.
7498,"Drum. Enter Brutus, Cassius and their Army; Lucilius, Titinius, Messala"
7499,"They stand, and would have parley."
7500,"Stand fast, Titinius; we must out and talk."
7501,"Mark Antony, shall we give sign of battle?"
7502,"No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge."
7503,Make forth; the generals would have some words.
7504,Stir not until the signal.
7505,"Words before blows: is it so, countrymen?"
7506,"Not that we love words better, as you do."
7507,"Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius."
7508,"In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words;"
7509,"Witness the hole you made in Caesar’s heart,"
7510,"Crying, “Long live! Hail, Caesar!”"
7511,The posture of your blows are yet unknown;
7512,"But for your words, they rob the Hybla bees,"
7513,And leave them honeyless.
7514,"O yes, and soundless too,"
7515,"For you have stol’n their buzzing, Antony,"
7516,And very wisely threat before you sting.
7517,"Villains, you did not so when your vile daggers"
7518,Hack’d one another in the sides of Caesar:
7519,"You show’d your teeth like apes, and fawn’d like hounds,"
7520,"And bow’d like bondmen, kissing Caesar’s feet;"
7521,"Whilst damned Casca, like a cur, behind"
7522,Struck Caesar on the neck. O you flatterers!
7523,"Flatterers! Now, Brutus, thank yourself."
7524,"This tongue had not offended so today,"
7525,If Cassius might have rul’d.
7526,"Come, come, the cause. If arguing makes us sweat,"
7527,The proof of it will turn to redder drops.
7528,"Look, I draw a sword against conspirators."
7529,When think you that the sword goes up again?
7530,"Never, till Caesar’s three and thirty wounds"
7531,Be well aveng’d; or till another Caesar
7532,Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors.
7533,"Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors’ hands,"
7534,Unless thou bring’st them with thee.
7535,I was not born to die on Brutus’ sword.
7536,"O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain,"
7537,"Young man, thou couldst not die more honourable."
7538,"A peevish school-boy, worthless of such honour,"
7539,Join’d with a masker and a reveller.
7540,"Defiance, traitors, hurl we in your teeth."
7541,"If you dare fight today, come to the field;"
7542,"If not, when you have stomachs."
7543,"Why now, blow wind, swell billow, and swim bark!"
7544,"The storm is up, and all is on the hazard."
7545,"Ho, Lucilius! Hark, a word with you."
7546,What says my General?
7547,This is my birth-day; as this very day
7548,"Was Cassius born. Give me thy hand, Messala:"
7549,Be thou my witness that against my will
7550,"As Pompey was, am I compell’d to set"
7551,Upon one battle all our liberties.
7552,"You know that I held Epicurus strong,"
7553,"And his opinion. Now I change my mind,"
7554,And partly credit things that do presage.
7555,"Coming from Sardis, on our former ensign"
7556,"Two mighty eagles fell, and there they perch’d,"
7557,"Gorging and feeding from our soldiers’ hands,"
7558,Who to Philippi here consorted us.
7559,"This morning are they fled away and gone,"
7560,"And in their steads do ravens, crows, and kites"
7561,"Fly o’er our heads, and downward look on us,"
7562,As we were sickly prey: their shadows seem
7563,"A canopy most fatal, under which"
7564,"Our army lies, ready to give up the ghost."
7565,"I but believe it partly,"
7566,"For I am fresh of spirit, and resolv’d"
7567,To meet all perils very constantly.
7568,"Now, most noble Brutus,"
7569,"The gods today stand friendly, that we may,"
7570,"Lovers in peace, lead on our days to age!"
7571,"But, since the affairs of men rest still incertain,"
7572,Let’s reason with the worst that may befall.
7573,"If we do lose this battle, then is this"
7574,The very last time we shall speak together:
7575,What are you then determined to do?
7576,Even by the rule of that philosophy
7577,By which I did blame Cato for the death
7578,"Which he did give himself, I know not how,"
7579,"But I do find it cowardly and vile,"
7580,"For fear of what might fall, so to prevent"
7581,"The time of life, arming myself with patience"
7582,To stay the providence of some high powers
7583,That govern us below.
7584,"Then, if we lose this battle,"
7585,You are contented to be led in triumph
7586,Thorough the streets of Rome?
7587,"No, Cassius, no: think not, thou noble Roman,"
7588,That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome;
7589,He bears too great a mind. But this same day
7590,Must end that work the Ides of March begun;
7591,And whether we shall meet again I know not.
7592,Therefore our everlasting farewell take.
7593,"For ever, and for ever, farewell, Cassius."
7594,"If we do meet again, why, we shall smile;"
7595,"If not, why then this parting was well made."
7596,"For ever and for ever farewell, Brutus."
7597,"If we do meet again, we’ll smile indeed;"
7598,"If not, ’tis true this parting was well made."
7599,"Why then, lead on. O, that a man might know"
7600,The end of this day’s business ere it come!
7601,"But it sufficeth that the day will end,"
7602,"And then the end is known. Come, ho! away!"
7603,SCENE II. The same. The field of battle.
7604,Alarum. Enter Brutus and Messala.
7605,"Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills"
7606,Unto the legions on the other side.
7607,Let them set on at once; for I perceive
7608,"But cold demeanor in Octavius’ wing,"
7609,And sudden push gives them the overthrow.
7610,"Ride, ride, Messala; let them all come down."
7611,SCENE III. Another part of the field.
7612,Alarum. Enter Cassius and Titinius.
7613,"O, look, Titinius, look, the villains fly!"
7614,Myself have to mine own turn’d enemy:
7615,This ensign here of mine was turning back;
7616,"I slew the coward, and did take it from him."
7617,"O Cassius, Brutus gave the word too early,"
7618,"Who, having some advantage on Octavius,"
7619,"Took it too eagerly: his soldiers fell to spoil,"
7620,Whilst we by Antony are all enclos’d.
7621,"Fly further off, my lord, fly further off;"
7622,"Mark Antony is in your tents, my lord."
7623,"Fly, therefore, noble Cassius, fly far off."
7624,"This hill is far enough. Look, look, Titinius;"
7625,Are those my tents where I perceive the fire?
7626,"They are, my lord."
7627,"Titinius, if thou lovest me,"
7628,"Mount thou my horse and hide thy spurs in him,"
7629,Till he have brought thee up to yonder troops
7630,"And here again, that I may rest assur’d"
7631,Whether yond troops are friend or enemy.
7632,"I will be here again, even with a thought."
7633,"Go, Pindarus, get higher on that hill,"
7634,"My sight was ever thick. Regard Titinius,"
7635,And tell me what thou notest about the field.
7636,"This day I breathed first. Time is come round,"
7637,"And where I did begin, there shall I end."
7638,"My life is run his compass. Sirrah, what news?"
7639,"With horsemen, that make to him on the spur,"
7640,Yet he spurs on. Now they are almost on him.
7641,"Now, Titinius! Now some light. O, he lights too."
7642,"And, hark! they shout for joy."
7643,Come down; behold no more.
7644,"O, coward that I am, to live so long,"
7645,To see my best friend ta’en before my face!
7646,In Parthia did I take thee prisoner;
7647,"And then I swore thee, saving of thy life,"
7648,"That whatsoever I did bid thee do,"
7649,"Thou shouldst attempt it. Come now, keep thine oath."
7650,"Now be a freeman; and with this good sword,"
7651,"That ran through Caesar’s bowels, search this bosom."
7652,"Stand not to answer. Here, take thou the hilts;"
7653,"And when my face is cover’d, as ’tis now,"
7654,"Guide thou the sword.—Caesar, thou art reveng’d,"
7655,Even with the sword that kill’d thee.
7656,"So, I am free, yet would not so have been,"
7657,Durst I have done my will. O Cassius!
7658,"Far from this country Pindarus shall run,"
7659,Where never Roman shall take note of him.
7660,Enter Titinius with Messala.
7661,"It is but change, Titinius; for Octavius"
7662,"Is overthrown by noble Brutus’ power,"
7663,As Cassius’ legions are by Antony.
7664,These tidings would well comfort Cassius.
7665,Where did you leave him?
7666,"With Pindarus his bondman, on this hill."
7667,Is not that he that lies upon the ground?
7668,He lies not like the living. O my heart!
7669,Is not that he?
7670,"No, this was he, Messala,"
7671,"But Cassius is no more. O setting sun,"
7672,"As in thy red rays thou dost sink to night,"
7673,So in his red blood Cassius’ day is set.
7674,The sun of Rome is set. Our day is gone;
7675,"Clouds, dews, and dangers come; our deeds are done."
7676,Mistrust of my success hath done this deed.
7677,Mistrust of good success hath done this deed.
7678,"O hateful Error, Melancholy’s child!"
7679,Why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men
7680,"The things that are not? O Error, soon conceiv’d,"
7681,"Thou never com’st unto a happy birth,"
7682,But kill’st the mother that engender’d thee!
7683,"What, Pindarus! where art thou, Pindarus?"
7684,"Seek him, Titinius, whilst I go to meet"
7685,"The noble Brutus, thrusting this report"
7686,Into his ears. I may say thrusting it;
7687,For piercing steel and darts envenomed
7688,Shall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus
7689,As tidings of this sight.
7690,And I will seek for Pindarus the while.
7691,"Why didst thou send me forth, brave Cassius?"
7692,Did I not meet thy friends? And did not they
7693,"Put on my brows this wreath of victory,"
7694,And bid me give it thee? Didst thou not hear their shouts?
7695,"Alas, thou hast misconstrued everything!"
7696,"But, hold thee, take this garland on thy brow;"
7697,"Thy Brutus bid me give it thee, and I"
7698,"Will do his bidding. Brutus, come apace,"
7699,And see how I regarded Caius Cassius.
7700,"By your leave, gods. This is a Roman’s part."
7701,"Come, Cassius’ sword, and find Titinius’ heart."
7702,"Alarum. Enter Brutus, Messala, young Cato, Strato, Volumnius and"
7703,"Where, where, Messala, doth his body lie?"
7704,"Lo, yonder, and Titinius mourning it."
7705,Titinius’ face is upward.
7706,"O Julius Caesar, thou art mighty yet!"
7707,"Thy spirit walks abroad, and turns our swords"
7708,In our own proper entrails.
7709,Look whether he have not crown’d dead Cassius!
7710,Are yet two Romans living such as these?
7711,"The last of all the Romans, fare thee well!"
7712,It is impossible that ever Rome
7713,"Should breed thy fellow. Friends, I owe more tears"
7714,To this dead man than you shall see me pay.
7715,"I shall find time, Cassius, I shall find time."
7716,"Come therefore, and to Thassos send his body."
7717,"His funerals shall not be in our camp,"
7718,"Lest it discomfort us. Lucilius, come;"
7719,"And come, young Cato; let us to the field."
7720,"Labeo and Flavius, set our battles on."
7721,"’Tis three o’clock; and Romans, yet ere night"
7722,We shall try fortune in a second fight.
7723,SCENE IV. Another part of the field.
7724,"Alarum. Enter fighting soldiers of both armies; then Brutus, Messala,"
7725,"young Cato, Lucilius, Flavius and others."
7726,"Yet, countrymen, O, yet hold up your heads!"
7727,What bastard doth not? Who will go with me?
7728,I will proclaim my name about the field.
7729,"I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!"
7730,"A foe to tyrants, and my country’s friend."
7731,"I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!"
7732,"And I am Brutus, Marcus Brutus, I;"
7733,"Brutus, my country’s friend; know me for Brutus!"
7734,"O young and noble Cato, art thou down?"
7735,"Why, now thou diest as bravely as Titinius,"
7736,"And mayst be honour’d, being Cato’s son."
7737,"Yield, or thou diest."
7738,Only I yield to die:
7739,There is so much that thou wilt kill me straight;
7740,"Kill Brutus, and be honour’d in his death."
7741,We must not. A noble prisoner!
7742,"Room, ho! Tell Antony, Brutus is ta’en."
7743,I’ll tell the news. Here comes the General.
7744,"Brutus is ta’en, Brutus is ta’en, my lord."
7745,"Safe, Antony; Brutus is safe enough."
7746,I dare assure thee that no enemy
7747,Shall ever take alive the noble Brutus.
7748,The gods defend him from so great a shame!
7749,"When you do find him, or alive or dead,"
7750,"He will be found like Brutus, like himself."
7751,"This is not Brutus, friend; but, I assure you,"
7752,"A prize no less in worth. Keep this man safe,"
7753,Give him all kindness. I had rather have
7754,"Such men my friends than enemies. Go on,"
7755,And see whether Brutus be alive or dead;
7756,And bring us word unto Octavius’ tent
7757,How everything is chanc’d.
7758,SCENE V. Another part of the field.
7759,"Enter Brutus, Dardanius, Clitus, Strato and Volumnius."
7760,"Come, poor remains of friends, rest on this rock."
7761,"Statilius show’d the torch-light; but, my lord,"
7762,He came not back: he is or ta’en or slain.
7763,"Sit thee down, Clitus. Slaying is the word;"
7764,"It is a deed in fashion. Hark thee, Clitus."
7765,"What, I, my lord? No, not for all the world."
7766,"Peace then, no words."
7767,I’ll rather kill myself.
7768,Shall I do such a deed?
7769,What ill request did Brutus make to thee?
7770,"To kill him, Clitus. Look, he meditates."
7771,"Now is that noble vessel full of grief,"
7772,That it runs over even at his eyes.
7773,"Come hither, good Volumnius; list a word."
7774,What says my lord?
7775,The ghost of Caesar hath appear’d to me
7776,"Two several times by night; at Sardis once,"
7777,And this last night here in Philippi fields.
7778,I know my hour is come.
7779,"Not so, my lord."
7780,"Nay I am sure it is, Volumnius."
7781,"Thou seest the world, Volumnius, how it goes;"
7782,Our enemies have beat us to the pit.
7783,It is more worthy to leap in ourselves
7784,"Than tarry till they push us. Good Volumnius,"
7785,Thou know’st that we two went to school together;
7786,"Even for that our love of old, I pr’ythee"
7787,"Hold thou my sword-hilts, whilst I run on it."
7788,"That’s not an office for a friend, my lord."
7789,"Fly, fly, my lord! there is no tarrying here."
7790,"Farewell to you; and you; and you, Volumnius."
7791,"Strato, thou hast been all this while asleep;"
7792,"Farewell to thee too, Strato.—Countrymen,"
7793,"My heart doth joy, that yet in all my life"
7794,I found no man but he was true to me.
7795,I shall have glory by this losing day
7796,More than Octavius and Mark Antony
7797,By this vile conquest shall attain unto.
7798,So fare you well at once; for Brutus’ tongue
7799,Hath almost ended his life’s history.
7800,"Night hangs upon mine eyes; my bones would rest,"
7801,That have but labour’d to attain this hour.
7802,"Fly, my lord, fly!"
7803,Hence! I will follow.
7804,"I pr’ythee, Strato, stay thou by thy lord."
7805,Thou art a fellow of a good respect;
7806,Thy life hath had some smatch of honour in it.
7807,"Hold then my sword, and turn away thy face,"
7808,"While I do run upon it. Wilt thou, Strato?"
7809,"Give me your hand first. Fare you well, my lord."
7810,"Farewell, good Strato.—Caesar, now be still:"
7811,I kill’d not thee with half so good a will.
7812,"Alarum. Retreat. Enter Antony, Octavius, Messala, Lucilius and the"
7813,What man is that?
7814,"My master’s man. Strato, where is thy master?"
7815,"Free from the bondage you are in, Messala."
7816,The conquerors can but make a fire of him;
7817,"For Brutus only overcame himself,"
7818,And no man else hath honour by his death.
7819,"So Brutus should be found. I thank thee, Brutus,"
7820,That thou hast prov’d Lucilius’ saying true.
7821,"All that serv’d Brutus, I will entertain them."
7822,"Fellow, wilt thou bestow thy time with me?"
7823,"Ay, if Messala will prefer me to you."
7824,"Do so, good Messala."
7825,"How died my master, Strato?"
7826,"I held the sword, and he did run on it."
7827,"Octavius, then take him to follow thee,"
7828,That did the latest service to my master.
7829,This was the noblest Roman of them all.
7830,"All the conspirators save only he,"
7831,Did that they did in envy of great Caesar;
7832,"He only, in a general honest thought"
7833,"And common good to all, made one of them."
7834,"His life was gentle, and the elements"
7835,So mix’d in him that Nature might stand up
7836,"And say to all the world, “This was a man!”"
7837,According to his virtue let us use him
7838,With all respect and rites of burial.
7839,"Within my tent his bones tonight shall lie,"
7840,"Most like a soldier, order’d honourably."
7841,"So call the field to rest, and let’s away,"
7842,To part the glories of this happy day.

7882,SCENE I. A Room of State in King Lear’s Palace
7883,"Enter Kent, Gloucester and Edmund."
7884,I thought the King had more affected the Duke of Albany than Cornwall.
7885,"It did always seem so to us; but now, in the division of the kingdom,"
7886,"it appears not which of the Dukes he values most, for qualities are so"
7887,weighed that curiosity in neither can make choice of either’s moiety.
7888,"Is not this your son, my lord?"
7889,"His breeding, sir, hath been at my charge: I have so often"
7890,blush’d to acknowledge him that now I am braz’d to’t.
7891,I cannot conceive you.
7892,"Sir, this young fellow’s mother could; whereupon she grew"
7893,"round-wombed, and had indeed, sir, a son for her cradle ere she"
7894,had a husband for her bed. Do you smell a fault?
7895,"I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it being so proper."
7896,"But I have a son, sir, by order of law, some year elder than"
7897,"this, who yet is no dearer in my account: though this knave came"
7898,"something saucily to the world before he was sent for, yet was"
7899,"his mother fair; there was good sport at his making, and the"
7900,"whoreson must be acknowledged. Do you know this noble gentleman,"
7901,My Lord of Kent: remember him hereafter as my honourable friend.
7902,My services to your lordship.
7903,"I must love you, and sue to know you better."
7904,"Sir, I shall study deserving."
7905,"He hath been out nine years, and away he shall again. The King"
7906,"Enter Lear, Cornwall, Albany, Goneril, Regan, Cordelia and Attendants."
7907,"Attend the lords of France and Burgundy,"
7908,"I shall, my lord."
7909,Meantime we shall express our darker purpose.
7910,Give me the map there. Know that we have divided
7911,In three our kingdom: and ’tis our fast intent
7912,To shake all cares and business from our age;
7913,"Conferring them on younger strengths, while we"
7914,"Unburden’d crawl toward death. Our son of Cornwall,"
7915,"And you, our no less loving son of Albany,"
7916,We have this hour a constant will to publish
7917,"Our daughters’ several dowers, that future strife"
7918,"May be prevented now. The princes, France and Burgundy,"
7919,"Great rivals in our youngest daughter’s love,"
7920,"Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn,"
7921,"And here are to be answer’d. Tell me, my daughters,—"
7922,"Since now we will divest us both of rule,"
7923,"Interest of territory, cares of state,—"
7924,Which of you shall we say doth love us most?
7925,That we our largest bounty may extend
7926,"Where nature doth with merit challenge.—Goneril,"
7927,"Our eldest born, speak first."
7928,"Sir, I love you more than word can wield the matter;"
7929,"Dearer than eyesight, space, and liberty;"
7930,"Beyond what can be valu’d, rich or rare;"
7931,"No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour;"
7932,"As much as child e’er lov’d, or father found;"
7933,A love that makes breath poor and speech unable;
7934,Beyond all manner of so much I love you.
7935,"Of all these bounds, even from this line to this,"
7936,"With shadowy forests and with champains rich’d,"
7937,"With plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads,"
7938,We make thee lady: to thine and Albany’s issue
7939,"Be this perpetual.—What says our second daughter,"
7940,"Our dearest Regan, wife of Cornwall? Speak."
7941,"Sir, I am made of the self mettle as my sister,"
7942,And prize me at her worth. In my true heart
7943,I find she names my very deed of love;
7944,"Only she comes too short, that I profess"
7945,Myself an enemy to all other joys
7946,"Which the most precious square of sense possesses,"
7947,And find I am alone felicitate
7948,In your dear highness’ love.
7949,"And yet not so; since, I am sure, my love’s"
7950,More ponderous than my tongue.
7951,To thee and thine hereditary ever
7952,Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom;
7953,"No less in space, validity, and pleasure"
7954,"Than that conferr’d on Goneril.—Now, our joy,"
7955,Although the last and least; to whose young love
7956,The vines of France and milk of Burgundy
7957,Strive to be interess’d; what can you say to draw
7958,A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.
7959,Nothing will come of nothing: speak again.
7960,"Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave"
7961,My heart into my mouth: I love your majesty
7962,According to my bond; no more nor less.
7963,"How, how, Cordelia? Mend your speech a little,"
7964,Lest you may mar your fortunes.
7965,"You have begot me, bred me, lov’d me: I"
7966,"Return those duties back as are right fit,"
7967,"Obey you, love you, and most honour you."
7968,Why have my sisters husbands if they say
7969,"They love you all? Haply, when I shall wed,"
7970,That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry
7971,"Half my love with him, half my care and duty:"
7972,"Sure I shall never marry like my sisters,"
7973,To love my father all.
7974,But goes thy heart with this?
7975,"Ay, my good lord."
7976,"So young, and so untender?"
7977,"So young, my lord, and true."
7978,"Let it be so, thy truth then be thy dower:"
7979,"For, by the sacred radiance of the sun,"
7980,The mysteries of Hecate and the night;
7981,"By all the operation of the orbs,"
7982,From whom we do exist and cease to be;
7983,"Here I disclaim all my paternal care,"
7984,"Propinquity and property of blood,"
7985,And as a stranger to my heart and me
7986,"Hold thee from this for ever. The barbarous Scythian,"
7987,Or he that makes his generation messes
7988,"To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom"
7989,"Be as well neighbour’d, pitied, and reliev’d,"
7990,As thou my sometime daughter.
7991,Come not between the dragon and his wrath.
7992,"I lov’d her most, and thought to set my rest"
7993,On her kind nursery. [_To Cordelia._] Hence and avoid my sight!
7994,"So be my grave my peace, as here I give"
7995,Her father’s heart from her! Call France. Who stirs?
7996,"Call Burgundy! Cornwall and Albany,"
7997,With my two daughters’ dowers digest this third:
7998,"Let pride, which she calls plainness, marry her."
7999,"I do invest you jointly with my power,"
8000,"Pre-eminence, and all the large effects"
8001,"That troop with majesty. Ourself, by monthly course,"
8002,"With reservation of an hundred knights,"
8003,"By you to be sustain’d, shall our abode"
8004,Make with you by due turn. Only we shall retain
8005,"The name, and all the addition to a king; the sway,"
8006,"Revenue, execution of the rest,"
8007,"Beloved sons, be yours; which to confirm,"
8008,This coronet part between you.
8009,"Whom I have ever honour’d as my king,"
8010,"Lov’d as my father, as my master follow’d,"
8011,As my great patron thought on in my prayers.—
8012,The bow is bent and drawn; make from the shaft.
8013,"Let it fall rather, though the fork invade"
8014,The region of my heart: be Kent unmannerly
8015,"When Lear is mad. What wouldst thou do, old man?"
8016,"Think’st thou that duty shall have dread to speak,"
8017,When power to flattery bows? To plainness honour’s bound
8018,When majesty falls to folly. Reverse thy state;
8019,And in thy best consideration check
8020,"This hideous rashness: answer my life my judgement,"
8021,Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least;
8022,"Nor are those empty-hearted, whose low sounds"
8023,"Kent, on thy life, no more."
8024,My life I never held but as a pawn
8025,"To wage against thine enemies; ne’er fear to lose it,"
8026,Thy safety being the motive.
8027,Out of my sight!
8028,"See better, Lear; and let me still remain"
8029,The true blank of thine eye.
8030,"Now by Apollo, King,"
8031,Thou swear’st thy gods in vain.
8032,"Kill thy physician, and the fee bestow"
8033,"Upon the foul disease. Revoke thy gift,"
8034,"Or, whilst I can vent clamour from my throat,"
8035,I’ll tell thee thou dost evil.
8036,"Hear me, recreant! on thine allegiance, hear me!"
8037,"Since thou hast sought to make us break our vows,"
8038,"Which we durst never yet, and with strain’d pride"
8039,"To come betwixt our sentences and our power,"
8040,"Which nor our nature, nor our place can bear,"
8041,"Our potency made good, take thy reward."
8042,"Five days we do allot thee for provision,"
8043,To shield thee from disasters of the world;
8044,And on the sixth to turn thy hated back
8045,"Upon our kingdom: if, on the next day following,"
8046,"Thy banish’d trunk be found in our dominions,"
8047,"The moment is thy death. Away! By Jupiter,"
8048,This shall not be revok’d.
8049,"Fare thee well, King: sith thus thou wilt appear,"
8050,"Freedom lives hence, and banishment is here."
8051,That justly think’st and hast most rightly said!
8052,That good effects may spring from words of love.
8053,"Thus Kent, O princes, bids you all adieu;"
8054,He’ll shape his old course in a country new.
8055,"Flourish. Re-enter Gloucester, with France, Burgundy and Attendants."
8056,"Here’s France and Burgundy, my noble lord."
8057,"My Lord of Burgundy,"
8058,"We first address toward you, who with this king"
8059,Hath rivall’d for our daughter: what in the least
8060,"Will you require in present dower with her,"
8061,Or cease your quest of love?
8062,"I crave no more than hath your highness offer’d,"
8063,Nor will you tender less.
8064,"When she was dear to us, we did hold her so;"
8065,"But now her price is fall’n. Sir, there she stands:"
8066,"If aught within that little-seeming substance,"
8067,"Or all of it, with our displeasure piec’d,"
8068,"And nothing more, may fitly like your grace,"
8069,"She’s there, and she is yours."
8070,I know no answer.
8071,"Will you, with those infirmities she owes,"
8072,"Unfriended, new adopted to our hate,"
8073,"Dower’d with our curse, and stranger’d with our oath,"
8074,Take her or leave her?
8075,"Pardon me, royal sir;"
8076,Election makes not up in such conditions.
8077,"Then leave her, sir; for, by the power that made me,"
8078,"I tell you all her wealth. [_To France_] For you, great king,"
8079,I would not from your love make such a stray
8080,To match you where I hate; therefore beseech you
8081,T’avert your liking a more worthier way
8082,Than on a wretch whom nature is asham’d
8083,"This is most strange,"
8084,"That she, who even but now was your best object,"
8085,"The argument of your praise, balm of your age,"
8086,"The best, the dearest, should in this trice of time"
8087,"Commit a thing so monstrous, to dismantle"
8088,So many folds of favour. Sure her offence
8089,Must be of such unnatural degree
8090,"That monsters it, or your fore-vouch’d affection"
8091,Fall into taint; which to believe of her
8092,Must be a faith that reason without miracle
8093,Should never plant in me.
8094,"I yet beseech your majesty,"
8095,If for I want that glib and oily art
8096,"To speak and purpose not; since what I well intend,"
8097,"I’ll do’t before I speak,—that you make known"
8098,"It is no vicious blot, murder, or foulness,"
8099,"No unchaste action or dishonour’d step,"
8100,That hath depriv’d me of your grace and favour;
8101,"But even for want of that for which I am richer,"
8102,"A still soliciting eye, and such a tongue"
8103,"As I am glad I have not, though not to have it"
8104,Hath lost me in your liking.
8105,Not been born than not to have pleas’d me better.
8106,Is it but this?—a tardiness in nature
8107,Which often leaves the history unspoke
8108,"That it intends to do? My lord of Burgundy,"
8109,What say you to the lady? Love’s not love
8110,When it is mingled with regards that stands
8111,Aloof from the entire point. Will you have her?
8112,She is herself a dowry.
8113,"Give but that portion which yourself propos’d,"
8114,"And here I take Cordelia by the hand,"
8115,Nothing: I have sworn; I am firm.
8116,"I am sorry, then, you have so lost a father"
8117,That you must lose a husband.
8118,Peace be with Burgundy!
8119,"Since that respects of fortunes are his love,"
8120,I shall not be his wife.
8121,"Fairest Cordelia, that art most rich, being poor;"
8122,"Most choice forsaken; and most lov’d, despis’d!"
8123,Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon:
8124,"Be it lawful, I take up what’s cast away."
8125,"Gods, gods! ’Tis strange that from their cold’st neglect"
8126,My love should kindle to inflam’d respect.
8127,"Thy dowerless daughter, King, thrown to my chance,"
8128,"Is queen of us, of ours, and our fair France:"
8129,Not all the dukes of waterish Burgundy
8130,Can buy this unpriz’d precious maid of me.
8131,"Bid them farewell, Cordelia, though unkind:"
8132,"Thou losest here, a better where to find."
8133,"Thou hast her, France: let her be thine; for we"
8134,"Have no such daughter, nor shall ever see"
8135,That face of hers again. Therefore be gone
8136,"Without our grace, our love, our benison."
8137,"[_Flourish. Exeunt Lear, Burgundy, Cornwall, Albany, Gloucester and"
8138,Bid farewell to your sisters.
8139,"The jewels of our father, with wash’d eyes"
8140,Cordelia leaves you: I know you what you are;
8141,And like a sister am most loath to call
8142,Your faults as they are nam’d. Love well our father:
8143,To your professed bosoms I commit him:
8144,"But yet, alas, stood I within his grace,"
8145,I would prefer him to a better place.
8146,So farewell to you both.
8147,Prescribe not us our duties.
8148,"Be to content your lord, who hath receiv’d you"
8149,"At fortune’s alms. You have obedience scanted,"
8150,And well are worth the want that you have wanted.
8151,Time shall unfold what plighted cunning hides:
8152,"Who covers faults, at last shame derides."
8153,Well may you prosper.
8154,"Come, my fair Cordelia."
8155,"Sister, it is not little I have to say of what most nearly"
8156,appertains to us both. I think our father will hence tonight.
8157,"That’s most certain, and with you; next month with us."
8158,You see how full of changes his age is; the observation we
8159,have made of it hath not been little: he always loved our
8160,sister most; and with what poor judgement he hath now cast her
8161,off appears too grossly.
8162,’Tis the infirmity of his age: yet he hath ever but slenderly
8163,The best and soundest of his time hath been but rash; then must
8164,we look from his age to receive not alone the imperfections of
8165,"long-engrafted condition, but therewithal the unruly waywardness"
8166,that infirm and choleric years bring with them.
8167,Such unconstant starts are we like to have from him as this of Kent’s
8168,There is further compliment of leave-taking between France and
8169,him. Pray you let us hit together: if our father carry authority
8170,"with such disposition as he bears, this last surrender of his"
8171,will but offend us.
8172,We shall further think of it.
8173,"We must do something, and i’ th’ heat."
8174,SCENE II. A Hall in the Earl of Gloucester’s Castle
8175,Enter Edmund with a
8176,"Thou, Nature, art my goddess; to thy law"
8177,My services are bound. Wherefore should I
8178,"Stand in the plague of custom, and permit"
8179,The curiosity of nations to deprive me?
8180,For that I am some twelve or fourteen moonshines
8181,Lag of a brother? Why bastard? Wherefore base?
8182,"When my dimensions are as well compact,"
8183,"My mind as generous, and my shape as true"
8184,As honest madam’s issue? Why brand they us
8185,"With base? With baseness? bastardy? Base, base?"
8186,"Who, in the lusty stealth of nature, take"
8187,More composition and fierce quality
8188,Than doth within a dull stale tired bed
8189,Go to the creating a whole tribe of fops
8190,"Got ’tween asleep and wake? Well then,"
8191,"Legitimate Edgar, I must have your land:"
8192,Our father’s love is to the bastard Edmund
8193,As to the legitimate: fine word: legitimate!
8194,"Well, my legitimate, if this letter speed,"
8195,"And my invention thrive, Edmund the base"
8196,"Shall top the legitimate. I grow, I prosper."
8197,"Now, gods, stand up for bastards!"
8198,Kent banish’d thus! and France in choler parted!
8199,And the King gone tonight! Prescrib’d his pow’r!
8200,Confin’d to exhibition! All this done
8201,"Upon the gad!—Edmund, how now! What news?"
8202,"So please your lordship, none."
8203,Why so earnestly seek you to put up that letter?
8204,"I know no news, my lord."
8205,What paper were you reading?
8206,No? What needed then that terrible dispatch of it into your pocket? The
8207,"quality of nothing hath not such need to hide itself. Let’s see. Come,"
8208,"if it be nothing, I shall not need spectacles."
8209,"I beseech you, sir, pardon me. It is a letter from my brother that I"
8210,"have not all o’er-read; and for so much as I have perus’d, I find it"
8211,not fit for your o’er-looking.
8212,"Give me the letter, sir."
8213,"I shall offend, either to detain or give it. The contents, as in"
8214,"part I understand them, are to blame."
8215,"Let’s see, let’s see!"
8216,"I hope, for my brother’s justification, he wrote this but as an"
8217,"essay, or taste of my virtue."
8218,bitter to the best of our times; keeps our fortunes from us
8219,till our oldness cannot relish them. I begin to find an idle
8220,and fond bondage in the oppression of aged tyranny; who sways
8221,"not as it hath power, but as it is suffered. Come to me, that"
8222,of this I may speak more. If our father would sleep till I
8223,"waked him, you should enjoy half his revenue for ever, and live"
8224,the beloved of your brother EDGAR.’
8225,"Hum! Conspiracy? ‘Sleep till I wake him, you should enjoy half"
8226,his revenue.’—My son Edgar! Had he a hand to write this? A heart
8227,and brain to breed it in? When came this to you? Who brought it?
8228,"It was not brought me, my lord, there’s the cunning of it. I"
8229,found it thrown in at the casement of my closet.
8230,You know the character to be your brother’s?
8231,"If the matter were good, my lord, I durst swear it were his; but"
8232,"in respect of that, I would fain think it were not."
8233,"It is his hand, my lord; but I hope his heart is not in the"
8234,Has he never before sounded you in this business?
8235,"Never, my lord. But I have heard him oft maintain it to be fit"
8236,"that, sons at perfect age, and fathers declined, the father"
8237,"should be as ward to the son, and the son manage his revenue."
8238,"O villain, villain! His very opinion in the letter! Abhorred"
8239,"villain! Unnatural, detested, brutish villain! worse than"
8240,"brutish! Go, sirrah, seek him; I’ll apprehend him. Abominable"
8241,"villain, Where is he?"
8242,"I do not well know, my lord. If it shall please you to suspend"
8243,your indignation against my brother till you can derive from him
8244,"better testimony of his intent, you should run a certain course;"
8245,"where, if you violently proceed against him, mistaking his"
8246,"purpose, it would make a great gap in your own honour, and shake"
8247,in pieces the heart of his obedience. I dare pawn down my life
8248,"for him, that he hath writ this to feel my affection to your"
8249,"honour, and to no other pretence of danger."
8250,"If your honour judge it meet, I will place you where you shall hear us"
8251,"confer of this, and by an auricular assurance have your satisfaction,"
8252,and that without any further delay than this very evening.
8253,He cannot be such a monster.
8254,"Nor is not, sure."
8255,"To his father, that so tenderly and entirely loves him. Heaven"
8256,"and earth! Edmund, seek him out; wind me into him, I pray you:"
8257,frame the business after your own wisdom. I would unstate myself
8258,to be in a due resolution.
8259,"I will seek him, sir, presently; convey the business as I shall"
8260,"find means, and acquaint you withal."
8261,These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good to us:
8262,"though the wisdom of Nature can reason it thus and thus, yet"
8263,"nature finds itself scourged by the sequent effects. Love cools,"
8264,"friendship falls off, brothers divide: in cities, mutinies; in"
8265,"countries, discord; in palaces, treason; and the bond cracked"
8266,’twixt son and father. This villain of mine comes under the
8267,prediction; there’s son against father: the King falls from
8268,bias of nature; there’s father against child. We have seen the
8269,"best of our time. Machinations, hollowness, treachery, and all"
8270,ruinous disorders follow us disquietly to our graves. Find out
8271,"this villain, Edmund; it shall lose thee nothing; do it"
8272,carefully.—And the noble and true-hearted Kent banished! his
8273,"offence, honesty! ’Tis strange."
8274,"This is the excellent foppery of the world, that, when we are"
8275,"sick in fortune, often the surfeits of our own behaviour, we"
8276,"make guilty of our disasters the sun, the moon, and the stars; as"
8277,if we were villains on necessity; fools by heavenly compulsion;
8278,"knaves, thieves, and treachers by spherical predominance;"
8279,"drunkards, liars, and adulterers by an enforced obedience of"
8280,"planetary influence; and all that we are evil in, by a divine"
8281,"thrusting on. An admirable evasion of whoremaster man, to lay his"
8282,goatish disposition to the charge of a star. My father compounded
8283,"with my mother under the dragon’s tail, and my nativity was under"
8284,"Ursa Major, so that it follows I am rough and lecherous. Fut! I"
8285,"should have been that I am, had the maidenliest star in the"
8286,firmament twinkled on my bastardizing.
8287,"Pat! he comes, like the catastrophe of the old comedy: my cue"
8288,"is villainous melancholy, with a sigh like Tom o’Bedlam.—O,"
8289,"these eclipses do portend these divisions! Fa, sol, la, mi."
8290,"How now, brother Edmund, what serious contemplation are you in?"
8291,"I am thinking, brother, of a prediction I read this other day,"
8292,what should follow these eclipses.
8293,Do you busy yourself with that?
8294,"I promise you, the effects he writes of succeed unhappily: as of"
8295,"unnaturalness between the child and the parent; death, dearth,"
8296,"dissolutions of ancient amities; divisions in state, menaces and"
8297,"maledictions against King and nobles; needless diffidences,"
8298,"banishment of friends, dissipation of cohorts, nuptial breaches,"
8299,and I know not what.
8300,How long have you been a sectary astronomical?
8301,"Come, come! when saw you my father last?"
8302,The night gone by.
8303,Spake you with him?
8304,"Ay, two hours together."
8305,"Parted you in good terms? Found you no displeasure in him, by word"
8306,Bethink yourself wherein you may have offended him: and at my
8307,entreaty forbear his presence until some little time hath
8308,qualified the heat of his displeasure; which at this instant so
8309,rageth in him that with the mischief of your person it would
8310,Some villain hath done me wrong.
8311,That’s my fear. I pray you have a continent forbearance till the
8312,"speed of his rage goes slower; and, as I say, retire with me to"
8313,"my lodging, from whence I will fitly bring you to hear my lord"
8314,"speak: pray ye, go; there’s my key. If you do stir abroad, go"
8315,"Brother, I advise you to the best; I am no honest man"
8316,if there be any good meaning toward you: I have told you what I
8317,have seen and heard. But faintly; nothing like the image and
8318,"horror of it: pray you, away!"
8319,Shall I hear from you anon?
8320,I do serve you in this business.
8321,"A credulous father! and a brother noble,"
8322,Whose nature is so far from doing harms
8323,That he suspects none; on whose foolish honesty
8324,My practices ride easy! I see the business.
8325,"Let me, if not by birth, have lands by wit;"
8326,All with me’s meet that I can fashion fit.
8327,SCENE III. A Room in the Duke of Albany’s Palace
8328,Enter Goneril and Oswald.
8329,Did my father strike my gentleman for chiding of his fool?
8330,"By day and night, he wrongs me; every hour"
8331,"He flashes into one gross crime or other,"
8332,That sets us all at odds; I’ll not endure it:
8333,"His knights grow riotous, and himself upbraids us"
8334,"On every trifle. When he returns from hunting,"
8335,I will not speak with him; say I am sick.
8336,"If you come slack of former services,"
8337,You shall do well; the fault of it I’ll answer.
8338,"He’s coming, madam; I hear him."
8339,"Put on what weary negligence you please,"
8340,You and your fellows; I’d have it come to question:
8341,"If he distaste it, let him to our sister,"
8342,"Whose mind and mine, I know, in that are one,"
8343,"Not to be overruled. Idle old man,"
8344,That still would manage those authorities
8345,"That he hath given away! Now, by my life,"
8346,Old fools are babes again; and must be us’d
8347,"With checks as flatteries, when they are seen abus’d."
8348,Remember what I have said.
8349,And let his knights have colder looks among you;
8350,"What grows of it, no matter; advise your fellows so;"
8351,"I would breed from hence occasions, and I shall,"
8352,That I may speak. I’ll write straight to my sister
8353,To hold my very course. Prepare for dinner.
8354,SCENE IV. A Hall in Albany’s Palace
8355,"If but as well I other accents borrow,"
8356,"That can my speech defuse, my good intent"
8357,May carry through itself to that full issue
8358,"For which I rais’d my likeness. Now, banish’d Kent,"
8359,"If thou canst serve where thou dost stand condemn’d,"
8360,"So may it come, thy master, whom thou lov’st,"
8361,Shall find thee full of labours.
8362,Horns within. Enter King
8363,"Lear, Knights and Attendants."
8364,Let me not stay a jot for dinner; go get it ready.
8365,How now! what art thou?
8366,What dost thou profess? What wouldst thou with us?
8367,I do profess to be no less than I seem; to serve him truly that
8368,will put me in trust; to love him that is honest; to converse
8369,with him that is wise and says little; to fear judgement; to fight
8370,when I cannot choose; and to eat no fish.
8371,"A very honest-hearted fellow, and as poor as the King."
8372,"If thou be’st as poor for a subject as he’s for a king, thou art"
8373,poor enough. What wouldst thou?
8374,Who wouldst thou serve?
8375,"Dost thou know me, fellow?"
8376,"No, sir; but you have that in your countenance which I would fain"
8377,What services canst thou do?
8378,"I can keep honest counsel, ride, run, mar a curious tale in"
8379,telling it and deliver a plain message bluntly. That which
8380,"ordinary men are fit for, I am qualified in, and the best of"
8381,How old art thou?
8382,"Not so young, sir, to love a woman for singing; nor so old to"
8383,dote on her for anything: I have years on my back forty-eight.
8384,"Follow me; thou shalt serve me. If I like thee no worse after dinner, I"
8385,"will not part from thee yet. Dinner, ho, dinner! Where’s my knave? my"
8386,fool? Go you and call my fool hither.
8387,"You, you, sirrah, where’s my daughter?"
8388,What says the fellow there? Call the clotpoll back.
8389,"Where’s my fool? Ho, I think the world’s asleep."
8390,How now! where’s that mongrel?
8391,"He says, my lord, your daughter is not well."
8392,Why came not the slave back to me when I called him?
8393,"Sir, he answered me in the roundest manner, he would not."
8394,"My lord, I know not what the matter is; but to my judgement your"
8395,highness is not entertained with that ceremonious affection as
8396,you were wont; there’s a great abatement of kindness appears as
8397,"well in the general dependants as in the Duke himself also, and"
8398,Ha! say’st thou so?
8399,"I beseech you pardon me, my lord, if I be mistaken; for my duty"
8400,cannot be silent when I think your highness wronged.
8401,Thou but rememberest me of mine own conception: I have perceived
8402,a most faint neglect of late; which I have rather blamed as mine
8403,own jealous curiosity than as a very pretence and purpose of
8404,unkindness: I will look further into’t. But where’s my fool? I
8405,have not seen him this two days.
8406,"Since my young lady’s going into France, sir, the fool hath much"
8407,No more of that; I have noted it well. Go you and tell my
8408,daughter I would speak with her.
8409,"Go you, call hither my fool."
8410,"O, you, sir, you, come you hither, sir: who am I, sir?"
8411,My lady’s father! my lord’s knave: you whoreson dog! you slave! you
8412,"I am none of these, my lord; I beseech your pardon."
8413,"Do you bandy looks with me, you rascal?"
8414,"I’ll not be struck, my lord."
8415,"Nor tripp’d neither, you base football player."
8416,"I thank thee, fellow. Thou serv’st me, and I’ll love thee."
8417,"Come, sir, arise, away! I’ll teach you differences: away, away! If you"
8418,"will measure your lubber’s length again, tarry; but away! go to; have"
8419,"Now, my friendly knave, I thank thee: there’s earnest of thy service."
8420,Let me hire him too; here’s my coxcomb.
8421,"How now, my pretty knave, how dost thou?"
8422,"Sirrah, you were best take my coxcomb."
8423,"Why, for taking one’s part that’s out of favour. Nay, an thou"
8424,"canst not smile as the wind sits, thou’lt catch cold shortly:"
8425,"there, take my coxcomb: why, this fellow has banish’d two on’s"
8426,"daughters, and did the third a blessing against his will; if"
8427,"thou follow him, thou must needs wear my coxcomb. How now,"
8428,nuncle! Would I had two coxcombs and two daughters!
8429,"If I gave them all my living, I’d keep my coxcombs myself. There’s"
8430,mine; beg another of thy daughters.
8431,"Take heed, sirrah, the whip."
8432,"Truth’s a dog must to kennel; he must be whipped out, when"
8433,the Lady Brach may stand by the fire and stink.
8434,A pestilent gall to me!
8435,"Sirrah, I’ll teach thee a speech."
8436,"Have more than thou showest,"
8437,"Speak less than thou knowest,"
8438,"Lend less than thou owest,"
8439,"Ride more than thou goest,"
8440,"Learn more than thou trowest,"
8441,Set less than thou throwest;
8442,"Leave thy drink and thy whore,"
8443,And thou shalt have more
8444,Than two tens to a score.
8445,"This is nothing, fool."
8446,"Then ’tis like the breath of an unfee’d lawyer, you gave me"
8447,"nothing for’t. Can you make no use of nothing, nuncle?"
8448,"Why, no, boy; nothing can be made out of nothing."
8449,comes to: he will not believe a fool.
8450,"Dost thou know the difference, my boy, between a bitter fool and"
8451,"No, lad; teach me."
8452,That lord that counsell’d thee
8453,"To give away thy land,"
8454,"Come place him here by me,"
8455,Do thou for him stand.
8456,The sweet and bitter fool
8457,"The one in motley here,"
8458,The other found out there.
8459,"Dost thou call me fool, boy?"
8460,All thy other titles thou hast given away; that thou wast born
8461,"This is not altogether fool, my lord."
8462,"No, faith; lords and great men will not let me; if I had a"
8463,"monopoly out, they would have part on’t and ladies too, they"
8464,will not let me have all the fool to myself; they’ll be
8465,"snatching. Nuncle, give me an egg, and I’ll give thee two"
8466,What two crowns shall they be?
8467,"Why, after I have cut the egg i’ the middle and eat up the"
8468,"meat, the two crowns of the egg. When thou clovest thy crown i’"
8469,"the middle and gav’st away both parts, thou bor’st thine ass on"
8470,thy back o’er the dirt: thou hadst little wit in thy bald crown
8471,when thou gav’st thy golden one away. If I speak like myself in
8472,"this, let him be whipped that first finds it so."
8473,Fools had ne’er less grace in a year;
8474,"For wise men are grown foppish,"
8475,"And know not how their wits to wear,"
8476,Their manners are so apish.
8477,"When were you wont to be so full of songs, sirrah?"
8478,"I have used it, nuncle, e’er since thou mad’st thy daughters thy"
8479,"mothers; for when thou gav’st them the rod, and put’st down thine"
8480,"Then they for sudden joy did weep,"
8481,"And I for sorrow sung,"
8482,"That such a king should play bo-peep,"
8483,And go the fools among.
8484,"Prithee, nuncle, keep a schoolmaster that can teach thy fool to"
8485,lie; I would fain learn to lie.
8486,"An you lie, sirrah, we’ll have you whipped."
8487,I marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are: they’ll have me
8488,whipped for speaking true; thou’lt have me whipped for lying;
8489,and sometimes I am whipped for holding my peace. I had rather be
8490,"any kind o’thing than a fool: and yet I would not be thee,"
8491,"nuncle: thou hast pared thy wit o’both sides, and left nothing"
8492,i’ the middle: here comes one o’ the parings.
8493,"How now, daughter? What makes that frontlet on? Methinks you"
8494,are too much of late i’ the frown.
8495,Thou wast a pretty fellow when thou hadst no need to care for
8496,her frowning. Now thou art an O without a figure: I am better
8497,"than thou art now. I am a fool, thou art nothing. [_To Goneril._]"
8498,"Yes, forsooth, I will hold my tongue. So your face bids me, though"
8499,"you say nothing. Mum, mum,"
8500,"He that keeps nor crust nor crum,"
8501,"Weary of all, shall want some."
8502,"Not only, sir, this your all-licens’d fool,"
8503,But other of your insolent retinue
8504,Do hourly carp and quarrel; breaking forth
8505,"In rank and not-to-be-endured riots. Sir,"
8506,"I had thought, by making this well known unto you,"
8507,"To have found a safe redress; but now grow fearful,"
8508,"By what yourself too late have spoke and done,"
8509,"That you protect this course, and put it on"
8510,"By your allowance; which if you should, the fault"
8511,"Would not scape censure, nor the redresses sleep,"
8512,"Which, in the tender of a wholesome weal,"
8513,Might in their working do you that offence
8514,"Which else were shame, that then necessity"
8515,Will call discreet proceeding.
8516,"For you know, nuncle,"
8517,The hedge-sparrow fed the cuckoo so long
8518,That it’s had it head bit off by it young.
8519,"So out went the candle, and we were left darkling."
8520,Are you our daughter?
8521,"I would you would make use of that good wisdom,"
8522,Whereof I know you are fraught; and put away
8523,"These dispositions, which of late transform you"
8524,From what you rightly are.
8525,"May not an ass know when the cart draws the horse? Whoop, Jug! I"
8526,Doth any here know me? This is not Lear;
8527,Doth Lear walk thus? speak thus? Where are his eyes?
8528,"Either his notion weakens, his discernings"
8529,Are lethargied. Ha! waking? ’Tis not so!
8530,Who is it that can tell me who I am?
8531,"I would learn that; for by the marks of sovereignty, knowledge and"
8532,"reason, I should be false persuaded I had daughters."
8533,Which they will make an obedient father.
8534,"Your name, fair gentlewoman?"
8535,"This admiration, sir, is much o’ the favour"
8536,Of other your new pranks. I do beseech you
8537,To understand my purposes aright:
8538,"As you are old and reverend, you should be wise."
8539,Here do you keep a hundred knights and squires;
8540,"Men so disorder’d, so debosh’d and bold"
8541,"That this our court, infected with their manners,"
8542,Shows like a riotous inn. Epicurism and lust
8543,Makes it more like a tavern or a brothel
8544,Than a grac’d palace. The shame itself doth speak
8545,"For instant remedy. Be, then, desir’d"
8546,By her that else will take the thing she begs
8547,A little to disquantity your train;
8548,"And the remainder that shall still depend,"
8549,"To be such men as may besort your age,"
8550,"Which know themselves, and you."
8551,Saddle my horses; call my train together.
8552,Degenerate bastard! I’ll not trouble thee:
8553,Yet have I left a daughter.
8554,You strike my people; and your disorder’d rabble
8555,Make servants of their betters.
8556,Woe that too late repents!—
8557,"Is it your will? Speak, sir.—Prepare my horses."
8558,"Ingratitude, thou marble-hearted fiend,"
8559,More hideous when thou show’st thee in a child
8560,"Pray, sir, be patient."
8561,"My train are men of choice and rarest parts,"
8562,That all particulars of duty know;
8563,And in the most exact regard support
8564,"The worships of their name. O most small fault,"
8565,How ugly didst thou in Cordelia show!
8566,"Which, like an engine, wrench’d my frame of nature"
8567,"From the fix’d place; drew from my heart all love,"
8568,"And added to the gall. O Lear, Lear, Lear!"
8569,"And thy dear judgement out! Go, go, my people."
8570,"My lord, I am guiltless, as I am ignorant"
8571,Of what hath moved you.
8572,"It may be so, my lord."
8573,"Hear, nature, hear; dear goddess, hear!"
8574,"Suspend thy purpose, if thou didst intend"
8575,To make this creature fruitful!
8576,Into her womb convey sterility!
8577,Dry up in her the organs of increase;
8578,And from her derogate body never spring
8579,"A babe to honour her! If she must teem,"
8580,"Create her child of spleen, that it may live"
8581,And be a thwart disnatur’d torment to her!
8582,Let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth;
8583,With cadent tears fret channels in her cheeks;
8584,Turn all her mother’s pains and benefits
8585,To laughter and contempt; that she may feel
8586,How sharper than a serpent’s tooth it is
8587,"To have a thankless child! Away, away!"
8588,"Now, gods that we adore, whereof comes this?"
8589,Never afflict yourself to know more of it;
8590,But let his disposition have that scope
8591,That dotage gives it.
8592,"What, fifty of my followers at a clap?"
8593,"What’s the matter, sir?"
8594,I’ll tell thee. [_To Goneril._] Life and death! I am
8595,That thou hast power to shake my manhood thus;
8596,"That these hot tears, which break from me perforce,"
8597,Should make thee worth them. Blasts and fogs upon thee!
8598,Th’untented woundings of a father’s curse
8599,"Pierce every sense about thee! Old fond eyes,"
8600,"Beweep this cause again, I’ll pluck ye out,"
8601,And cast you with the waters that you lose
8602,To temper clay. Ha! Let it be so.
8603,"I have another daughter,"
8604,"Who, I am sure, is kind and comfortable:"
8605,"When she shall hear this of thee, with her nails"
8606,She’ll flay thy wolvish visage. Thou shalt find
8607,That I’ll resume the shape which thou dost think
8608,I have cast off for ever.
8609,Do you mark that?
8610,"I cannot be so partial, Goneril,"
8611,"To the great love I bear you,—"
8612,"Pray you, content. What, Oswald, ho!"
8613,"Nuncle Lear, nuncle Lear, tarry and take the fool with thee."
8614,"A fox when one has caught her,"
8615,"And such a daughter,"
8616,"Should sure to the slaughter,"
8617,If my cap would buy a halter;
8618,So the fool follows after.
8619,This man hath had good counsel.—A hundred knights!
8620,’Tis politic and safe to let him keep
8621,"At point a hundred knights: yes, that on every dream,"
8622,"Each buzz, each fancy, each complaint, dislike,"
8623,"He may enguard his dotage with their powers,"
8624,"And hold our lives in mercy. Oswald, I say!"
8625,"Well, you may fear too far."
8626,Safer than trust too far:
8627,"Let me still take away the harms I fear,"
8628,Not fear still to be taken: I know his heart.
8629,What he hath utter’d I have writ my sister:
8630,"If she sustain him and his hundred knights,"
8631,"When I have show’d th’unfitness,—"
8632,"What, have you writ that letter to my sister?"
8633,"Take you some company, and away to horse:"
8634,Inform her full of my particular fear;
8635,And thereto add such reasons of your own
8636,As may compact it more. Get you gone;
8637,And hasten your return.
8638,"No, no, my lord!"
8639,"This milky gentleness and course of yours,"
8640,"Though I condemn not, yet, under pardon,"
8641,You are much more attask’d for want of wisdom
8642,Than prais’d for harmful mildness.
8643,How far your eyes may pierce I cannot tell:
8644,"Striving to better, oft we mar what’s well."
8645,"Well, well; the event."
8646,SCENE V. Court before the Duke of Albany’s Palace
8647,"Enter Lear, Kent and Fool."
8648,Go you before to Gloucester with these letters: acquaint my
8649,daughter no further with anything you know than comes from her
8650,"demand out of the letter. If your diligence be not speedy, I"
8651,shall be there afore you.
8652,"I will not sleep, my lord, till I have delivered your letter."
8653,"If a man’s brains were in’s heels, were’t not in danger of"
8654,Then I prithee be merry; thy wit shall not go slipshod.
8655,"Shalt see thy other daughter will use thee kindly, for though"
8656,"she’s as like this as a crab’s like an apple, yet I can tell"
8657,what I can tell.
8658,"What canst tell, boy?"
8659,She’ll taste as like this as a crab does to a crab. Thou
8660,canst tell why one’s nose stands i’the middle on’s face?
8661,"Why, to keep one’s eyes of either side’s nose, that what a man"
8662,"cannot smell out, he may spy into."
8663,I did her wrong.
8664,Canst tell how an oyster makes his shell?
8665,Nor I neither; but I can tell why a snail has a house.
8666,"Why, to put’s head in; not to give it away to his daughters, and"
8667,leave his horns without a case.
8668,I will forget my nature. So kind a father! Be my horses ready?
8669,Thy asses are gone about ’em. The reason why the seven stars are
8670,no more than seven is a pretty reason.
8671,Because they are not eight?
8672,Yes indeed: thou wouldst make a good fool.
8673,To tak’t again perforce!—Monster ingratitude!
8674,"If thou wert my fool, nuncle, I’d have thee beaten for being"
8675,old before thy time.
8676,Thou shouldst not have been old till thou hadst been wise.
8677,"O, let me not be mad, not mad, sweet heaven!"
8678,Keep me in temper; I would not be mad!
8679,How now? are the horses ready?
8680,"She that’s a maid now, and laughs at my departure,"
8681,"Shall not be a maid long, unless things be cut shorter."
8682,SCENE I. A court within the Castle of the Earl of Gloucester
8683,"Enter Edmund and Curan, meeting."
8684,"And you, sir. I have been with your father, and given him"
8685,notice that the Duke of Cornwall and Regan his Duchess will be
8686,here with him this night.
8687,"Nay, I know not. You have heard of the news abroad; I mean the"
8688,"whispered ones, for they are yet but ear-kissing arguments?"
8689,"Not I: pray you, what are they?"
8690,"Have you heard of no likely wars toward, ’twixt the two dukes"
8691,of Cornwall and Albany?
8692,"You may do, then, in time. Fare you well, sir."
8693,The Duke be here tonight? The better! best!
8694,This weaves itself perforce into my business.
8695,My father hath set guard to take my brother;
8696,"And I have one thing, of a queasy question,"
8697,Which I must act. Briefness and fortune work!
8698,"Brother, a word, descend, brother, I say!"
8699,"My father watches: O sir, fly this place;"
8700,Intelligence is given where you are hid;
8701,You have now the good advantage of the night.
8702,Have you not spoken ’gainst the Duke of Cornwall?
8703,"He’s coming hither; now, i’ the night, i’ the haste,"
8704,And Regan with him: have you nothing said
8705,Upon his party ’gainst the Duke of Albany?
8706,"I am sure on’t, not a word."
8707,I hear my father coming:—pardon me;
8708,In cunning I must draw my sword upon you:
8709,Draw: seem to defend yourself: now quit you well.
8710,"Yield: come before my father. Light, ho, here!"
8711,"Fly, brother. Torches, torches!—So farewell."
8712,Some blood drawn on me would beget opinion
8713,Of my more fierce endeavour: [_Wounds his arm._]
8714,I have seen drunkards
8715,"Do more than this in sport. Father, father!"
8716,"Stop, stop! No help?"
8717,"Now, Edmund, where’s the villain?"
8718,"Here stood he in the dark, his sharp sword out,"
8719,"Mumbling of wicked charms, conjuring the moon"
8720,To stand auspicious mistress.
8721,But where is he?
8722,"Look, sir, I bleed."
8723,"Where is the villain, Edmund?"
8724,"Fled this way, sir. When by no means he could,—"
8725,"Pursue him, ho! Go after."
8726,—By no means what?
8727,Persuade me to the murder of your lordship;
8728,But that I told him the revenging gods
8729,’Gainst parricides did all their thunders bend;
8730,Spoke with how manifold and strong a bond
8731,"The child was bound to the father; sir, in fine,"
8732,Seeing how loathly opposite I stood
8733,"To his unnatural purpose, in fell motion"
8734,"With his prepared sword, he charges home"
8735,"My unprovided body, latch’d mine arm;"
8736,"But when he saw my best alarum’d spirits,"
8737,"Bold in the quarrel’s right, rous’d to th’encounter,"
8738,"Or whether gasted by the noise I made,"
8739,Full suddenly he fled.
8740,Let him fly far;
8741,Not in this land shall he remain uncaught;
8742,"And found—dispatch’d. The noble Duke my master,"
8743,"My worthy arch and patron, comes tonight:"
8744,"By his authority I will proclaim it,"
8745,"That he which finds him shall deserve our thanks,"
8746,Bringing the murderous coward to the stake;
8747,"He that conceals him, death."
8748,"When I dissuaded him from his intent,"
8749,"And found him pight to do it, with curst speech"
8750,"I threaten’d to discover him: he replied,"
8751,"‘Thou unpossessing bastard! dost thou think,"
8752,"If I would stand against thee, would the reposal"
8753,"Of any trust, virtue, or worth in thee"
8754,Make thy words faith’d? No: what I should deny
8755,"As this I would; ay, though thou didst produce"
8756,"My very character, I’d turn it all"
8757,"To thy suggestion, plot, and damned practice:"
8758,"And thou must make a dullard of the world,"
8759,If they not thought the profits of my death
8760,Were very pregnant and potential spurs
8761,To make thee seek it.
8762,O strange and fast’ned villain!
8763,"Would he deny his letter, said he? I never got him."
8764,"Hark, the Duke’s trumpets! I know not why he comes."
8765,All ports I’ll bar; the villain shall not scape;
8766,"The Duke must grant me that: besides, his picture"
8767,"I will send far and near, that all the kingdom"
8768,"May have due note of him; and of my land,"
8769,"Loyal and natural boy, I’ll work the means"
8770,To make thee capable.
8771,"Enter Cornwall, Regan and"
8772,"How now, my noble friend! since I came hither,"
8773,"Which I can call but now, I have heard strange news."
8774,"If it be true, all vengeance comes too short"
8775,"Which can pursue th’offender. How dost, my lord?"
8776,"O madam, my old heart is crack’d, it’s crack’d!"
8777,"What, did my father’s godson seek your life?"
8778,He whom my father nam’d? your Edgar?
8779,"O lady, lady, shame would have it hid!"
8780,Was he not companion with the riotous knights
8781,That tend upon my father?
8782,"I know not, madam; ’tis too bad, too bad."
8783,"Yes, madam, he was of that consort."
8784,No marvel then though he were ill affected:
8785,"’Tis they have put him on the old man’s death,"
8786,To have the expense and waste of his revenues.
8787,I have this present evening from my sister
8788,Been well inform’d of them; and with such cautions
8789,"That if they come to sojourn at my house,"
8790,I’ll not be there.
8791,"Nor I, assure thee, Regan."
8792,"Edmund, I hear that you have shown your father"
8793,"It was my duty, sir."
8794,He did bewray his practice; and receiv’d
8795,"This hurt you see, striving to apprehend him."
8796,"Ay, my good lord."
8797,"If he be taken, he shall never more"
8798,"Be fear’d of doing harm: make your own purpose,"
8799,"How in my strength you please. For you, Edmund,"
8800,Whose virtue and obedience doth this instant
8801,"So much commend itself, you shall be ours:"
8802,Natures of such deep trust we shall much need;
8803,You we first seize on.
8804,"I shall serve you, sir, truly, however else."
8805,For him I thank your grace.
8806,You know not why we came to visit you?
8807,"Thus out of season, threading dark-ey’d night:"
8808,"Occasions, noble Gloucester, of some poise,"
8809,Wherein we must have use of your advice.
8810,"Our father he hath writ, so hath our sister,"
8811,"Of differences, which I best thought it fit"
8812,To answer from our home; the several messengers
8813,"From hence attend dispatch. Our good old friend,"
8814,Lay comforts to your bosom; and bestow
8815,"Your needful counsel to our business,"
8816,Which craves the instant use.
8817,"I serve you, madam:"
8818,Your graces are right welcome.
8819,SCENE II. Before Gloucester’s Castle
8820,"Enter Kent and Oswald,"
8821,"Good dawning to thee, friend: art of this house?"
8822,Where may we set our horses?
8823,"Prithee, if thou lov’st me, tell me."
8824,I love thee not.
8825,"Why then, I care not for thee."
8826,"If I had thee in Lipsbury pinfold, I would make thee care for me."
8827,Why dost thou use me thus? I know thee not.
8828,"Fellow, I know thee."
8829,What dost thou know me for?
8830,"A knave; a rascal; an eater of broken meats; a base, proud,"
8831,"shallow, beggarly, three-suited, hundred-pound, filthy,"
8832,"worsted-stocking knave; a lily-livered, action-taking, whoreson,"
8833,"glass-gazing, super-serviceable, finical rogue;"
8834,one trunk-inheriting slave; one that wouldst be a bawd in way of
8835,"good service, and art nothing but the composition of a"
8836,"knave, beggar, coward, pander, and the son and heir of a mongrel"
8837,"bitch: one whom I will beat into clamorous whining, if thou"
8838,deniest the least syllable of thy addition.
8839,"Why, what a monstrous fellow art thou, thus to rail on one that’s"
8840,neither known of thee nor knows thee?
8841,"What a brazen-faced varlet art thou, to deny thou knowest me! Is"
8842,it two days ago since I tripped up thy heels and beat thee before
8843,"the King? Draw, you rogue: for, though it be night, yet the moon"
8844,"shines; I’ll make a sop o’ the moonshine of you: draw, you"
8845,"whoreson cullionly barber-monger, draw!"
8846,Away! I have nothing to do with thee.
8847,"Draw, you rascal: you come with letters against the King; and"
8848,take vanity the puppet’s part against the royalty of her father:
8849,"draw, you rogue, or I’ll so carbonado your shanks:—draw, you rascal;"
8850,"Help, ho! murder! help!"
8851,"Strike, you slave; stand, rogue, stand; you neat slave, strike!"
8852,"Help, ho! murder! murder!"
8853,"Enter Edmund, Cornwall, Regan,"
8854,How now! What’s the matter? Part!
8855,"With you, goodman boy, if you please: come, I’ll flesh ye; come"
8856,Weapons! arms! What’s the matter here?
8857,"Keep peace, upon your lives, he dies that strikes again. What is the"
8858,The messengers from our sister and the King.
8859,What is your difference? Speak.
8860,"I am scarce in breath, my lord."
8861,"No marvel, you have so bestirr’d your valour. You cowardly"
8862,"rascal, nature disclaims in thee; a tailor made thee."
8863,Thou art a strange fellow: a tailor make a man?
8864,"Ay, a tailor, sir: a stonecutter or a painter could not have"
8865,"made him so ill, though he had been but two years at the trade."
8866,"Speak yet, how grew your quarrel?"
8867,"This ancient ruffian, sir, whose life I have spared at suit of his grey"
8868,"Thou whoreson zed! thou unnecessary letter! My lord, if you’ll"
8869,"give me leave, I will tread this unbolted villain into mortar and"
8870,"daub the walls of a jakes with him. Spare my grey beard, you wagtail?"
8871,"You beastly knave, know you no reverence?"
8872,"Yes, sir; but anger hath a privilege."
8873,Why art thou angry?
8874,"That such a slave as this should wear a sword,"
8875,"Who wears no honesty. Such smiling rogues as these,"
8876,"Like rats, oft bite the holy cords a-twain"
8877,Which are too intrince t’unloose; smooth every passion
8878,That in the natures of their lords rebel;
8879,"Bring oil to fire, snow to their colder moods;"
8880,"Renege, affirm, and turn their halcyon beaks"
8881,"With every gale and vary of their masters,"
8882,"Knowing naught, like dogs, but following."
8883,A plague upon your epileptic visage!
8884,"Smile you my speeches, as I were a fool?"
8885,"Goose, if I had you upon Sarum plain,"
8886,I’d drive ye cackling home to Camelot.
8887,"What, art thou mad, old fellow?"
8888,How fell you out? Say that.
8889,No contraries hold more antipathy
8890,Than I and such a knave.
8891,Why dost thou call him knave? What is his fault?
8892,His countenance likes me not.
8893,"No more perchance does mine, or his, or hers."
8894,"Sir, ’tis my occupation to be plain:"
8895,I have seen better faces in my time
8896,Than stands on any shoulder that I see
8897,Before me at this instant.
8898,This is some fellow
8899,"Who, having been prais’d for bluntness, doth affect"
8900,"A saucy roughness, and constrains the garb"
8901,"Quite from his nature: he cannot flatter, he,"
8902,"An honest mind and plain, he must speak truth!"
8903,"An they will take it, so; if not, he’s plain."
8904,These kind of knaves I know which in this plainness
8905,Harbour more craft and more corrupter ends
8906,Than twenty silly-ducking observants
8907,That stretch their duties nicely.
8908,"Sir, in good faith, in sincere verity,"
8909,"Under th’allowance of your great aspect,"
8910,"Whose influence, like the wreath of radiant fire"
8911,"On flickering Phoebus’ front,—"
8912,What mean’st by this?
8913,"To go out of my dialect, which you discommend so much. I know,"
8914,"sir, I am no flatterer: he that beguiled you in a plain accent"
8915,"was a plain knave; which, for my part, I will not be, though I"
8916,should win your displeasure to entreat me to’t.
8917,What was the offence you gave him?
8918,I never gave him any:
8919,It pleas’d the King his master very late
8920,"To strike at me, upon his misconstruction;"
8921,"When he, compact, and flattering his displeasure,"
8922,"Tripp’d me behind; being down, insulted, rail’d"
8923,"And put upon him such a deal of man,"
8924,"That worthied him, got praises of the King"
8925,For him attempting who was self-subdu’d;
8926,"And, in the fleshment of this dread exploit,"
8927,Drew on me here again.
8928,None of these rogues and cowards
8929,But Ajax is their fool.
8930,Fetch forth the stocks!
8931,"You stubborn ancient knave, you reverent braggart,"
8932,"Sir, I am too old to learn:"
8933,Call not your stocks for me: I serve the King;
8934,On whose employment I was sent to you:
8935,"You shall do small respect, show too bold malice"
8936,"Against the grace and person of my master,"
8937,Fetch forth the stocks!
8938,"As I have life and honour, there shall he sit till noon."
8939,"Till noon! Till night, my lord; and all night too!"
8940,"Why, madam, if I were your father’s dog,"
8941,You should not use me so.
8942,"Sir, being his knave, I will."
8943,This is a fellow of the selfsame colour
8944,"Our sister speaks of. Come, bring away the stocks!"
8945,Let me beseech your grace not to do so:
8946,"His fault is much, and the good King his master"
8947,Will check him for’t: your purpos’d low correction
8948,Is such as basest and contemned’st wretches
8949,"For pilferings and most common trespasses,"
8950,Are punish’d with. The King must take it ill
8951,"That he, so slightly valued in his messenger,"
8952,Should have him thus restrained.
8953,"My sister may receive it much more worse,"
8954,"To have her gentleman abus’d, assaulted,"
8955,For following her affairs. Put in his legs.
8956,[_Kent is put in the
8957,"Come, my good lord, away."
8958,"I am sorry for thee, friend; ’tis the Duke’s pleasure,"
8959,"Whose disposition, all the world well knows,"
8960,Will not be rubb’d nor stopp’d; I’ll entreat for thee.
8961,"Pray do not, sir: I have watch’d, and travell’d hard;"
8962,"Some time I shall sleep out, the rest I’ll whistle."
8963,A good man’s fortune may grow out at heels:
8964,Give you good morrow!
8965,The Duke’s to blame in this: ’twill be ill taken.
8966,"Good King, that must approve the common saw,"
8967,Thou out of heaven’s benediction com’st
8968,To the warm sun.
8969,"Approach, thou beacon to this under globe,"
8970,That by thy comfortable beams I may
8971,Peruse this letter. Nothing almost sees miracles
8972,"But misery. I know ’tis from Cordelia,"
8973,Who hath most fortunately been inform’d
8974,Of my obscured course. And shall find time
8975,"From this enormous state, seeking to give"
8976,"Losses their remedies. All weary and o’erwatch’d,"
8977,"Take vantage, heavy eyes, not to behold"
8978,"Fortune, good night: smile once more, turn thy wheel!"
8979,SCENE III. The open Country
8980,"I heard myself proclaim’d,"
8981,And by the happy hollow of a tree
8982,"Escap’d the hunt. No port is free, no place"
8983,That guard and most unusual vigilance
8984,Does not attend my taking. While I may scape
8985,I will preserve myself: and am bethought
8986,To take the basest and most poorest shape
8987,"That ever penury in contempt of man,"
8988,"Brought near to beast: my face I’ll grime with filth,"
8989,"Blanket my loins; elf all my hair in knots,"
8990,And with presented nakedness outface
8991,The winds and persecutions of the sky.
8992,The country gives me proof and precedent
8993,"Of Bedlam beggars, who, with roaring voices,"
8994,Strike in their numb’d and mortified bare arms
8995,"Pins, wooden pricks, nails, sprigs of rosemary;"
8996,"And with this horrible object, from low farms,"
8997,"Poor pelting villages, sheep-cotes, and mills,"
8998,"Sometime with lunatic bans, sometime with prayers,"
8999,"Enforce their charity. Poor Turlygod! poor Tom,"
9000,That’s something yet: Edgar I nothing am.
9001,SCENE IV. Before Gloucester’s Castle; Kent in the stocks
9002,"Enter Lear, Fool and Gentleman."
9003,"’Tis strange that they should so depart from home,"
9004,And not send back my messenger.
9005,The night before there was no purpose in them
9006,"Hail to thee, noble master!"
9007,Ha! Mak’st thou this shame thy pastime?
9008,"Ha, ha! he wears cruel garters. Horses are tied by the"
9009,"heads; dogs and bears by the neck, monkeys by the loins, and"
9010,"men by the legs: when a man is overlusty at legs, then he"
9011,What’s he that hath so much thy place mistook
9012,To set thee here?
9013,"It is both he and she,"
9014,Your son and daughter.
9015,"No, no; they would not."
9016,"By Jupiter, I swear no."
9017,"By Juno, I swear ay."
9018,They durst not do’t.
9019,"They could not, would not do’t; ’tis worse than murder,"
9020,To do upon respect such violent outrage:
9021,"Resolve me, with all modest haste, which way"
9022,"Thou mightst deserve or they impose this usage,"
9023,"My lord, when at their home"
9024,"I did commend your highness’ letters to them,"
9025,Ere I was risen from the place that show’d
9026,"My duty kneeling, came there a reeking post,"
9027,"Stew’d in his haste, half breathless, panting forth"
9028,From Goneril his mistress salutations;
9029,"Deliver’d letters, spite of intermission,"
9030,"Which presently they read; on those contents,"
9031,"They summon’d up their meiny, straight took horse;"
9032,Commanded me to follow and attend
9033,The leisure of their answer; gave me cold looks:
9034,"And meeting here the other messenger,"
9035,"Whose welcome I perceiv’d had poison’d mine,"
9036,Being the very fellow which of late
9037,"Display’d so saucily against your highness,"
9038,"Having more man than wit about me, drew;"
9039,He rais’d the house with loud and coward cries.
9040,Your son and daughter found this trespass worth
9041,The shame which here it suffers.
9042,"Winter’s not gone yet, if the wild geese fly that way."
9043,Fathers that wear rags
9044,"Do make their children blind,"
9045,But fathers that bear bags
9046,Shall see their children kind.
9047,"Fortune, that arrant whore,"
9048,Ne’er turns the key to th’ poor.
9049,"But for all this, thou shalt have as many dolours for thy"
9050,daughters as thou canst tell in a year.
9051,"O, how this mother swells up toward my heart!"
9052,"_Hysterica passio_, down, thou climbing sorrow,"
9053,Thy element’s below! Where is this daughter?
9054,"With the earl, sir, here within."
9055,Follow me not; stay here.
9056,Made you no more offence but what you speak of?
9057,How chance the King comes with so small a number?
9058,"An thou hadst been set i’ the stocks for that question,"
9059,thou hadst well deserved it.
9060,"We’ll set thee to school to an ant, to teach thee there’s no"
9061,labouring i’the winter. All that follow their noses are led by
9062,their eyes but blind men; and there’s not a nose among twenty
9063,but can smell him that’s stinking. Let go thy hold when a great
9064,"wheel runs down a hill, lest it break thy neck with following"
9065,"it; but the great one that goes upward, let him draw thee after."
9066,"When a wise man gives thee better counsel, give me mine again: I"
9067,"would have none but knaves follow it, since a fool gives it."
9068,"That sir which serves and seeks for gain,"
9069,"And follows but for form,"
9070,"Will pack when it begins to rain,"
9071,And leave thee in the storm.
9072,"But I will tarry; the fool will stay,"
9073,And let the wise man fly:
9074,The knave turns fool that runs away;
9075,The fool no knave perdy.
9076,"Where learn’d you this, fool?"
9077,"Not i’ the stocks, fool."
9078,Enter Lear and Gloucester.
9079,Deny to speak with me? They are sick? they are weary?
9080,They have travell’d all the night? Mere fetches;
9081,The images of revolt and flying off.
9082,Fetch me a better answer.
9083,You know the fiery quality of the Duke;
9084,How unremovable and fix’d he is
9085,In his own course.
9086,Vengeance! plague! death! confusion!
9087,"Fiery? What quality? Why, Gloucester, Gloucester,"
9088,I’d speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife.
9089,"Well, my good lord, I have inform’d them so."
9090,"Inform’d them! Dost thou understand me, man?"
9091,"Ay, my good lord."
9092,The King would speak with Cornwall; the dear father
9093,"Would with his daughter speak, commands, tends, service,"
9094,Are they inform’d of this? My breath and blood!
9095,"Fiery? The fiery Duke, tell the hot Duke that—"
9096,"No, but not yet: maybe he is not well:"
9097,Infirmity doth still neglect all office
9098,Whereto our health is bound: we are not ourselves
9099,"When nature, being oppress’d, commands the mind"
9100,To suffer with the body: I’ll forbear;
9101,"And am fallen out with my more headier will,"
9102,To take the indispos’d and sickly fit
9103,For the sound man. [_Looking on Kent._]
9104,Death on my state! Wherefore
9105,Should he sit here? This act persuades me
9106,That this remotion of the Duke and her
9107,Is practice only. Give me my servant forth.
9108,"Go tell the Duke and’s wife I’d speak with them,"
9109,"Now, presently: bid them come forth and hear me,"
9110,Or at their chamber door I’ll beat the drum
9111,Till it cry sleep to death.
9112,I would have all well betwixt you.
9113,"O me, my heart, my rising heart! But down!"
9114,"Cry to it, nuncle, as the cockney did to the eels when she put ’em"
9115,i’ the paste alive; she knapped ’em o’ the coxcombs
9116,"with a stick and cried ‘Down, wantons, down!’ ’Twas"
9117,"her brother that, in pure kindness to his horse buttered his hay."
9118,Good morrow to you both.
9119,Hail to your grace!
9120,I am glad to see your highness.
9121,"Regan, I think you are; I know what reason"
9122,"I have to think so: if thou shouldst not be glad,"
9123,"I would divorce me from thy mother’s tomb,"
9124,"Sepulchring an adultress. [_To Kent_] O, are you free?"
9125,"Some other time for that.—Beloved Regan,"
9126,"Thy sister’s naught: O Regan, she hath tied"
9127,"Sharp-tooth’d unkindness, like a vulture, here."
9128,I can scarce speak to thee; thou’lt not believe
9129,With how deprav’d a quality—O Regan!
9130,"I pray you, sir, take patience. I have hope"
9131,You less know how to value her desert
9132,Than she to scant her duty.
9133,"Say, how is that?"
9134,I cannot think my sister in the least
9135,"Would fail her obligation. If, sir, perchance"
9136,"She have restrain’d the riots of your followers,"
9137,"’Tis on such ground, and to such wholesome end,"
9138,As clears her from all blame.
9139,My curses on her.
9140,"O, sir, you are old;"
9141,Nature in you stands on the very verge
9142,Of her confine: you should be rul’d and led
9143,"By some discretion, that discerns your state"
9144,"Better than you yourself. Therefore I pray you,"
9145,That to our sister you do make return;
9146,"Say you have wrong’d her, sir."
9147,Do you but mark how this becomes the house?
9148,"‘Dear daughter, I confess that I am old;"
9149,Age is unnecessary: on my knees I beg
9150,"That you’ll vouchsafe me raiment, bed, and food.’"
9151,"Good sir, no more! These are unsightly tricks:"
9152,Return you to my sister.
9153,She hath abated me of half my train;
9154,"Look’d black upon me; struck me with her tongue,"
9155,"Most serpent-like, upon the very heart."
9156,All the stor’d vengeances of heaven fall
9157,"On her ingrateful top! Strike her young bones,"
9158,"You taking airs, with lameness!"
9159,"You nimble lightnings, dart your blinding flames"
9160,"Into her scornful eyes! Infect her beauty,"
9161,"You fen-suck’d fogs, drawn by the powerful sun,"
9162,To fall and blast her pride!
9163,O the blest gods!
9164,So will you wish on me when the rash mood is on.
9165,"No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse."
9166,Thy tender-hefted nature shall not give
9167,Thee o’er to harshness. Her eyes are fierce; but thine
9168,"Do comfort, and not burn. ’Tis not in thee"
9169,"To grudge my pleasures, to cut off my train,"
9170,"To bandy hasty words, to scant my sizes,"
9171,"And, in conclusion, to oppose the bolt"
9172,Against my coming in. Thou better know’st
9173,"The offices of nature, bond of childhood,"
9174,"Effects of courtesy, dues of gratitude;"
9175,"Thy half o’ the kingdom hast thou not forgot,"
9176,Wherein I thee endow’d.
9177,"Good sir, to the purpose."
9178,Who put my man i’ the stocks?
9179,"I know’t, my sister’s: this approves her letter,"
9180,That she would soon be here.
9181,Is your lady come?
9182,"This is a slave, whose easy borrowed pride"
9183,Dwells in the fickle grace of her he follows.
9184,"Out, varlet, from my sight!"
9185,What means your grace?
9186,"Who stock’d my servant? Regan, I have good hope"
9187,Thou didst not know on’t. Who comes here? O heavens!
9188,"If you do love old men, if your sweet sway"
9189,"Allow obedience, if yourselves are old,"
9190,"Make it your cause; send down, and take my part!"
9191,"O Regan, wilt thou take her by the hand?"
9192,"Why not by the hand, sir? How have I offended?"
9193,All’s not offence that indiscretion finds
9194,And dotage terms so.
9195,"O sides, you are too tough!"
9196,Will you yet hold? How came my man i’ the stocks?
9197,"I set him there, sir: but his own disorders"
9198,Deserv’d much less advancement.
9199,"I pray you, father, being weak, seem so."
9200,"If, till the expiration of your month,"
9201,"You will return and sojourn with my sister,"
9202,"Dismissing half your train, come then to me:"
9203,"I am now from home, and out of that provision"
9204,Which shall be needful for your entertainment.
9205,"Return to her, and fifty men dismiss’d?"
9206,"No, rather I abjure all roofs, and choose"
9207,To wage against the enmity o’ the air;
9208,"To be a comrade with the wolf and owl,"
9209,Necessity’s sharp pinch! Return with her?
9210,"Why, the hot-blooded France, that dowerless took"
9211,"Our youngest born, I could as well be brought"
9212,"To knee his throne, and, squire-like, pension beg"
9213,To keep base life afoot. Return with her?
9214,Persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter
9215,To this detested groom.
9216,"At your choice, sir."
9217,"I prithee, daughter, do not make me mad:"
9218,"I will not trouble thee, my child; farewell:"
9219,"We’ll no more meet, no more see one another."
9220,"But yet thou art my flesh, my blood, my daughter;"
9221,"Or rather a disease that’s in my flesh,"
9222,"Which I must needs call mine. Thou art a boil,"
9223,"A plague sore, or embossed carbuncle"
9224,In my corrupted blood. But I’ll not chide thee;
9225,"Let shame come when it will, I do not call it:"
9226,"I do not bid the thunder-bearer shoot,"
9227,Nor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove:
9228,Mend when thou canst; be better at thy leisure:
9229,"I can be patient; I can stay with Regan,"
9230,I and my hundred knights.
9231,"I look’d not for you yet, nor am provided"
9232,"For your fit welcome. Give ear, sir, to my sister;"
9233,For those that mingle reason with your passion
9234,"Must be content to think you old, and so—"
9235,But she knows what she does.
9236,Is this well spoken?
9237,"I dare avouch it, sir: what, fifty followers?"
9238,Is it not well? What should you need of more?
9239,"Yea, or so many, sith that both charge and danger"
9240,Speak ’gainst so great a number? How in one house
9241,"Should many people, under two commands,"
9242,Hold amity? ’Tis hard; almost impossible.
9243,"Why might not you, my lord, receive attendance"
9244,"From those that she calls servants, or from mine?"
9245,"Why not, my lord? If then they chanc’d to slack ye,"
9246,"We could control them. If you will come to me,—"
9247,"For now I spy a danger,—I entreat you"
9248,To bring but five-and-twenty: to no more
9249,Will I give place or notice.
9250,"I gave you all,—"
9251,And in good time you gave it.
9252,"Made you my guardians, my depositaries;"
9253,But kept a reservation to be followed
9254,"With such a number. What, must I come to you"
9255,"With five-and-twenty, Regan, said you so?"
9256,And speak’t again my lord; no more with me.
9257,Those wicked creatures yet do look well-favour’d
9258,When others are more wicked; not being the worst
9259,Stands in some rank of praise.
9260,"Thy fifty yet doth double five-and-twenty,"
9261,And thou art twice her love.
9262,"Hear me, my lord:"
9263,What need you five-and-twenty? Ten? Or five?
9264,To follow in a house where twice so many
9265,Have a command to tend you?
9266,"O, reason not the need: our basest beggars"
9267,Are in the poorest thing superfluous:
9268,"Allow not nature more than nature needs,"
9269,Man’s life is cheap as beast’s. Thou art a lady;
9270,"If only to go warm were gorgeous,"
9271,"Why, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear’st"
9272,"Which scarcely keeps thee warm. But, for true need,—"
9273,"You heavens, give me that patience, patience I need!"
9274,"You see me here, you gods, a poor old man,"
9275,As full of grief as age; wretched in both!
9276,If it be you that stirs these daughters’ hearts
9277,"Against their father, fool me not so much"
9278,"To bear it tamely; touch me with noble anger,"
9279,"And let not women’s weapons, water-drops,"
9280,"Stain my man’s cheeks! No, you unnatural hags,"
9281,I will have such revenges on you both
9282,"That all the world shall,—I will do such things,—"
9283,"What they are yet, I know not; but they shall be"
9284,The terrors of the earth. You think I’ll weep;
9285,"No, I’ll not weep:— [_Storm and tempest._]"
9286,I have full cause of weeping; but this heart
9287,Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws
9288,"Or ere I’ll weep.—O fool, I shall go mad!"
9289,Let us withdraw; ’twill be a storm.
9290,This house is little: the old man and his people
9291,Cannot be well bestow’d.
9292,’Tis his own blame; hath put himself from rest
9293,And must needs taste his folly.
9294,"For his particular, I’ll receive him gladly,"
9295,But not one follower.
9296,So am I purpos’d.
9297,Where is my lord of Gloucester?
9298,"Followed the old man forth, he is return’d."
9299,The King is in high rage.
9300,Whither is he going?
9301,He calls to horse; but will I know not whither.
9302,’Tis best to give him way; he leads himself.
9303,"My lord, entreat him by no means to stay."
9304,"Alack, the night comes on, and the high winds"
9305,Do sorely ruffle; for many miles about
9306,There’s scarce a bush.
9307,"O, sir, to wilful men"
9308,The injuries that they themselves procure
9309,Must be their schoolmasters. Shut up your doors.
9310,"He is attended with a desperate train,"
9311,"And what they may incense him to, being apt"
9312,"To have his ear abus’d, wisdom bids fear."
9313,"Shut up your doors, my lord; ’tis a wild night."
9314,My Regan counsels well: come out o’ the storm.
9315,SCENE I. A Heath
9316,"A storm with thunder and lightning. Enter Kent and a Gentleman,"
9317,"Who’s there, besides foul weather?"
9318,"One minded like the weather, most unquietly."
9319,I know you. Where’s the King?
9320,Contending with the fretful elements;
9321,"Bids the wind blow the earth into the sea,"
9322,"Or swell the curled waters ’bove the main,"
9323,"That things might change or cease; tears his white hair,"
9324,"Which the impetuous blasts with eyeless rage,"
9325,Catch in their fury and make nothing of;
9326,Strives in his little world of man to outscorn
9327,The to-and-fro-conflicting wind and rain.
9328,"This night, wherein the cub-drawn bear would couch,"
9329,The lion and the belly-pinched wolf
9330,"Keep their fur dry, unbonneted he runs,"
9331,And bids what will take all.
9332,But who is with him?
9333,"None but the fool, who labours to out-jest"
9334,"Sir, I do know you;"
9335,"And dare, upon the warrant of my note"
9336,"Commend a dear thing to you. There is division,"
9337,Although as yet the face of it be cover’d
9338,"With mutual cunning, ’twixt Albany and Cornwall;"
9339,"Who have, as who have not, that their great stars"
9340,"Throne’d and set high; servants, who seem no less,"
9341,Which are to France the spies and speculations
9342,"Intelligent of our state. What hath been seen,"
9343,Either in snuffs and packings of the Dukes;
9344,Or the hard rein which both of them have borne
9345,"Against the old kind King; or something deeper,"
9346,"Whereof, perchance, these are but furnishings;—"
9347,"But, true it is, from France there comes a power"
9348,"Into this scatter’d kingdom; who already,"
9349,"Wise in our negligence, have secret feet"
9350,"In some of our best ports, and are at point"
9351,To show their open banner.—Now to you:
9352,If on my credit you dare build so far
9353,"To make your speed to Dover, you shall find"
9354,Some that will thank you making just report
9355,Of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow
9356,The King hath cause to plain.
9357,I am a gentleman of blood and breeding;
9358,And from some knowledge and assurance
9359,Offer this office to you.
9360,I will talk further with you.
9361,For confirmation that I am much more
9362,"Than my out-wall, open this purse, and take"
9363,"What it contains. If you shall see Cordelia,"
9364,"As fear not but you shall, show her this ring;"
9365,And she will tell you who your fellow is
9366,That yet you do not know. Fie on this storm!
9367,I will go seek the King.
9368,Give me your hand: have you no more to say?
9369,"Few words, but, to effect, more than all yet:"
9370,"That, when we have found the King, in which your pain"
9371,"That way, I’ll this; he that first lights on him"
9372,SCENE II. Another part of the heath
9373,Storm continues. Enter Lear
9374,"Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! Rage! blow!"
9375,"You cataracts and hurricanoes, spout"
9376,"Till you have drench’d our steeples, drown’d the cocks!"
9377,"You sulphurous and thought-executing fires,"
9378,"Vaunt-couriers to oak-cleaving thunderbolts,"
9379,"Singe my white head! And thou, all-shaking thunder,"
9380,Strike flat the thick rotundity o’ the world!
9381,"Crack nature’s moulds, all germens spill at once,"
9382,That make ingrateful man!
9383,"O nuncle, court holy-water in a dry house is better than this"
9384,"rain-water out o’ door. Good nuncle, in; and ask thy daughters"
9385,blessing: here’s a night pities neither wise men nor fools.
9386,"Rumble thy bellyful! Spit, fire! spout, rain!"
9387,"Nor rain, wind, thunder, fire are my daughters;"
9388,"I tax not you, you elements, with unkindness."
9389,"I never gave you kingdom, call’d you children;"
9390,You owe me no subscription: then let fall
9391,"Your horrible pleasure. Here I stand your slave,"
9392,"A poor, infirm, weak, and despis’d old man:"
9393,"But yet I call you servile ministers,"
9394,That will with two pernicious daughters join
9395,Your high-engender’d battles ’gainst a head
9396,So old and white as this! O! O! ’tis foul!
9397,He that has a house to put’s head in has a good head-piece.
9398,The codpiece that will house
9399,"Before the head has any,"
9400,The head and he shall louse:
9401,So beggars marry many.
9402,The man that makes his toe
9403,What he his heart should make
9404,"Shall of a corn cry woe,"
9405,And turn his sleep to wake.
9406,For there was never yet fair woman but she made mouths in a glass.
9407,"No, I will be the pattern of all patience;"
9408,I will say nothing.
9409,"Marry, here’s grace and a codpiece; that’s a wise man and a"
9410,"Alas, sir, are you here? Things that love night"
9411,Love not such nights as these; the wrathful skies
9412,"Gallow the very wanderers of the dark,"
9413,"And make them keep their caves. Since I was man,"
9414,"Such sheets of fire, such bursts of horrid thunder,"
9415,Such groans of roaring wind and rain I never
9416,Remember to have heard. Man’s nature cannot carry
9417,"Th’affliction, nor the fear."
9418,"Let the great gods,"
9419,"That keep this dreadful pudder o’er our heads,"
9420,"Find out their enemies now. Tremble, thou wretch,"
9421,That hast within thee undivulged crimes
9422,"Unwhipp’d of justice. Hide thee, thou bloody hand;"
9423,"Thou perjur’d, and thou simular of virtue"
9424,"That art incestuous. Caitiff, to pieces shake"
9425,That under covert and convenient seeming
9426,"Hast practis’d on man’s life: close pent-up guilts,"
9427,"Rive your concealing continents, and cry"
9428,These dreadful summoners grace. I am a man
9429,More sinn’d against than sinning.
9430,"Gracious my lord, hard by here is a hovel;"
9431,Some friendship will it lend you ’gainst the tempest:
9432,"Repose you there, whilst I to this hard house,—"
9433,More harder than the stones whereof ’tis rais’d;
9434,"Which even but now, demanding after you,"
9435,"Denied me to come in,—return, and force"
9436,My wits begin to turn.
9437,"Come on, my boy. How dost, my boy? Art cold?"
9438,"I am cold myself. Where is this straw, my fellow?"
9439,"The art of our necessities is strange,"
9440,"That can make vile things precious. Come, your hovel."
9441,"Poor fool and knave, I have one part in my heart"
9442,That’s sorry yet for thee.
9443,"He that has and a little tiny wit,"
9444,"With heigh-ho, the wind and the rain,"
9445,"Must make content with his fortunes fit,"
9446,Though the rain it raineth every day.
9447,"True, boy. Come, bring us to this hovel."
9448,This is a brave night to cool a courtezan. I’ll speak a prophecy
9449,When priests are more in word than matter;
9450,When brewers mar their malt with water;
9451,When nobles are their tailors’ tutors;
9452,"No heretics burn’d, but wenches’ suitors;"
9453,When every case in law is right;
9454,"No squire in debt, nor no poor knight;"
9455,When slanders do not live in tongues;
9456,Nor cut-purses come not to throngs;
9457,When usurers tell their gold i’ the field;
9458,"And bawds and whores do churches build,"
9459,Then shall the realm of Albion
9460,Come to great confusion:
9461,"Then comes the time, who lives to see’t,"
9462,That going shall be us’d with feet.
9463,This prophecy Merlin shall make; for I live before his time.
9464,SCENE III. A Room in Gloucester’s Castle
9465,Enter Gloucester and Edmund.
9466,"Alack, alack, Edmund, I like not this unnatural dealing. When I"
9467,"desired their leave that I might pity him, they took from me the"
9468,"use of mine own house; charged me on pain of perpetual displeasure,"
9469,"neither to speak of him, entreat for him, or any way sustain him."
9470,Most savage and unnatural!
9471,"Go to; say you nothing. There is division between the Dukes,"
9472,and a worse matter than that: I have received a letter this
9473,night;—’tis dangerous to be spoken;—I have locked the letter
9474,in my closet: these injuries the King now bears will be revenged
9475,home; there’s part of a power already footed: we must incline to
9476,"the King. I will look him, and privily relieve him: go you and"
9477,"maintain talk with the Duke, that my charity be not of him"
9478,"perceived: if he ask for me, I am ill, and gone to bed. If I"
9479,"die for it, as no less is threatened me, the King my old master"
9480,"must be relieved. There is some strange thing toward, Edmund;"
9481,pray you be careful.
9482,"This courtesy, forbid thee, shall the Duke"
9483,Instantly know; and of that letter too.
9484,"This seems a fair deserving, and must draw me"
9485,"That which my father loses, no less than all:"
9486,The younger rises when the old doth fall.
9487,SCENE IV. A part of the Heath with a Hovel
9488,"Storm continues. Enter Lear,"
9489,"Here is the place, my lord; good my lord, enter:"
9490,The tyranny of the open night’s too rough
9491,For nature to endure.
9492,"Good my lord, enter here."
9493,Wilt break my heart?
9494,"I had rather break mine own. Good my lord, enter."
9495,Thou think’st ’tis much that this contentious storm
9496,"Invades us to the skin: so ’tis to thee,"
9497,"But where the greater malady is fix’d,"
9498,The lesser is scarce felt. Thou’dst shun a bear;
9499,"But if thy flight lay toward the raging sea,"
9500,Thou’dst meet the bear i’ the mouth. When the mind’s
9501,The body’s delicate: the tempest in my mind
9502,Doth from my senses take all feeling else
9503,Save what beats there. Filial ingratitude!
9504,Is it not as this mouth should tear this hand
9505,For lifting food to’t? But I will punish home;
9506,"No, I will weep no more. In such a night"
9507,To shut me out! Pour on; I will endure:
9508,"In such a night as this! O Regan, Goneril!"
9509,"Your old kind father, whose frank heart gave all,"
9510,"O, that way madness lies; let me shun that;"
9511,No more of that.
9512,"Good my lord, enter here."
9513,Prithee go in thyself; seek thine own ease:
9514,This tempest will not give me leave to ponder
9515,On things would hurt me more. But I’ll go in.
9516,"Nay, get thee in. I’ll pray, and then I’ll sleep."
9517,"Poor naked wretches, wheresoe’er you are,"
9518,"That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm,"
9519,"How shall your houseless heads and unfed sides,"
9520,"Your loop’d and window’d raggedness, defend you"
9521,"From seasons such as these? O, I have ta’en"
9522,"Too little care of this! Take physic, pomp;"
9523,"Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,"
9524,That thou mayst shake the superflux to them
9525,And show the heavens more just.
9526,"Come not in here, nuncle, here’s a spirit."
9527,"Help me, help me!"
9528,Give me thy hand. Who’s there?
9529,"A spirit, a spirit: he says his name’s poor Tom."
9530,What art thou that dost grumble there i’ the straw?
9531,"Enter Edgar, disguised as a"
9532,Away! the foul fiend follows me! Through the sharp hawthorn blows the
9533,"cold wind. Humh! go to thy cold bed, and warm thee."
9534,Didst thou give all to thy two daughters?
9535,And art thou come to this?
9536,Who gives anything to poor Tom? Whom the foul fiend hath led
9537,"through fire and through flame, through ford and whirlpool, o’er"
9538,bog and quagmire; that hath laid knives under his pillow and
9539,"halters in his pew, set ratsbane by his porridge; made him proud"
9540,"of heart, to ride on a bay trotting horse over four-inched"
9541,"bridges, to course his own shadow for a traitor. Bless thy five"
9542,"wits! 	Tom’s a-cold. O, do, de, do, de, do, de. Bless thee from"
9543,"whirlwinds, star-blasting, and taking! Do poor Tom some charity,"
9544,"whom the foul fiend vexes. There could I have him now, and"
9545,"there,—and there again, and there."
9546,"What, have his daughters brought him to this pass?"
9547,Couldst thou save nothing? Didst thou give ’em all?
9548,"Nay, he reserv’d a blanket, else we had been all shamed."
9549,Now all the plagues that in the pendulous air
9550,Hang fated o’er men’s faults light on thy daughters!
9551,"He hath no daughters, sir."
9552,"Death, traitor! nothing could have subdu’d nature"
9553,To such a lowness but his unkind daughters.
9554,Is it the fashion that discarded fathers
9555,Should have thus little mercy on their flesh?
9556,Judicious punishment! ’twas this flesh begot
9557,"Pillicock sat on Pillicock hill,"
9558,"Alow, alow, loo loo!"
9559,This cold night will turn us all to fools and madmen.
9560,Take heed o’ th’ foul fiend: obey thy parents; keep thy word
9561,justly; swear not; commit not with man’s sworn spouse; set not
9562,thy sweet-heart on proud array. Tom’s a-cold.
9563,What hast thou been?
9564,"A serving-man, proud in heart and mind; that curled my hair;"
9565,"wore gloves in my cap; served the lust of my mistress’ heart, and"
9566,did the act of darkness with her; swore as many oaths as I spake
9567,"words, and broke them in the sweet face of heaven. One that"
9568,"slept in the contriving of lust, and waked to do it. Wine loved"
9569,"I deeply, dice dearly; and in woman out-paramour’d the Turk."
9570,"False of heart, light of ear, bloody of hand; hog in sloth, fox"
9571,"in stealth, wolf in greediness, dog in madness, lion in prey."
9572,Let not the creaking of shoes nor the rustling of silks betray
9573,"thy poor heart to woman. Keep thy foot out of brothels, thy hand"
9574,"out of plackets, thy pen from lender’s book, and defy the foul"
9575,fiend. Still through the hawthorn blows the cold wind: says
9576,"suum, mun, nonny. Dolphin my boy, boy, sessa! let him trot by."
9577,"Why, thou wert better in thy grave than to answer with thy uncovered"
9578,body this extremity of the skies. Is man no more than this? Consider
9579,"him well. Thou owest the worm no silk, the beast no hide, the sheep no"
9580,"wool, the cat no perfume. Ha! here’s three on’s are"
9581,sophisticated! Thou art the thing itself: unaccommodated man is no more
9582,"but such a poor, bare, forked animal as thou art. Off, off, you"
9583,"lendings! Come, unbutton here."
9584,"Prithee, nuncle, be contented; ’tis a naughty night to swim"
9585,in. Now a little fire in a wild field were like an old lecher’s
9586,"heart, a small spark, all the rest on’s body cold. Look, here"
9587,comes a walking fire.
9588,"This is the foul fiend Flibbertigibbet: he begins at curfew, and walks"
9589,"till the first cock; he gives the web and the pin, squints the eye, and"
9590,"makes the harelip; mildews the white wheat, and hurts the poor creature"
9591,Swithold footed thrice the old;
9592,"He met the nightmare, and her nine-fold;"
9593,"Bid her alight and her troth plight,"
9594,"And aroint thee, witch, aroint thee!"
9595,How fares your grace?
9596,Enter Gloucester with a
9597,Who’s there? What is’t you seek?
9598,What are you there? Your names?
9599,"Poor Tom; that eats the swimming frog, the toad, the todpole, the"
9600,"wall-newt and the water; that in the fury of his heart, when the"
9601,"foul fiend rages, eats cow-dung for sallets; swallows the old rat"
9602,and the ditch-dog; drinks the green mantle of the standing pool;
9603,"who is whipped from tithing to tithing, and stocked, punished,"
9604,"and imprisoned; who hath had three suits to his back, six shirts"
9605,"Horse to ride, and weapon to wear."
9606,"But mice and rats and such small deer,"
9607,Have been Tom’s food for seven long year.
9608,"Beware my follower. Peace, Smulkin; peace, thou fiend!"
9609,"What, hath your grace no better company?"
9610,The prince of darkness is a gentleman:
9611,"Modo he’s call’d, and Mahu."
9612,"Our flesh and blood, my lord, is grown so vile"
9613,That it doth hate what gets it.
9614,Go in with me: my duty cannot suffer
9615,T’obey in all your daughters’ hard commands;
9616,"Though their injunction be to bar my doors,"
9617,"And let this tyrannous night take hold upon you,"
9618,"Yet have I ventur’d to come seek you out,"
9619,And bring you where both fire and food is ready.
9620,First let me talk with this philosopher.
9621,What is the cause of thunder?
9622,"Good my lord, take his offer; go into the house."
9623,I’ll talk a word with this same learned Theban.
9624,What is your study?
9625,How to prevent the fiend and to kill vermin.
9626,Let me ask you one word in private.
9627,"Importune him once more to go, my lord;"
9628,His wits begin t’unsettle.
9629,Canst thou blame him?
9630,"His daughters seek his death. Ah, that good Kent!"
9631,"He said it would be thus, poor banish’d man!"
9632,"Thou sayest the King grows mad; I’ll tell thee, friend,"
9633,"I am almost mad myself. I had a son,"
9634,Now outlaw’d from my blood; he sought my life
9635,"But lately, very late: I lov’d him, friend,"
9636,"No father his son dearer: true to tell thee,"
9637,The grief hath craz’d my wits. What a night’s this!
9638,I do beseech your grace.
9639,"O, cry you mercy, sir."
9640,"Noble philosopher, your company."
9641,"In, fellow, there, into the hovel; keep thee warm."
9642,"Come, let’s in all."
9643,"This way, my lord."
9644,I will keep still with my philosopher.
9645,"Good my lord, soothe him; let him take the fellow."
9646,Take him you on.
9647,"Sirrah, come on; go along with us."
9648,"No words, no words, hush."
9649,"Child Rowland to the dark tower came,"
9650,"His word was still—Fie, foh, and fum,"
9651,I smell the blood of a British man.
9652,SCENE V. A Room in Gloucester’s Castle
9653,Enter Cornwall and Edmund.
9654,I will have my revenge ere I depart his house.
9655,"How, my lord, I may be censured, that nature thus gives way to"
9656,"loyalty, something fears me to think of."
9657,I now perceive it was not altogether your brother’s evil
9658,"disposition made him seek his death; but a provoking merit, set"
9659,a-work by a reproveable badness in himself.
9660,"How malicious is my fortune, that I must repent to be just! This"
9661,"is the letter he spoke of, which approves him an intelligent"
9662,party to the advantages of France. O heavens! that this treason
9663,were not; or not I the detector!
9664,Go with me to the Duchess.
9665,"If the matter of this paper be certain, you have mighty business"
9666,"True or false, it hath made thee Earl of Gloucester. Seek out"
9667,"where thy father is, that he may be ready for our apprehension."
9668,"suspicion more fully. I will persever in my course of loyalty,"
9669,though the conflict be sore between that and my blood.
9670,I will lay trust upon thee; and thou shalt find a dearer father
9671,SCENE VI. A Chamber in a Farmhouse adjoining the Castle
9672,"Enter Gloucester, Lear, Kent,"
9673,Here is better than the open air; take it thankfully. I will
9674,piece out the comfort with what addition I can: I will not be
9675,All the power of his wits have given way to his impatience:—
9676,the gods reward your kindness!
9677,Frateretto calls me; and tells me Nero is an angler in the lake
9678,"of darkness. Pray, innocent, and beware the foul fiend."
9679,"Prithee, nuncle, tell me whether a madman be a gentleman or a"
9680,"A king, a king!"
9681,"No, he’s a yeoman that has a gentleman to his son; for he’s a mad"
9682,yeoman that sees his son a gentleman before him.
9683,To have a thousand with red burning spits
9684,Come hissing in upon ’em.
9685,The foul fiend bites my back.
9686,"He’s mad that trusts in the tameness of a wolf, a horse’s health,"
9687,"a boy’s love, or a whore’s oath."
9688,It shall be done; I will arraign them straight.
9689,"Look, where he stands and glares! Want’st thou eyes at trial, madam?"
9690,"Come o’er the bourn, Bessy, to me."
9691,"Her boat hath a leak,"
9692,And she must not speak
9693,Why she dares not come over to thee.
9694,The foul fiend haunts poor Tom in the voice of a nightingale.
9695,"Hoppedance cries in Tom’s belly for two white herring. Croak not, black"
9696,angel; I have no food for thee.
9697,"How do you, sir? Stand you not so amaz’d;"
9698,Will you lie down and rest upon the cushions?
9699,I’ll see their trial first. Bring in their evidence.
9700,"Bench by his side. [_To Kent._] You are o’ the commission,"
9701,Let us deal justly.
9702,"Sleepest or wakest thou, jolly shepherd?"
9703,Thy sheep be in the corn;
9704,And for one blast of thy minikin mouth
9705,Thy sheep shall take no harm.
9706,Purr! the cat is grey.
9707,Arraign her first; ’tis Goneril. I here take my oath before
9708,"this honourable assembly, she kicked the poor King her father."
9709,"Come hither, mistress. Is your name Goneril?"
9710,She cannot deny it.
9711,"Cry you mercy, I took you for a joint-stool."
9712,"And here’s another, whose warp’d looks proclaim"
9713,What store her heart is made on. Stop her there!
9714,"Arms, arms! sword! fire! Corruption in the place!"
9715,"False justicer, why hast thou let her ’scape?"
9716,Bless thy five wits!
9717,"O pity! Sir, where is the patience now"
9718,That you so oft have boasted to retain?
9719,They mar my counterfeiting.
9720,"The little dogs and all,"
9721,"Trey, Blanch, and Sweetheart, see, they bark at me."
9722,"Tom will throw his head at them. Avaunt, you curs!"
9723,"Be thy mouth or black or white,"
9724,Tooth that poisons if it bite;
9725,"Mastiff, greyhound, mongrel grim,"
9726,"Hound or spaniel, brach or him,"
9727,"Or bobtail tike or trundle-tail,"
9728,Tom will make them weep and wail;
9729,"For, with throwing thus my head,"
9730,"Dogs leap the hatch, and all are fled."
9731,"Do, de, de, de. Sessa! Come, march to wakes and fairs and market towns."
9732,"Poor Tom, thy horn is dry."
9733,Then let them anatomize Regan; see what breeds about her
9734,heart. Is there any cause in nature that makes these hard
9735,"hearts? [_To Edgar._] You, sir, I entertain you for one of my"
9736,hundred; only I do not like the fashion of your garments. You’ll
9737,say they are Persian; but let them be changed.
9738,"Now, good my lord, lie here and rest awhile."
9739,"Make no noise, make no noise; draw the curtains."
9740,"So, so. We’ll go to supper i’ the morning."
9741,And I’ll go to bed at noon.
9742,Where is the King my master?
9743,"Here, sir; but trouble him not, his wits are gone."
9744,"Good friend, I prithee, take him in thy arms;"
9745,I have o’erheard a plot of death upon him;
9746,There is a litter ready; lay him in’t
9747,"And drive towards Dover, friend, where thou shalt meet"
9748,Both welcome and protection. Take up thy master;
9749,"If thou shouldst dally half an hour, his life,"
9750,"With thine, and all that offer to defend him,"
9751,"Stand in assured loss. Take up, take up;"
9752,"And follow me, that will to some provision"
9753,Give thee quick conduct.
9754,"This rest might yet have balm’d thy broken sinews,"
9755,"Which, if convenience will not allow,"
9756,"Stand in hard cure. Come, help to bear thy master;"
9757,"When we our betters see bearing our woes,"
9758,We scarcely think our miseries our foes.
9759,"Who alone suffers, suffers most i’ the mind,"
9760,Leaving free things and happy shows behind:
9761,But then the mind much sufferance doth o’erskip
9762,"When grief hath mates, and bearing fellowship."
9763,"How light and portable my pain seems now,"
9764,When that which makes me bend makes the King bow;
9765,"He childed as I fathered! Tom, away!"
9766,"Mark the high noises; and thyself bewray,"
9767,"When false opinion, whose wrong thoughts defile thee,"
9768,In thy just proof repeals and reconciles thee.
9769,"What will hap more tonight, safe ’scape the King!"
9770,SCENE VII. A Room in Gloucester’s Castle
9771,"Enter Cornwall, Regan, Goneril,"
9772,"Post speedily to my lord your husband, show him this letter: the army"
9773,of France is landed. Seek out the traitor Gloucester.
9774,Pluck out his eyes.
9775,"Leave him to my displeasure. Edmund, keep you our sister"
9776,company: the revenges we are bound to take upon your traitorous
9777,father are not fit for your beholding. Advise the Duke where you
9778,"are going, to a most festinate preparation: we are bound to the"
9779,like. Our posts shall be swift and intelligent betwixt us.
9780,"Farewell, dear sister, farewell, my lord of Gloucester."
9781,How now! Where’s the King?
9782,My lord of Gloucester hath convey’d him hence:
9783,"Some five or six and thirty of his knights,"
9784,"Hot questrists after him, met him at gate;"
9785,"Who, with some other of the lord’s dependants,"
9786,Are gone with him toward Dover: where they boast
9787,To have well-armed friends.
9788,Get horses for your mistress.
9789,"Farewell, sweet lord, and sister."
9790,"Go seek the traitor Gloucester,"
9791,"Pinion him like a thief, bring him before us."
9792,Though well we may not pass upon his life
9793,"Without the form of justice, yet our power"
9794,"Shall do a courtesy to our wrath, which men"
9795,"May blame, but not control. Who’s there? The traitor?"
9796,Ingrateful fox! ’tis he.
9797,Bind fast his corky arms.
9798,What mean your graces?
9799,"Good my friends, consider you are my guests."
9800,"Do me no foul play, friends."
9801,"Bind him, I say."
9802,"Hard, hard. O filthy traitor!"
9803,"Unmerciful lady as you are, I’m none."
9804,"To this chair bind him. Villain, thou shalt find—"
9805,"By the kind gods, ’tis most ignobly done"
9806,To pluck me by the beard.
9807,"So white, and such a traitor!"
9808,These hairs which thou dost ravish from my chin
9809,"Will quicken, and accuse thee. I am your host:"
9810,With robber’s hands my hospitable favours
9811,You should not ruffle thus. What will you do?
9812,"Come, sir, what letters had you late from France?"
9813,"Be simple answer’d, for we know the truth."
9814,"And what confederacy have you with the traitors,"
9815,Late footed in the kingdom?
9816,To whose hands have you sent the lunatic King?
9817,"I have a letter guessingly set down,"
9818,"Which came from one that’s of a neutral heart,"
9819,And not from one oppos’d.
9820,Where hast thou sent the King?
9821,"Wherefore to Dover? Wast thou not charg’d at peril,—"
9822,Wherefore to Dover? Let him first answer that.
9823,"I am tied to the stake, and I must stand the course."
9824,"Wherefore to Dover, sir?"
9825,Because I would not see thy cruel nails
9826,Pluck out his poor old eyes; nor thy fierce sister
9827,In his anointed flesh stick boarish fangs.
9828,"The sea, with such a storm as his bare head"
9829,"In hell-black night endur’d, would have buoy’d up,"
9830,And quench’d the stelled fires;
9831,"Yet, poor old heart, he holp the heavens to rain."
9832,"If wolves had at thy gate howl’d that stern time,"
9833,"Thou shouldst have said, ‘Good porter, turn the key.’"
9834,All cruels else subscrib’d: but I shall see
9835,The winged vengeance overtake such children.
9836,"See’t shalt thou never. Fellows, hold the chair."
9837,Upon these eyes of thine I’ll set my foot.
9838,"[_Gloucester is held down in his chair, while Cornwall plucks out one"
9839,of his eyes and sets his foot on it._]
9840,"He that will think to live till he be old,"
9841,Give me some help!—O cruel! O you gods!
9842,One side will mock another; the other too!
9843,If you see vengeance—
9844,"Hold your hand, my lord:"
9845,I have serv’d you ever since I was a child;
9846,But better service have I never done you
9847,Than now to bid you hold.
9848,"How now, you dog!"
9849,"If you did wear a beard upon your chin,"
9850,I’d shake it on this quarrel. What do you mean?
9851,"Nay, then, come on, and take the chance of anger."
9852,"O, I am slain! My lord, you have one eye left"
9853,To see some mischief on him. O!
9854,"Lest it see more, prevent it. Out, vile jelly!"
9855,Where is thy lustre now?
9856,All dark and comfortless. Where’s my son Edmund?
9857,"Edmund, enkindle all the sparks of nature"
9858,To quit this horrid act.
9859,Thou call’st on him that hates thee: it was he
9860,That made the overture of thy treasons to us;
9861,Who is too good to pity thee.
9862,O my follies! Then Edgar was abus’d.
9863,"Kind gods, forgive me that, and prosper him!"
9864,"Go thrust him out at gates, and let him smell"
9865,"His way to Dover. How is’t, my lord? How look you?"
9866,"I have receiv’d a hurt: follow me, lady."
9867,Turn out that eyeless villain. Throw this slave
9868,"Upon the dunghill. Regan, I bleed apace:"
9869,Untimely comes this hurt: give me your arm.
9870,"[_Exit Cornwall, led by Regan; Servants unbind Gloucester and lead"
9871,"I’ll never care what wickedness I do,"
9872,If this man come to good.
9873,"If she live long,"
9874,"And in the end meet the old course of death,"
9875,Women will all turn monsters.
9876,"Let’s follow the old Earl, and get the bedlam"
9877,To lead him where he would: his roguish madness
9878,Allows itself to anything.
9879,Go thou: I’ll fetch some flax and whites of eggs
9880,To apply to his bleeding face. Now heaven help him!
9881,SCENE I. The heath
9882,"Yet better thus, and known to be contemn’d,"
9883,"Than still contemn’d and flatter’d. To be worst,"
9884,"The lowest and most dejected thing of fortune,"
9885,"Stands still in esperance, lives not in fear:"
9886,The lamentable change is from the best;
9887,"The worst returns to laughter. Welcome then,"
9888,Thou unsubstantial air that I embrace;
9889,The wretch that thou hast blown unto the worst
9890,Owes nothing to thy blasts.
9891,"Enter Gloucester, led by an"
9892,"But who comes here? My father, poorly led?"
9893,"World, world, O world!"
9894,"But that thy strange mutations make us hate thee,"
9895,Life would not yield to age.
9896,"O my good lord, I have been your tenant, and your father’s tenant"
9897,"Away, get thee away; good friend, be gone."
9898,Thy comforts can do me no good at all;
9899,Thee they may hurt.
9900,You cannot see your way.
9901,"I have no way, and therefore want no eyes;"
9902,I stumbled when I saw. Full oft ’tis seen
9903,"Our means secure us, and our mere defects"
9904,"Prove our commodities. O dear son Edgar,"
9905,The food of thy abused father’s wrath!
9906,"Might I but live to see thee in my touch,"
9907,I’d say I had eyes again!
9908,How now! Who’s there?
9909,I am worse than e’er I was.
9910,’Tis poor mad Tom.
9911,So long as we can say ‘This is the worst.’
9912,Is it a beggar-man?
9913,"Madman, and beggar too."
9914,"He has some reason, else he could not beg."
9915,I’ the last night’s storm I such a fellow saw;
9916,Which made me think a man a worm. My son
9917,"Came then into my mind, and yet my mind"
9918,Was then scarce friends with him.
9919,I have heard more since.
9920,"As flies to wanton boys are we to the gods,"
9921,They kill us for their sport.
9922,"Bad is the trade that must play fool to sorrow,"
9923,"Angering itself and others. Bless thee, master!"
9924,Is that the naked fellow?
9925,Then prithee get thee away. If for my sake
9926,"Thou wilt o’ertake us hence a mile or twain,"
9927,"I’ the way toward Dover, do it for ancient love,"
9928,"And bring some covering for this naked soul,"
9929,Which I’ll entreat to lead me.
9930,"Alack, sir, he is mad."
9931,’Tis the time’s plague when madmen lead the blind.
9932,"Do as I bid thee, or rather do thy pleasure;"
9933,"Above the rest, be gone."
9934,"I’ll bring him the best ’parel that I have,"
9935,Come on’t what will.
9936,Know’st thou the way to Dover?
9937,"Both stile and gate, horseway and footpath. Poor Tom hath been"
9938,"scared out of his good wits. Bless thee, good man’s son, from"
9939,the foul fiend! Five fiends have been in poor Tom at once; of
9940,"lust, as Obidicut; Hobbididence, prince of darkness; Mahu, of"
9941,"stealing; Modo, of murder; Flibbertigibbet, of mopping and"
9942,"mowing, who since possesses chambermaids and waiting women. So,"
9943,"Here, take this purse, thou whom the heaven’s plagues"
9944,Have humbled to all strokes: that I am wretched
9945,Makes thee the happier. Heavens deal so still!
9946,"Let the superfluous and lust-dieted man,"
9947,"That slaves your ordinance, that will not see"
9948,"Because he does not feel, feel your power quickly;"
9949,"So distribution should undo excess,"
9950,And each man have enough. Dost thou know Dover?
9951,"There is a cliff, whose high and bending head"
9952,Looks fearfully in the confined deep:
9953,"Bring me but to the very brim of it,"
9954,And I’ll repair the misery thou dost bear
9955,With something rich about me: from that place
9956,I shall no leading need.
9957,Give me thy arm:
9958,Poor Tom shall lead thee.
9959,SCENE II. Before the Duke of Albany’s Palace
9960,"Welcome, my lord. I marvel our mild husband"
9961,"Not met us on the way. Now, where’s your master?"
9962,"Madam, within; but never man so chang’d."
9963,I told him of the army that was landed;
9964,He smil’d at it: I told him you were coming;
9965,"His answer was, ‘The worse.’ Of Gloucester’s treachery"
9966,And of the loyal service of his son
9967,"When I inform’d him, then he call’d me sot,"
9968,And told me I had turn’d the wrong side out.
9969,What most he should dislike seems pleasant to him;
9970,"It is the cowish terror of his spirit,"
9971,That dares not undertake. He’ll not feel wrongs
9972,Which tie him to an answer. Our wishes on the way
9973,"May prove effects. Back, Edmund, to my brother;"
9974,Hasten his musters and conduct his powers.
9975,"I must change names at home, and give the distaff"
9976,Into my husband’s hands. This trusty servant
9977,"Shall pass between us. Ere long you are like to hear,"
9978,"If you dare venture in your own behalf,"
9979,A mistress’s command. [_Giving a favour._]
9980,Wear this; spare speech;
9981,"Decline your head. This kiss, if it durst speak,"
9982,Would stretch thy spirits up into the air.
9983,"Conceive, and fare thee well."
9984,Yours in the ranks of death.
9985,My most dear Gloucester.
9986,"O, the difference of man and man!"
9987,To thee a woman’s services are due;
9988,My fool usurps my body.
9989,"Madam, here comes my lord."
9990,I have been worth the whistle.
9991,You are not worth the dust which the rude wind
9992,Blows in your face! I fear your disposition;
9993,That nature which contemns its origin
9994,Cannot be bordered certain in itself.
9995,She that herself will sliver and disbranch
9996,"From her material sap, perforce must wither"
9997,And come to deadly use.
9998,No more; the text is foolish.
9999,Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile;
10000,Filths savour but themselves. What have you done?
10001,"Tigers, not daughters, what have you perform’d?"
10002,"A father, and a gracious aged man,"
10003,"Whose reverence even the head-lugg’d bear would lick,"
10004,"Most barbarous, most degenerate, have you madded."
10005,Could my good brother suffer you to do it?
10006,"A man, a prince, by him so benefitted!"
10007,If that the heavens do not their visible spirits
10008,"Send quickly down to tame these vile offences,"
10009,"Humanity must perforce prey on itself,"
10010,Like monsters of the deep.
10011,"That bear’st a cheek for blows, a head for wrongs;"
10012,Who hast not in thy brows an eye discerning
10013,Thine honour from thy suffering; that not know’st
10014,Fools do those villains pity who are punish’d
10015,Ere they have done their mischief. Where’s thy drum?
10016,France spreads his banners in our noiseless land;
10017,"With plumed helm thy state begins to threat,"
10018,"Whilst thou, a moral fool, sitt’st still, and criest"
10019,"‘Alack, why does he so?’"
10020,Proper deformity seems not in the fiend
10021,So horrid as in woman.
10022,"Thou changed and self-cover’d thing, for shame!"
10023,Be-monster not thy feature! Were’t my fitness
10024,"To let these hands obey my blood,"
10025,They are apt enough to dislocate and tear
10026,"Thy flesh and bones. Howe’er thou art a fiend,"
10027,A woman’s shape doth shield thee.
10028,"Marry, your manhood, mew!"
10029,"O, my good lord, the Duke of Cornwall’s dead;"
10030,"Slain by his servant, going to put out"
10031,The other eye of Gloucester.
10032,"A servant that he bred, thrill’d with remorse,"
10033,"Oppos’d against the act, bending his sword"
10034,"To his great master; who, thereat enrag’d,"
10035,"Flew on him, and amongst them fell’d him dead;"
10036,But not without that harmful stroke which since
10037,Hath pluck’d him after.
10038,"This shows you are above,"
10039,"You justicers, that these our nether crimes"
10040,"So speedily can venge! But, O poor Gloucester!"
10041,Lost he his other eye?
10042,"Both, both, my lord."
10043,"This letter, madam, craves a speedy answer;"
10044,’Tis from your sister.
10045,"But being widow, and my Gloucester with her,"
10046,May all the building in my fancy pluck
10047,Upon my hateful life. Another way
10048,"The news is not so tart. I’ll read, and answer."
10049,Where was his son when they did take his eyes?
10050,Come with my lady hither.
10051,He is not here.
10052,"No, my good lord; I met him back again."
10053,Knows he the wickedness?
10054,"Ay, my good lord. ’Twas he inform’d against him;"
10055,"And quit the house on purpose, that their punishment"
10056,Might have the freer course.
10057,"To thank thee for the love thou show’dst the King,"
10058,"And to revenge thine eyes. Come hither, friend,"
10059,Tell me what more thou know’st.
10060,SCENE III. The French camp near Dover
10061,Enter Kent and a Gentleman.
10062,"Why the King of France is so suddenly gone back, know you no"
10063,"Something he left imperfect in the state, which since his coming"
10064,"forth is thought of, which imports to the kingdom so much fear"
10065,and danger that his personal return was most required and
10066,Who hath he left behind him general?
10067,"The Mareschal of France, Monsieur La Far."
10068,Did your letters pierce the queen to any demonstration of grief?
10069,"Ay, sir; she took them, read them in my presence;"
10070,And now and then an ample tear trill’d down
10071,Her delicate cheek. It seem’d she was a queen
10072,"Over her passion; who, most rebel-like,"
10073,Sought to be king o’er her.
10074,"O, then it mov’d her."
10075,Not to a rage: patience and sorrow strove
10076,Who should express her goodliest. You have seen
10077,Sunshine and rain at once: her smiles and tears
10078,Were like a better day. Those happy smilets
10079,That play’d on her ripe lip seem’d not to know
10080,What guests were in her eyes; which parted thence
10081,"As pearls from diamonds dropp’d. In brief,"
10082,"Sorrow would be a rarity most belov’d,"
10083,If all could so become it.
10084,Made she no verbal question?
10085,"Faith, once or twice she heav’d the name of ‘father’"
10086,"Pantingly forth, as if it press’d her heart;"
10087,"Cried ‘Sisters, sisters! Shame of ladies! sisters!"
10088,"Kent! father! sisters! What, i’ the storm? i’ the night?"
10089,Let pity not be believ’d!’ There she shook
10090,"The holy water from her heavenly eyes,"
10091,And clamour master’d her: then away she started
10092,To deal with grief alone.
10093,"It is the stars,"
10094,The stars above us govern our conditions;
10095,Else one self mate and make could not beget
10096,Such different issues. You spoke not with her since?
10097,Was this before the King return’d?
10098,"Well, sir, the poor distressed Lear’s i’ the town;"
10099,"Who sometime, in his better tune, remembers"
10100,"What we are come about, and by no means"
10101,Will yield to see his daughter.
10102,"A sovereign shame so elbows him. His own unkindness,"
10103,"That stripp’d her from his benediction, turn’d her"
10104,"To foreign casualties, gave her dear rights"
10105,"To his dog-hearted daughters, these things sting"
10106,His mind so venomously that burning shame
10107,Detains him from Cordelia.
10108,Of Albany’s and Cornwall’s powers you heard not?
10109,’Tis so; they are afoot.
10110,"Well, sir, I’ll bring you to our master Lear"
10111,And leave you to attend him. Some dear cause
10112,Will in concealment wrap me up awhile;
10113,"When I am known aright, you shall not grieve"
10114,Lending me this acquaintance.
10115,"I pray you, go along with me."
10116,SCENE IV. The French camp. A Tent
10117,"Enter with drum and colours, Cordelia, Physician"
10118,"Alack, ’tis he: why, he was met even now"
10119,As mad as the vex’d sea; singing aloud;
10120,"Crown’d with rank fumiter and furrow weeds,"
10121,"With harlocks, hemlock, nettles, cuckoo-flowers,"
10122,"Darnel, and all the idle weeds that grow"
10123,In our sustaining corn. A century send forth;
10124,"Search every acre in the high-grown field,"
10125,And bring him to our eye.
10126,What can man’s wisdom
10127,"In the restoring his bereaved sense,"
10128,He that helps him take all my outward worth.
10129,"There is means, madam:"
10130,"Our foster nurse of nature is repose,"
10131,The which he lacks; that to provoke in him
10132,"Are many simples operative, whose power"
10133,Will close the eye of anguish.
10134,"All you unpublish’d virtues of the earth,"
10135,Spring with my tears! Be aidant and remediate
10136,"In the good man’s distress! Seek, seek for him;"
10137,Lest his ungovern’d rage dissolve the life
10138,That wants the means to lead it.
10139,The British powers are marching hitherward.
10140,’Tis known before. Our preparation stands
10141,"In expectation of them. O dear father,"
10142,It is thy business that I go about;
10143,My mourning and important tears hath pitied.
10144,"No blown ambition doth our arms incite,"
10145,"But love, dear love, and our ag’d father’s right:"
10146,Soon may I hear and see him!
10147,SCENE V. A Room in Gloucester’s Castle
10148,Enter Regan and Oswald.
10149,But are my brother’s powers set forth?
10150,Himself in person there?
10151,"Madam, with much ado."
10152,Your sister is the better soldier.
10153,Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home?
10154,What might import my sister’s letter to him?
10155,"I know not, lady."
10156,"Faith, he is posted hence on serious matter."
10157,"It was great ignorance, Gloucester’s eyes being out,"
10158,To let him live. Where he arrives he moves
10159,"All hearts against us. Edmund, I think, is gone"
10160,"In pity of his misery, to dispatch"
10161,His nighted life; moreover to descry
10162,The strength o’ th’enemy.
10163,"I must needs after him, madam, with my letter."
10164,Our troops set forth tomorrow; stay with us;
10165,The ways are dangerous.
10166,"I may not, madam:"
10167,My lady charg’d my duty in this business.
10168,Why should she write to Edmund? Might not you
10169,"Transport her purposes by word? Belike,"
10170,"Somethings, I know not what, I’ll love thee much."
10171,Let me unseal the letter.
10172,"Madam, I had rather—"
10173,I know your lady does not love her husband;
10174,I am sure of that; and at her late being here
10175,She gave strange oeillades and most speaking looks
10176,To noble Edmund. I know you are of her bosom.
10177,"I speak in understanding; y’are, I know’t:"
10178,Therefore I do advise you take this note:
10179,"My lord is dead; Edmund and I have talk’d,"
10180,And more convenient is he for my hand
10181,Than for your lady’s. You may gather more.
10182,"If you do find him, pray you give him this;"
10183,"And when your mistress hears thus much from you,"
10184,I pray desire her call her wisdom to her.
10185,"So, fare you well."
10186,"If you do chance to hear of that blind traitor,"
10187,Preferment falls on him that cuts him off.
10188,"Would I could meet him, madam! I should show"
10189,What party I do follow.
10190,SCENE VI. The country near Dover
10191,"Enter Gloucester, and Edgar  dressed like a peasant."
10192,When shall I come to the top of that same hill?
10193,You do climb up it now. Look how we labour.
10194,Methinks the ground is even.
10195,"Hark, do you hear the sea?"
10196,"Why, then, your other senses grow imperfect"
10197,By your eyes’ anguish.
10198,So may it be indeed.
10199,Methinks thy voice is alter’d; and thou speak’st
10200,In better phrase and matter than thou didst.
10201,Y’are much deceiv’d: in nothing am I chang’d
10202,But in my garments.
10203,Methinks you’re better spoken.
10204,"Come on, sir; here’s the place. Stand still. How fearful"
10205,And dizzy ’tis to cast one’s eyes so low!
10206,The crows and choughs that wing the midway air
10207,Show scarce so gross as beetles. Half way down
10208,Hangs one that gathers samphire—dreadful trade!
10209,Methinks he seems no bigger than his head.
10210,The fishermen that walk upon the beach
10211,"Appear like mice; and yond tall anchoring bark,"
10212,Diminish’d to her cock; her cock a buoy
10213,Almost too small for sight: the murmuring surge
10214,That on th’unnumber’d idle pebble chafes
10215,Cannot be heard so high. I’ll look no more;
10216,"Lest my brain turn, and the deficient sight"
10217,Set me where you stand.
10218,Give me your hand.
10219,You are now within a foot of th’extreme verge.
10220,For all beneath the moon would I not leap upright.
10221,Let go my hand.
10222,"Here, friend, ’s another purse; in it a jewel"
10223,Well worth a poor man’s taking. Fairies and gods
10224,Prosper it with thee! Go thou further off;
10225,"Bid me farewell, and let me hear thee going."
10226,"Now fare ye well, good sir."
10227,With all my heart.
10228,Is done to cure it.
10229,O you mighty gods!
10230,"This world I do renounce, and in your sights,"
10231,Shake patiently my great affliction off:
10232,"If I could bear it longer, and not fall"
10233,"To quarrel with your great opposeless wills,"
10234,My snuff and loathed part of nature should
10235,"Burn itself out. If Edgar live, O, bless him!"
10236,"Now, fellow, fare thee well."
10237,And yet I know not how conceit may rob
10238,The treasury of life when life itself
10239,"Yields to the theft. Had he been where he thought,"
10240,By this had thought been past. Alive or dead?
10241,"Ho you, sir! friend! Hear you, sir? speak!"
10242,Thus might he pass indeed: yet he revives.
10243,"What are you, sir?"
10244,"Away, and let me die."
10245,"Hadst thou been aught but gossamer, feathers, air,"
10246,"So many fathom down precipitating,"
10247,Thou’dst shiver’d like an egg: but thou dost breathe;
10248,Hast heavy substance; bleed’st not; speak’st; art sound.
10249,Ten masts at each make not the altitude
10250,Which thou hast perpendicularly fell.
10251,Thy life is a miracle. Speak yet again.
10252,"But have I fall’n, or no?"
10253,From the dread summit of this chalky bourn.
10254,"Look up a-height, the shrill-gorg’d lark so far"
10255,Cannot be seen or heard. Do but look up.
10256,"Alack, I have no eyes."
10257,Is wretchedness depriv’d that benefit
10258,To end itself by death? ’Twas yet some comfort
10259,When misery could beguile the tyrant’s rage
10260,And frustrate his proud will.
10261,Give me your arm.
10262,"Up, so. How is’t? Feel you your legs? You stand."
10263,"Too well, too well."
10264,This is above all strangeness.
10265,Upon the crown o’ the cliff what thing was that
10266,Which parted from you?
10267,A poor unfortunate beggar.
10268,"As I stood here below, methought his eyes"
10269,"Were two full moons; he had a thousand noses,"
10270,Horns whelk’d and waved like the enraged sea.
10271,"It was some fiend. Therefore, thou happy father,"
10272,"Think that the clearest gods, who make them honours"
10273,"Of men’s impossibilities, have preserv’d thee."
10274,I do remember now: henceforth I’ll bear
10275,Affliction till it do cry out itself
10276,"‘Enough, enough,’ and die. That thing you speak of,"
10277,"I took it for a man; often ’twould say,"
10278,"‘The fiend, the fiend’; he led me to that place."
10279,Bear free and patient thoughts. But who comes here?
10280,dressed up with flowers.
10281,The safer sense will ne’er accommodate
10282,"No, they cannot touch me for coining. I am the King himself."
10283,O thou side-piercing sight!
10284,Nature’s above art in that respect. There’s your press money.
10285,That fellow handles his bow like a crow-keeper: draw me a clothier’s
10286,"yard. Look, look, a mouse! Peace, peace, this piece of toasted cheese"
10287,will do’t. There’s my gauntlet; I’ll prove it on a giant.
10288,"Bring up the brown bills. O, well flown, bird! i’ the clout, i’"
10289,the clout. Hewgh! Give the word.
10290,I know that voice.
10291,Ha! Goneril with a white beard! They flattered me like a dog; and told
10292,me I had white hairs in my beard ere the black ones were there. To say
10293,‘ay’ and ‘no’ to everything I said ‘ay’
10294,and ‘no’ to was no good divinity. When the rain came to wet
10295,"me once, and the wind to make me chatter; when the thunder would not"
10296,"peace at my bidding; there I found ’em, there I smelt ’em out."
10297,"Go to, they are not men o’ their words: they told me I was everything;"
10298,"’tis a lie, I am not ague-proof."
10299,The trick of that voice I do well remember:
10300,Is’t not the King?
10301,"Ay, every inch a king."
10302,"When I do stare, see how the subject quakes."
10303,I pardon that man’s life. What was thy cause?
10304,Adultery? Thou shalt not die: die for adultery! No:
10305,"The wren goes to’t, and the small gilded fly"
10306,Does lecher in my sight. Let copulation thrive;
10307,For Gloucester’s bastard son was kinder to his father
10308,Than my daughters got ’tween the lawful sheets.
10309,"To’t, luxury, pell-mell! for I lack soldiers."
10310,"Behold yond simp’ring dame,"
10311,Whose face between her forks presages snow;
10312,"That minces virtue, and does shake the head"
10313,To hear of pleasure’s name.
10314,The fitchew nor the soiled horse goes to’t with a more riotous
10315,"appetite. Down from the waist they are centaurs, though women all"
10316,"above. But to the girdle do the gods inherit, beneath is all the"
10317,"fiend’s; there’s hell, there’s darkness, there is the sulphurous pit;"
10318,"consumption. Fie, fie, fie! pah, pah! Give me an ounce of civet, good"
10319,"apothecary, to sweeten my imagination. There’s money for thee."
10320,"O, let me kiss that hand!"
10321,Let me wipe it first; it smells of mortality.
10322,"O ruin’d piece of nature, this great world"
10323,Shall so wear out to naught. Dost thou know me?
10324,I remember thine eyes well enough. Dost thou squiny at me?
10325,"No, do thy worst, blind Cupid; I’ll not love."
10326,Read thou this challenge; mark but the penning of it.
10327,"Were all the letters suns, I could not see one."
10328,"I would not take this from report,"
10329,"It is, and my heart breaks at it."
10330,"What, with the case of eyes?"
10331,"O, ho, are you there with me? No eyes in your head, nor no money"
10332,"in your purse? Your eyes are in a heavy case, your purse in a"
10333,"light, yet you see how this world goes."
10334,I see it feelingly.
10335,"What, art mad? A man may see how the world goes with no eyes."
10336,Look with thine ears. See how yon justice rails upon yon simple
10337,"thief. Hark, in thine ear: change places; and, handy-dandy, which"
10338,"is the justice, which is the thief? Thou hast seen a farmer’s"
10339,dog bark at a beggar?
10340,And the creature run from the cur? There thou mightst behold
10341,the great image of authority: a dog’s obeyed in office.
10342,"Thou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand!"
10343,Why dost thou lash that whore? Strip thine own back;
10344,Thou hotly lusts to use her in that kind
10345,For which thou whipp’st her. The usurer hangs the cozener.
10346,Through tatter’d clothes great vices do appear;
10347,"Robes and furr’d gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,"
10348,And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks;
10349,"Arm it in rags, a pygmy’s straw does pierce it."
10350,"None does offend, none, I say none; I’ll able ’em;"
10351,"Take that of me, my friend, who have the power"
10352,"To seal the accuser’s lips. Get thee glass eyes,"
10353,"And like a scurvy politician, seem"
10354,"To see the things thou dost not. Now, now, now, now:"
10355,"Pull off my boots: harder, harder, so."
10356,"O, matter and impertinency mix’d!"
10357,"If thou wilt weep my fortunes, take my eyes."
10358,"I know thee well enough, thy name is Gloucester."
10359,Thou must be patient; we came crying hither:
10360,Thou know’st the first time that we smell the air
10361,We wawl and cry. I will preach to thee: mark.
10362,"Alack, alack the day!"
10363,"When we are born, we cry that we are come"
10364,To this great stage of fools. This a good block:
10365,It were a delicate stratagem to shoe
10366,A troop of horse with felt. I’ll put’t in proof
10367,"And when I have stol’n upon these son-in-laws,"
10368,"Then kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!"
10369,Enter a Gentleman with
10370,"O, here he is: lay hand upon him. Sir,"
10371,Your most dear daughter—
10372,"No rescue? What, a prisoner? I am even"
10373,The natural fool of fortune. Use me well;
10374,You shall have ransom. Let me have surgeons;
10375,I am cut to the brains.
10376,You shall have anything.
10377,No seconds? All myself?
10378,"Why, this would make a man a man of salt,"
10379,"To use his eyes for garden water-pots,"
10380,"Ay, and for laying autumn’s dust."
10381,"I will die bravely, like a smug bridegroom."
10382,"What! I will be jovial. Come, come,"
10383,"I am a king, my masters, know you that."
10384,"You are a royal one, and we obey you."
10385,"Then there’s life in’t. Come, and you get it,"
10386,"You shall get it by running. Sa, sa, sa, sa!"
10387,"A sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch,"
10388,Past speaking of in a king! Thou hast one daughter
10389,Who redeems nature from the general curse
10390,Which twain have brought her to.
10391,"Sir, speed you. What’s your will?"
10392,"Do you hear aught, sir, of a battle toward?"
10393,Most sure and vulgar.
10394,"Everyone hears that, which can distinguish sound."
10395,"But, by your favour,"
10396,How near’s the other army?
10397,Near and on speedy foot; the main descry
10398,Stands on the hourly thought.
10399,"I thank you sir, that’s all."
10400,"Though that the queen on special cause is here,"
10401,Her army is mov’d on.
10402,"I thank you, sir."
10403,"You ever-gentle gods, take my breath from me;"
10404,Let not my worser spirit tempt me again
10405,To die before you please.
10406,"Well pray you, father."
10407,"Now, good sir, what are you?"
10408,"A most poor man, made tame to fortune’s blows;"
10409,"Who, by the art of known and feeling sorrows,"
10410,"Am pregnant to good pity. Give me your hand,"
10411,I’ll lead you to some biding.
10412,The bounty and the benison of heaven
10413,"To boot, and boot."
10414,A proclaim’d prize! Most happy!
10415,That eyeless head of thine was first fram’d flesh
10416,"To raise my fortunes. Thou old unhappy traitor,"
10417,Briefly thyself remember. The sword is out
10418,That must destroy thee.
10419,Now let thy friendly hand
10420,Put strength enough to’t.
10421,Dar’st thou support a publish’d traitor? Hence;
10422,Lest that th’infection of his fortune take
10423,Like hold on thee. Let go his arm.
10424,"Chill not let go, zir, without vurther ’casion."
10425,"Let go, slave, or thou diest!"
10426,"Good gentleman, go your gait, and let poor volke pass. An chud ha’"
10427,"bin zwaggered out of my life, ’twould not ha’ bin zo long"
10428,"as ’tis by a vortnight. Nay, come not near th’old man; keep"
10429,"out, che vor ye, or ise try whether your costard or my ballow be the"
10430,harder: chill be plain with you.
10431,"Chill pick your teeth, zir. Come! No matter vor your foins."
10432,"Slave, thou hast slain me. Villain, take my purse."
10433,"If ever thou wilt thrive, bury my body;"
10434,And give the letters which thou find’st about me
10435,"To Edmund, Earl of Gloucester. Seek him out"
10436,"Upon the British party. O, untimely death!"
10437,"I know thee well. A serviceable villain,"
10438,As duteous to the vices of thy mistress
10439,As badness would desire.
10440,"What, is he dead?"
10441,"Sit you down, father; rest you."
10442,Let’s see these pockets; the letters that he speaks of
10443,May be my friends. He’s dead; I am only sorry
10444,He had no other deathsman. Let us see:
10445,"Leave, gentle wax; and, manners, blame us not."
10446,"To know our enemies’ minds, we rip their hearts,"
10447,Their papers is more lawful.
10448,"opportunities to cut him off: if your will want not, time and place"
10449,will be fruitfully offered. There is nothing done if he return the
10450,"conqueror: then am I the prisoner, and his bed my gaol; from the"
10451,"loathed warmth whereof deliver me, and supply the place for your"
10452,"labour. ‘Your (wife, so I would say) affectionate servant, ‘Goneril.’"
10453,O indistinguish’d space of woman’s will!
10454,"A plot upon her virtuous husband’s life,"
10455,And the exchange my brother! Here in the sands
10456,"Thee I’ll rake up, the post unsanctified"
10457,"Of murderous lechers: and in the mature time,"
10458,With this ungracious paper strike the sight
10459,Of the death-practis’d Duke: for him ’tis well
10460,That of thy death and business I can tell.
10461,"The King is mad: how stiff is my vile sense,"
10462,"That I stand up, and have ingenious feeling"
10463,Of my huge sorrows! Better I were distract:
10464,"So should my thoughts be sever’d from my griefs,"
10465,And woes by wrong imaginations lose
10466,The knowledge of themselves.
10467,Give me your hand.
10468,Far off methinks I hear the beaten drum.
10469,"Come, father, I’ll bestow you with a friend."
10470,SCENE VII. A Tent in the French Camp
10471,"Lear on a bed, asleep, soft"
10472,"music playing; Physician, Gentleman and others"
10473,Enter Cordelia and Kent.
10474,"O thou good Kent, how shall I live and work"
10475,"To match thy goodness? My life will be too short,"
10476,And every measure fail me.
10477,"To be acknowledg’d, madam, is o’erpaid."
10478,All my reports go with the modest truth;
10479,"Nor more, nor clipp’d, but so."
10480,These weeds are memories of those worser hours:
10481,I prithee put them off.
10482,Yet to be known shortens my made intent.
10483,My boon I make it that you know me not
10484,Till time and I think meet.
10485,"Then be’t so, my good lord. [_To the Physician._] How does the King?"
10486,"O you kind gods,"
10487,Cure this great breach in his abused nature!
10488,"The untun’d and jarring senses, O, wind up"
10489,Of this child-changed father.
10490,So please your majesty
10491,That we may wake the King: he hath slept long.
10492,"Be govern’d by your knowledge, and proceed"
10493,I’ the sway of your own will. Is he array’d?
10494,"Ay, madam. In the heaviness of sleep"
10495,We put fresh garments on him.
10496,"Be by, good madam, when we do awake him;"
10497,I doubt not of his temperance.
10498,Please you draw near. Louder the music there!
10499,O my dear father! Restoration hang
10500,Thy medicine on my lips; and let this kiss
10501,Repair those violent harms that my two sisters
10502,Have in thy reverence made!
10503,Kind and dear princess!
10504,"Had you not been their father, these white flakes"
10505,Did challenge pity of them. Was this a face
10506,To be oppos’d against the warring winds?
10507,To stand against the deep dread-bolted thunder?
10508,In the most terrible and nimble stroke
10509,"Of quick cross lightning? to watch, poor perdu!"
10510,"With this thin helm? Mine enemy’s dog,"
10511,"Though he had bit me, should have stood that night"
10512,"Against my fire; and wast thou fain, poor father,"
10513,To hovel thee with swine and rogues forlorn
10514,"In short and musty straw? Alack, alack!"
10515,’Tis wonder that thy life and wits at once
10516,Had not concluded all. He wakes; speak to him.
10517,"Madam, do you; ’tis fittest."
10518,How does my royal lord? How fares your majesty?
10519,You do me wrong to take me out o’ the grave.
10520,Thou art a soul in bliss; but I am bound
10521,"Upon a wheel of fire, that mine own tears"
10522,Do scald like molten lead.
10523,"Sir, do you know me?"
10524,"You are a spirit, I know: when did you die?"
10525,"Still, still, far wide!"
10526,He’s scarce awake: let him alone awhile.
10527,Where have I been? Where am I? Fair daylight?
10528,"I am mightily abus’d. I should e’en die with pity,"
10529,To see another thus. I know not what to say.
10530,I will not swear these are my hands: let’s see;
10531,I feel this pin prick. Would I were assur’d
10532,"O, look upon me, sir,"
10533,And hold your hands in benediction o’er me.
10534,"No, sir, you must not kneel."
10535,"Pray, do not mock me:"
10536,"I am a very foolish fond old man,"
10537,"Fourscore and upward, not an hour more nor less;"
10538,"And to deal plainly,"
10539,I fear I am not in my perfect mind.
10540,"Methinks I should know you, and know this man;"
10541,Yet I am doubtful: for I am mainly ignorant
10542,What place this is; and all the skill I have
10543,Remembers not these garments; nor I know not
10544,Where I did lodge last night. Do not laugh at me;
10545,"For, as I am a man, I think this lady"
10546,To be my child Cordelia.
10547,And so I am. I am.
10548,"Be your tears wet? Yes, faith. I pray weep not:"
10549,"If you have poison for me, I will drink it."
10550,I know you do not love me; for your sisters
10551,"Have, as I do remember, done me wrong."
10552,"You have some cause, they have not."
10553,"No cause, no cause."
10554,Am I in France?
10555,"In your own kingdom, sir."
10556,Do not abuse me.
10557,"Be comforted, good madam, the great rage,"
10558,"You see, is kill’d in him: and yet it is danger"
10559,To make him even o’er the time he has lost.
10560,Desire him to go in; trouble him no more
10561,Will’t please your highness walk?
10562,You must bear with me:
10563,"Pray you now, forget and forgive: I am old and foolish."
10564,"Holds it true, sir, that the Duke of Cornwall was so slain?"
10565,Who is conductor of his people?
10566,"As ’tis said, the bastard son of Gloucester."
10567,"They say Edgar, his banished son, is with the Earl of Kent"
10568,Report is changeable. ’Tis time to look about; the powers of
10569,the kingdom approach apace.
10570,The arbitrement is like to be bloody.
10571,"Fare you well, sir."
10572,"My point and period will be throughly wrought,"
10573,"Or well or ill, as this day’s battle’s fought."
10574,SCENE I. The Camp of the British Forces near Dover
10575,"Enter, with drum and colours Edmund, Regan, Officers, Soldiers and"
10576,"Know of the Duke if his last purpose hold,"
10577,Or whether since he is advis’d by aught
10578,"To change the course, he’s full of alteration"
10579,"And self-reproving, bring his constant pleasure."
10580,Our sister’s man is certainly miscarried.
10581,"’Tis to be doubted, madam."
10582,You know the goodness I intend upon you:
10583,"Tell me but truly, but then speak the truth,"
10584,Do you not love my sister?
10585,But have you never found my brother’s way
10586,To the forfended place?
10587,That thought abuses you.
10588,I am doubtful that you have been conjunct
10589,"And bosom’d with her, as far as we call hers."
10590,"No, by mine honour, madam."
10591,"I never shall endure her, dear my lord,"
10592,Be not familiar with her.
10593,She and the Duke her husband!
10594,"Enter with drum and colours Albany, Goneril and Soldiers."
10595,Should loosen him and me.
10596,"Our very loving sister, well be-met."
10597,"Sir, this I heard: the King is come to his daughter,"
10598,With others whom the rigour of our state
10599,"Forc’d to cry out. Where I could not be honest,"
10600,"I never yet was valiant. For this business,"
10601,"It toucheth us as France invades our land,"
10602,"Not bolds the King, with others whom I fear"
10603,Most just and heavy causes make oppose.
10604,"Sir, you speak nobly."
10605,Why is this reason’d?
10606,Combine together ’gainst the enemy;
10607,For these domestic and particular broils
10608,Are not the question here.
10609,"Let’s, then, determine with the ancient of war"
10610,I shall attend you presently at your tent.
10611,"Sister, you’ll go with us?"
10612,"’Tis most convenient; pray you, go with us."
10613,"As they are going out, enter Edgar disguised."
10614,"If e’er your grace had speech with man so poor,"
10615,Hear me one word.
10616,I’ll overtake you. Speak.
10617,"Before you fight the battle, ope this letter."
10618,"If you have victory, let the trumpet sound"
10619,"For him that brought it: wretched though I seem,"
10620,I can produce a champion that will prove
10621,"What is avouched there. If you miscarry,"
10622,"Your business of the world hath so an end,"
10623,And machination ceases. Fortune love you!
10624,Stay till I have read the letter.
10625,I was forbid it.
10626,"When time shall serve, let but the herald cry,"
10627,And I’ll appear again.
10628,"Why, fare thee well. I will o’erlook thy paper."
10629,The enemy’s in view; draw up your powers.
10630,Here is the guess of their true strength and forces
10631,By diligent discovery; but your haste
10632,Is now urg’d on you.
10633,We will greet the time.
10634,To both these sisters have I sworn my love;
10635,"Each jealous of the other, as the stung"
10636,Are of the adder. Which of them shall I take?
10637,"Both? One? Or neither? Neither can be enjoy’d,"
10638,If both remain alive. To take the widow
10639,"Exasperates, makes mad her sister Goneril;"
10640,"And hardly shall I carry out my side,"
10641,"Her husband being alive. Now, then, we’ll use"
10642,"His countenance for the battle; which being done,"
10643,Let her who would be rid of him devise
10644,His speedy taking off. As for the mercy
10645,"Which he intends to Lear and to Cordelia,"
10646,"The battle done, and they within our power,"
10647,Shall never see his pardon: for my state
10648,"Stands on me to defend, not to debate."
10649,SCENE II. A field between the two Camps
10650,"Alarum within. Enter with drum and colours, Lear, Cordelia and their"
10651,Enter Edgar and Gloucester.
10652,"Here, father, take the shadow of this tree"
10653,For your good host; pray that the right may thrive:
10654,"If ever I return to you again,"
10655,I’ll bring you comfort.
10656,"Grace go with you, sir!"
10657,Alarum and retreat within. Enter Edgar.
10658,"Away, old man, give me thy hand, away!"
10659,"King Lear hath lost, he and his daughter ta’en:"
10660,Give me thy hand; come on!
10661,"No further, sir; a man may rot even here."
10662,"What, in ill thoughts again? Men must endure"
10663,"Their going hence, even as their coming hither;"
10664,Ripeness is all. Come on.
10665,And that’s true too.
10666,SCENE III. The British Camp near Dover
10667,"Enter in conquest with drum and colours, Edmund, Lear and Cordelia"
10668,"as prisoners; Officers, Soldiers, &c."
10669,Some officers take them away: good guard
10670,Until their greater pleasures first be known
10671,That are to censure them.
10672,We are not the first
10673,Who with best meaning have incurr’d the worst.
10674,"For thee, oppressed King, I am cast down;"
10675,Myself could else out-frown false fortune’s frown.
10676,Shall we not see these daughters and these sisters?
10677,"No, no, no, no. Come, let’s away to prison:"
10678,We two alone will sing like birds i’ the cage:
10679,When thou dost ask me blessing I’ll kneel down
10680,"And ask of thee forgiveness. So we’ll live,"
10681,"And pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laugh"
10682,"At gilded butterflies, and hear poor rogues"
10683,"Talk of court news; and we’ll talk with them too,"
10684,"Who loses and who wins; who’s in, who’s out;"
10685,"And take upon’s the mystery of things,"
10686,"As if we were God’s spies. And we’ll wear out,"
10687,"In a wall’d prison, packs and sects of great ones"
10688,That ebb and flow by the moon.
10689,"Upon such sacrifices, my Cordelia,"
10690,The gods themselves throw incense. Have I caught thee?
10691,"He that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven,"
10692,And fire us hence like foxes. Wipe thine eyes;
10693,"The good years shall devour them, flesh and fell,"
10694,Ere they shall make us weep!
10695,We’ll see ’em starve first: come.
10696,"Come hither, captain, hark."
10697,Take thou this note [_giving a paper_]; go follow them to prison.
10698,One step I have advanc’d thee; if thou dost
10699,"As this instructs thee, thou dost make thy way"
10700,"To noble fortunes: know thou this, that men"
10701,Are as the time is; to be tender-minded
10702,Does not become a sword. Thy great employment
10703,"Will not bear question; either say thou’lt do’t,"
10704,Or thrive by other means.
10705,"I’ll do’t, my lord."
10706,About it; and write happy when thou hast done.
10707,"Mark, I say, instantly; and carry it so"
10708,As I have set it down.
10709,"I cannot draw a cart, nor eat dried oats;"
10710,"If it be man’s work, I’ll do’t."
10711,"Flourish. Enter Albany, Goneril,"
10712,"Regan, Officers and Attendants."
10713,"Sir, you have show’d today your valiant strain,"
10714,And fortune led you well: you have the captives
10715,Who were the opposites of this day’s strife:
10716,"I do require them of you, so to use them"
10717,As we shall find their merits and our safety
10718,"Sir, I thought it fit"
10719,To send the old and miserable King
10720,To some retention and appointed guard;
10721,"Whose age has charms in it, whose title more,"
10722,"To pluck the common bosom on his side,"
10723,And turn our impress’d lances in our eyes
10724,Which do command them. With him I sent the queen;
10725,My reason all the same; and they are ready
10726,"Tomorrow, or at further space, to appear"
10727,Where you shall hold your session. At this time
10728,We sweat and bleed: the friend hath lost his friend;
10729,And the best quarrels in the heat are curs’d
10730,By those that feel their sharpness.
10731,The question of Cordelia and her father
10732,Requires a fitter place.
10733,"Sir, by your patience,"
10734,"I hold you but a subject of this war,"
10735,Not as a brother.
10736,That’s as we list to grace him.
10737,Methinks our pleasure might have been demanded
10738,Ere you had spoke so far. He led our powers;
10739,Bore the commission of my place and person;
10740,The which immediacy may well stand up
10741,And call itself your brother.
10742,"In his own grace he doth exalt himself,"
10743,More than in your addition.
10744,"By me invested, he compeers the best."
10745,"That were the most, if he should husband you."
10746,Jesters do oft prove prophets.
10747,That eye that told you so look’d but asquint.
10748,"Lady, I am not well; else I should answer"
10749,"From a full-flowing stomach. General,"
10750,"Take thou my soldiers, prisoners, patrimony;"
10751,"Dispose of them, of me; the walls are thine:"
10752,Witness the world that I create thee here
10753,My lord and master.
10754,Mean you to enjoy him?
10755,The let-alone lies not in your good will.
10756,"Nor in thine, lord."
10757,"Stay yet; hear reason: Edmund, I arrest thee"
10758,"On capital treason; and, in thine arrest,"
10759,This gilded serpent. [_pointing to Goneril._]
10760,"For your claim, fair sister,"
10761,I bar it in the interest of my wife;
10762,"’Tis she is sub-contracted to this lord,"
10763,And I her husband contradict your bans.
10764,"If you will marry, make your loves to me,"
10765,My lady is bespoke.
10766,"Thou art arm’d, Gloucester. Let the trumpet sound:"
10767,If none appear to prove upon thy person
10768,"Thy heinous, manifest, and many treasons,"
10769,There is my pledge. [_Throwing down a glove._]
10770,"I’ll make it on thy heart,"
10771,"Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less"
10772,Than I have here proclaim’d thee.
10773,There’s my exchange. [_Throwing down a glove._]
10774,What in the world he is
10775,"That names me traitor, villain-like he lies."
10776,"Call by thy trumpet: he that dares approach,"
10777,"On him, on you, who not? I will maintain"
10778,My truth and honour firmly.
10779,"Trust to thy single virtue; for thy soldiers,"
10780,"All levied in my name, have in my name"
10781,My sickness grows upon me.
10782,She is not well. Convey her to my tent.
10783,"Come hither, herald. Let the trumpet sound"
10784,And read out this.
10785,"the army will maintain upon Edmund, supposed Earl of Gloucester,"
10786,"that he is a manifold traitor, let him appear by the third sound"
10787,of the trumpet. He is bold in his defence.’
10788,"Third trumpet. Trumpet answers within. Enter Edgar, armed, preceded by"
10789,"Ask him his purposes, why he appears"
10790,Upon this call o’ the trumpet.
10791,"Your name, your quality? and why you answer"
10792,Know my name is lost;
10793,By treason’s tooth bare-gnawn and canker-bit.
10794,Yet am I noble as the adversary
10795,I come to cope.
10796,Which is that adversary?
10797,"What’s he that speaks for Edmund, Earl of Gloucester?"
10798,"Himself, what say’st thou to him?"
10799,"That if my speech offend a noble heart,"
10800,Thy arm may do thee justice: here is mine.
10801,"Behold, it is the privilege of mine honours,"
10802,"My oath, and my profession: I protest,"
10803,"Maugre thy strength, youth, place, and eminence,"
10804,"Despite thy victor sword and fire-new fortune,"
10805,"Thy valour and thy heart, thou art a traitor;"
10806,"False to thy gods, thy brother, and thy father;"
10807,Conspirant ’gainst this high illustrious prince;
10808,"And, from the extremest upward of thy head"
10809,"To the descent and dust beneath thy foot,"
10810,"A most toad-spotted traitor. Say thou ‘No,’"
10811,"This sword, this arm, and my best spirits are bent"
10812,"To prove upon thy heart, whereto I speak,"
10813,In wisdom I should ask thy name;
10814,"But since thy outside looks so fair and warlike,"
10815,"And that thy tongue some say of breeding breathes,"
10816,What safe and nicely I might well delay
10817,"By rule of knighthood, I disdain and spurn."
10818,"Back do I toss those treasons to thy head,"
10819,With the hell-hated lie o’erwhelm thy heart;
10820,"Which for they yet glance by and scarcely bruise,"
10821,"This sword of mine shall give them instant way,"
10822,"Where they shall rest for ever. Trumpets, speak!"
10823,"Save him, save him!"
10824,"This is mere practice, Gloucester:"
10825,By the law of arms thou wast not bound to answer
10826,"An unknown opposite; thou art not vanquish’d,"
10827,But cozen’d and beguil’d.
10828,"Shut your mouth, dame,"
10829,"Or with this paper shall I stop it. Hold, sir;"
10830,"Thou worse than any name, read thine own evil."
10831,"No tearing, lady; I perceive you know it."
10832,"Say if I do, the laws are mine, not thine:"
10833,Who can arraign me for’t?
10834,Know’st thou this paper?
10835,Ask me not what I know.
10836,"What you have charg’d me with, that have I done;"
10837,"And more, much more; the time will bring it out."
10838,"’Tis past, and so am I. But what art thou"
10839,"That hast this fortune on me? If thou’rt noble,"
10840,I do forgive thee.
10841,"I am no less in blood than thou art, Edmund;"
10842,"If more, the more thou hast wrong’d me."
10843,My name is Edgar and thy father’s son.
10844,"The gods are just, and of our pleasant vices"
10845,Make instruments to plague us:
10846,The dark and vicious place where thee he got
10847,Cost him his eyes.
10848,"Thou hast spoken right, ’tis true;"
10849,The wheel is come full circle; I am here.
10850,Methought thy very gait did prophesy
10851,A royal nobleness. I must embrace thee.
10852,Let sorrow split my heart if ever I
10853,Did hate thee or thy father.
10854,"Worthy prince, I know’t."
10855,Where have you hid yourself?
10856,How have you known the miseries of your father?
10857,"By nursing them, my lord. List a brief tale;"
10858,"And when ’tis told, O that my heart would burst!"
10859,The bloody proclamation to escape
10860,"That follow’d me so near,—O, our lives’ sweetness!"
10861,That with the pain of death we’d hourly die
10862,Rather than die at once!—taught me to shift
10863,Into a madman’s rags; t’assume a semblance
10864,That very dogs disdain’d; and in this habit
10865,"Met I my father with his bleeding rings,"
10866,"Their precious stones new lost; became his guide,"
10867,"Led him, begg’d for him, sav’d him from despair;"
10868,"Never,—O fault!—reveal’d myself unto him"
10869,"Until some half hour past, when I was arm’d;"
10870,"Not sure, though hoping of this good success,"
10871,"I ask’d his blessing, and from first to last"
10872,"Told him my pilgrimage. But his flaw’d heart,"
10873,"Alack, too weak the conflict to support!"
10874,"’Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief,"
10875,"This speech of yours hath mov’d me,"
10876,"And shall perchance do good, but speak you on;"
10877,You look as you had something more to say.
10878,"If there be more, more woeful, hold it in;"
10879,"For I am almost ready to dissolve,"
10880,This would have seem’d a period
10881,"To such as love not sorrow; but another,"
10882,"To amplify too much, would make much more,"
10883,"Whilst I was big in clamour, came there a man"
10884,"Who, having seen me in my worst estate,"
10885,Shunn’d my abhorr’d society; but then finding
10886,"Who ’twas that so endur’d, with his strong arms"
10887,"He fastened on my neck, and bellow’d out"
10888,As he’d burst heaven; threw him on my father;
10889,Told the most piteous tale of Lear and him
10890,"That ever ear receiv’d, which in recounting"
10891,"His grief grew puissant, and the strings of life"
10892,"Began to crack. Twice then the trumpets sounded,"
10893,And there I left him tranc’d.
10894,But who was this?
10895,"Kent, sir, the banish’d Kent; who in disguise"
10896,Follow’d his enemy king and did him service
10897,Improper for a slave.
10898,"Enter a Gentleman hastily,"
10899,with a bloody knife.
10900,"Help, help! O, help!"
10901,What kind of help?
10902,What means this bloody knife?
10903,"’Tis hot, it smokes;"
10904,It came even from the heart of—O! she’s dead!
10905,"Who dead? Speak, man."
10906,"Your lady, sir, your lady; and her sister"
10907,By her is poisoned; she hath confesses it.
10908,"I was contracted to them both, all three"
10909,Now marry in an instant.
10910,"Produce their bodies, be they alive or dead."
10911,This judgement of the heavens that makes us tremble
10912,"Touches us not with pity. O, is this he?"
10913,The time will not allow the compliment
10914,Which very manners urges.
10915,To bid my King and master aye good night:
10916,Is he not here?
10917,Great thing of us forgot!
10918,"Speak, Edmund, where’s the King? and where’s Cordelia?"
10919,The bodies of Goneril and
10920,Regan are brought in.
10921,"Seest thou this object, Kent?"
10922,Yet Edmund was belov’d.
10923,"The one the other poisoned for my sake,"
10924,And after slew herself.
10925,Even so. Cover their faces.
10926,"I pant for life. Some good I mean to do,"
10927,"Despite of mine own nature. Quickly send,"
10928,"Be brief in it, to the castle; for my writ"
10929,Is on the life of Lear and on Cordelia;
10930,"Nay, send in time."
10931,"Run, run, O, run!"
10932,"To who, my lord? Who has the office? Send"
10933,Thy token of reprieve.
10934,"Well thought on: take my sword,"
10935,Give it the captain.
10936,Haste thee for thy life.
10937,He hath commission from thy wife and me
10938,"To hang Cordelia in the prison, and"
10939,"To lay the blame upon her own despair,"
10940,That she fordid herself.
10941,The gods defend her! Bear him hence awhile.
10942,"Enter Lear with Cordelia dead in his arms; Edgar,"
10943,Officer and others following.
10944,"Howl, howl, howl, howl! O, you are men of stone."
10945,"Had I your tongues and eyes, I’ld use them so"
10946,That heaven’s vault should crack. She’s gone for ever!
10947,"I know when one is dead, and when one lives;"
10948,She’s dead as earth. Lend me a looking glass;
10949,"If that her breath will mist or stain the stone,"
10950,"Why, then she lives."
10951,Is this the promis’d end?
10952,Or image of that horror?
10953,"This feather stirs; she lives! If it be so,"
10954,It is a chance which does redeem all sorrows
10955,That ever I have felt.
10956,"O, my good master! [_Kneeling._]"
10957,"’Tis noble Kent, your friend."
10958,"A plague upon you, murderers, traitors all!"
10959,I might have sav’d her; now she’s gone for ever!
10960,"Cordelia, Cordelia! stay a little. Ha!"
10961,"What is’t thou say’st? Her voice was ever soft,"
10962,"Gentle, and low, an excellent thing in woman."
10963,I kill’d the slave that was a-hanging thee.
10964,"’Tis true, my lords, he did."
10965,"Did I not, fellow?"
10966,"I have seen the day, with my good biting falchion"
10967,"I would have made them skip. I am old now,"
10968,And these same crosses spoil me. Who are you?
10969,"Mine eyes are not o’ the best, I’ll tell you straight."
10970,"If Fortune brag of two she lov’d and hated,"
10971,One of them we behold.
10972,This is a dull sight. Are you not Kent?
10973,Your servant Kent. Where is your servant Caius?
10974,"He’s a good fellow, I can tell you that;"
10975,"He’ll strike, and quickly too:. He’s dead and rotten."
10976,"No, my good lord; I am the very man."
10977,I’ll see that straight.
10978,That from your first of difference and decay
10979,Have follow’d your sad steps.
10980,You are welcome hither.
10981,"Nor no man else. All’s cheerless, dark and deadly."
10982,"Your eldest daughters have fordone themselves,"
10983,And desperately are dead.
10984,"Ay, so I think."
10985,He knows not what he says; and vain is it
10986,That we present us to him.
10987,"Edmund is dead, my lord."
10988,That’s but a trifle here.
10989,"You lords and noble friends, know our intent."
10990,What comfort to this great decay may come
10991,"Shall be applied. For us, we will resign,"
10992,"During the life of this old majesty,"
10993,To him our absolute power;
10994,With boot and such addition as your honours
10995,Have more than merited. All friends shall taste
10996,The wages of their virtue and all foes
10997,"The cup of their deservings. O, see, see!"
10998,"And my poor fool is hang’d! No, no, no life!"
10999,"Why should a dog, a horse, a rat have life,"
11000,"And thou no breath at all? Thou’lt come no more,"
11001,"Never, never, never, never, never!"
11002,"Pray you undo this button. Thank you, sir."
11003,"Do you see this? Look on her: look, her lips,"
11004,"Look there, look there!"
11005,"He faints! My lord, my lord!"
11006,"Break, heart; I prithee break!"
11007,"Look up, my lord."
11008,"Vex not his ghost: O, let him pass! He hates him"
11009,That would upon the rack of this rough world
11010,Stretch him out longer.
11011,He is gone indeed.
11012,"The wonder is, he hath endur’d so long:"
11013,He but usurp’d his life.
11014,Bear them from hence. Our present business
11015,"Is general woe. [_To Edgar and Kent._] Friends of my soul, you twain,"
11016,Rule in this realm and the gor’d state sustain.
11017,"I have a journey, sir, shortly to go;"
11018,"My master calls me, I must not say no."
11019,The weight of this sad time we must obey;
11020,"Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say."
11021,The oldest hath borne most; we that are young
11022,"Shall never see so much, nor live so long."

11054,"That honour which shall bate his scythe’s keen edge,"
11055,And make us heirs of all eternity.
11056,"Therefore, brave conquerors, for so you are"
11057,That war against your own affections
11058,"And the huge army of the world’s desires,"
11059,Our late edict shall strongly stand in force.
11060,Navarre shall be the wonder of the world;
11061,"Our court shall be a little academe,"
11062,Still and contemplative in living art.
11063,"You three, Berowne, Dumaine and Longaville,"
11064,"Have sworn for three years’ term to live with me,"
11065,"My fellow-scholars, and to keep those statutes"
11066,That are recorded in this schedule here.
11067,"Your oaths are passed, and now subscribe your names,"
11068,That his own hand may strike his honour down
11069,That violates the smallest branch herein.
11070,"If you are armed to do as sworn to do,"
11071,"Subscribe to your deep oaths, and keep it too."
11072,I am resolved. ’Tis but a three years’ fast.
11073,"The mind shall banquet, though the body pine."
11074,"Fat paunches have lean pates, and dainty bits"
11075,"Make rich the ribs, but bankrupt quite the wits."
11076,"My loving lord, Dumaine is mortified."
11077,The grosser manner of these world’s delights
11078,He throws upon the gross world’s baser slaves.
11079,"To love, to wealth, to pomp, I pine and die,"
11080,With all these living in philosophy.
11081,I can but say their protestation over.
11082,"So much, dear liege, I have already sworn,"
11083,"That is, to live and study here three years."
11084,But there are other strict observances:
11085,"As not to see a woman in that term,"
11086,Which I hope well is not enrolled there;
11087,"And one day in a week to touch no food,"
11088,"And but one meal on every day beside,"
11089,The which I hope is not enrolled there;
11090,"And then to sleep but three hours in the night,"
11091,"And not be seen to wink of all the day,"
11092,"When I was wont to think no harm all night,"
11093,"And make a dark night too of half the day,"
11094,Which I hope well is not enrolled there.
11095,"O, these are barren tasks, too hard to keep,"
11096,"Not to see ladies, study, fast, not sleep."
11097,Your oath is passed to pass away from these.
11098,"Let me say no, my liege, an if you please."
11099,I only swore to study with your Grace
11100,And stay here in your court for three years’ space.
11101,"You swore to that, Berowne, and to the rest."
11102,"By yea and nay, sir, then I swore in jest."
11103,"What is the end of study, let me know?"
11104,"Why, that to know which else we should not know."
11105,"Things hid and barred, you mean, from common sense?"
11106,"Ay, that is study’s god-like recompense."
11107,"Come on, then, I will swear to study so,"
11108,To know the thing I am forbid to know:
11109,"As thus, to study where I well may dine,"
11110,When I to feast expressly am forbid;
11111,"Or study where to meet some mistress fine,"
11112,When mistresses from common sense are hid;
11113,"Or, having sworn too hard-a-keeping oath,"
11114,"Study to break it, and not break my troth."
11115,"If study’s gain be thus, and this be so,"
11116,Study knows that which yet it doth not know.
11117,"Swear me to this, and I will ne’er say no."
11118,"These be the stops that hinder study quite,"
11119,And train our intellects to vain delight.
11120,"Why, all delights are vain, but that most vain"
11121,"Which, with pain purchased, doth inherit pain:"
11122,As painfully to pore upon a book
11123,"To seek the light of truth, while truth the while"
11124,Doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look.
11125,Light seeking light doth light of light beguile;
11126,"So, ere you find where light in darkness lies,"
11127,Your light grows dark by losing of your eyes.
11128,Study me how to please the eye indeed
11129,"By fixing it upon a fairer eye,"
11130,"Who dazzling so, that eye shall be his heed,"
11131,And give him light that it was blinded by.
11132,"Study is like the heaven’s glorious sun,"
11133,That will not be deep-searched with saucy looks;
11134,"Small have continual plodders ever won,"
11135,Save base authority from others’ books.
11136,"These earthly godfathers of heaven’s lights,"
11137,"That give a name to every fixed star,"
11138,Have no more profit of their shining nights
11139,Than those that walk and wot not what they are.
11140,"Too much to know is to know naught but fame,"
11141,And every godfather can give a name.
11142,"How well he’s read, to reason against reading."
11143,"Proceeded well, to stop all good proceeding."
11144,"He weeds the corn, and still lets grow the weeding."
11145,The spring is near when green geese are a-breeding.
11146,Fit in his place and time.
11147,Something then in rhyme.
11148,Berowne is like an envious sneaping frost
11149,That bites the first-born infants of the spring.
11150,"Well, say I am. Why should proud summer boast"
11151,Before the birds have any cause to sing?
11152,Why should I joy in any abortive birth?
11153,At Christmas I no more desire a rose
11154,"Than wish a snow in May’s new-fangled shows,"
11155,But like of each thing that in season grows.
11156,"So you, to study now it is too late,"
11157,Climb o’er the house to unlock the little gate.
11158,"Well, sit you out. Go home, Berowne. Adieu."
11159,"No, my good lord, I have sworn to stay with you,"
11160,And though I have for barbarism spoke more
11161,"Than for that angel knowledge you can say,"
11162,Yet confident I’ll keep what I have sworn
11163,And bide the penance of each three years’ day.
11164,"Give me the paper, let me read the same,"
11165,And to the strictest decrees I’ll write my name.
11166,How well this yielding rescues thee from shame.
11167,Hath this been proclaimed?
11168,Let’s see the penalty. [_Reads_.] _On pain of losing her tongue._ Who
11169,"Marry, that did I."
11170,"Sweet lord, and why?"
11171,To fright them hence with that dread penalty.
11172,A dangerous law against gentility.
11173,"term of three years, he shall endure such public shame as the rest of"
11174,the court can possibly devise._
11175,"This article, my liege, yourself must break,"
11176,For well you know here comes in embassy
11177,"The French King’s daughter, with yourself to speak—"
11178,A mild of grace and complete majesty—
11179,About surrender up of Aquitaine
11180,"To her decrepit, sick, and bedrid father."
11181,"Therefore this article is made in vain,"
11182,Or vainly comes th’ admired Princess hither.
11183,"What say you, lords? Why, this was quite forgot."
11184,So study evermore is overshot.
11185,"While it doth study to have what it would,"
11186,It doth forget to do the thing it should;
11187,"And when it hath the thing it hunteth most,"
11188,"’Tis won as towns with fire: so won, so lost."
11189,We must of force dispense with this decree.
11190,She must lie here on mere necessity.
11191,Necessity will make us all forsworn
11192,Three thousand times within this three years’ space;
11193,"For every man with his affects is born,"
11194,"Not by might mastered, but by special grace."
11195,"If I break faith, this word shall speak for me:"
11196,I am forsworn on mere necessity.
11197,"So to the laws at large I write my name,"
11198,And he that breaks them in the least degree
11199,Stands in attainder of eternal shame.
11200,Suggestions are to other as to me;
11201,"But I believe, although I seem so loath,"
11202,I am the last that will last keep his oath.
11203,But is there no quick recreation granted?
11204,"Ay, that there is. Our court, you know, is haunted"
11205,"With a refined traveller of Spain,"
11206,"A man in all the world’s new fashion planted,"
11207,That hath a mint of phrases in his brain;
11208,One who the music of his own vain tongue
11209,"Doth ravish like enchanting harmony,"
11210,"A man of complements, whom right and wrong"
11211,Have chose as umpire of their mutiny.
11212,"This child of fancy, that Armado hight,"
11213,For interim to our studies shall relate
11214,In high-born words the worth of many a knight
11215,From tawny Spain lost in the world’s debate.
11216,"How you delight, my lords, I know not, I,"
11217,"But I protest I love to hear him lie,"
11218,And I will use him for my minstrelsy.
11219,"Armado is a most illustrious wight,"
11220,"A man of fire-new words, fashion’s own knight."
11221,"Costard the swain and he shall be our sport,"
11222,And so to study three years is but short.
11223,"Enter Dull, a Constable, with a letter, and Costard."
11224,Which is the Duke’s own person?
11225,"This, fellow. What wouldst?"
11226,"I myself reprehend his own person, for I am his Grace’s farborough. But"
11227,I would see his own person in flesh and blood.
11228,Signior Arm… Arm… commends you. There’s villainy abroad. This letter
11229,will tell you more.
11230,"Sir, the contempts thereof are as touching me."
11231,A letter from the magnificent Armado.
11232,"How long soever the matter, I hope in God for high words."
11233,A high hope for a low heaven. God grant us patience!
11234,"To hear, or forbear laughing?"
11235,"To hear meekly, sir, and to laugh moderately, or to forbear both."
11236,"Well, sir, be it as the style shall give us cause to climb in the"
11237,"The matter is to me, sir, as concerning Jaquenetta. The manner of it"
11238,"is, I was taken with the manner."
11239,"In manner and form following, sir, all those three. I was seen with her"
11240,"in the manor-house, sitting with her upon the form, and taken following"
11241,"her into the park, which, put together, is “in manner and form"
11242,"following”. Now, sir, for the manner. It is the manner of a man to"
11243,speak to a woman. For the form—in some form.
11244,"For the “following”, sir?"
11245,"As it shall follow in my correction, and God defend the right!"
11246,Will you hear this letter with attention?
11247,As we would hear an oracle.
11248,Such is the simplicity of man to hearken after the flesh.
11249,"Navarre, my soul’s earth’s god and body’s fostering patron—_"
11250,Not a word of Costard yet.
11251,"It may be so; but if he say it is so, he is, in telling true, but so."
11252,"Be to me, and every man that dares not fight."
11253,"Of other men’s secrets, I beseech you."
11254,commend the black-oppressing humour to the most wholesome physic of thy
11255,"health-giving air; and, as I am a gentleman, betook myself to walk. The"
11256,"time when? About the sixth hour, when beasts most graze, birds best"
11257,"peck, and men sit down to that nourishment which is called supper. So"
11258,"much for the time when. Now for the ground which? Which, I mean, I"
11259,"walked upon. It is ycleped thy park. Then for the place, where? Where,"
11260,"I mean, I did encounter that obscene and most preposterous event that"
11261,"draweth from my snow-white pen the ebon-coloured ink, which here thou"
11262,"viewest, beholdest, surveyest, or seest. But to the place where? It"
11263,standeth north-north-east and by east from the west corner of thy
11264,"curious-knotted garden. There did I see that low-spirited swain, that"
11265,base minnow of thy mirth—_
11266,"proclaimed edict and continent canon, which with, O, with—but with this"
11267,I passion to say wherewith—_
11268,"more sweet understanding, a woman. Him, I, as my ever-esteemed duty"
11269,"pricks me on, have sent to thee, to receive the meed of punishment, by"
11270,"thy sweet Grace’s officer, Antony Dull, a man of good repute, carriage,"
11271,"Me, an’t shall please you; I am Antony Dull."
11272,"apprehended with the aforesaid swain, I keep her as a vessel of thy"
11273,"law’s fury, and shall, at the least of thy sweet notice, bring her to"
11274,"trial. Thine, in all compliments of devoted and heartburning heat of"
11275,Don Adriano de Armado._
11276,"This is not so well as I looked for, but the best that ever I heard."
11277,"Ay, the best for the worst. But, sirrah, what say you to this?"
11278,"Sir, I confess the wench."
11279,Did you hear the proclamation?
11280,"I do confess much of the hearing it, but little of the marking of it."
11281,It was proclaimed a year’s imprisonment to be taken with a wench.
11282,"I was taken with none, sir. I was taken with a damsel."
11283,"Well, it was proclaimed “damsel”."
11284,"This was no damsel neither, sir; she was a virgin."
11285,"It is so varied too, for it was proclaimed “virgin”."
11286,"If it were, I deny her virginity. I was taken with a maid."
11287,"This maid will not serve your turn, sir."
11288,"This maid will serve my turn, sir."
11289,"Sir, I will pronounce your sentence: you shall fast a week with bran"
11290,I had rather pray a month with mutton and porridge.
11291,And Don Armado shall be your keeper.
11292,"My Lord Berowne, see him delivered o’er;"
11293,"And go we, lords, to put in practice that"
11294,Which each to other hath so strongly sworn.
11295,I’ll lay my head to any good man’s hat
11296,These oaths and laws will prove an idle scorn.
11297,"I suffer for the truth, sir; for true it is I was taken with"
11298,"Jaquenetta, and Jaquenetta is a true girl. And therefore welcome the"
11299,"sour cup of prosperity! Affliction may one day smile again, and till"
11300,"then, sit thee down, sorrow."
11301,SCENE II. The park
11302,"Enter Armado and Moth, his Page."
11303,"Boy, what sign is it when a man of great spirit grows melancholy?"
11304,"A great sign, sir, that he will look sad."
11305,"Why, sadness is one and the selfsame thing, dear imp."
11306,"No, no, O Lord, sir, no."
11307,"How canst thou part sadness and melancholy, my tender juvenal?"
11308,"By a familiar demonstration of the working, my tough signior."
11309,Why tough signior? Why tough signior?
11310,Why tender juvenal? Why tender juvenal?
11311,"I spoke it, tender juvenal, as a congruent epitheton appertaining to"
11312,"thy young days, which we may nominate tender."
11313,"And I, tough signior, as an appertinent title to your old time, which"
11314,we may name tough.
11315,"How mean you, sir? I pretty and my saying apt, or I apt, and my saying"
11316,"Thou pretty, because little."
11317,"Little pretty, because little. Wherefore apt?"
11318,"And therefore apt, because quick."
11319,"Speak you this in my praise, master?"
11320,In thy condign praise.
11321,I will praise an eel with the same praise.
11322,"What, that an eel is ingenious?"
11323,That an eel is quick.
11324,I do say thou art quick in answers. Thou heat’st my blood.
11325,"I am answered, sir."
11326,I love not to be crossed.
11327,I have promised to study three years with the Duke.
11328,"You may do it in an hour, sir."
11329,How many is one thrice told?
11330,I am ill at reckoning. It fitteth the spirit of a tapster.
11331,"You are a gentleman and a gamester, sir."
11332,I confess both. They are both the varnish of a complete man.
11333,Then I am sure you know how much the gross sum of deuce-ace amounts to.
11334,It doth amount to one more than two.
11335,Which the base vulgar do call three.
11336,"Why, sir, is this such a piece of study? Now here’s three studied ere"
11337,ye’ll thrice wink. And how easy it is to put “years” to the word
11338,"“three”, and study three years in two words, the dancing horse will"
11339,A most fine figure!
11340,I will hereupon confess I am in love; and as it is base for a soldier
11341,"to love, so am I in love with a base wench. If drawing my sword against"
11342,the humour of affection would deliver me from the reprobate thought of
11343,"it, I would take desire prisoner, and ransom him to any French courtier"
11344,for a new-devised curtsy. I think scorn to sigh; methinks I should
11345,"outswear Cupid. Comfort me, boy. What great men have been in love?"
11346,"Most sweet Hercules! More authority, dear boy, name more; and, sweet my"
11347,"child, let them be men of good repute and carriage."
11348,"Samson, master. He was a man of good carriage, great carriage, for he"
11349,"carried the town gates on his back like a porter, and he was in love."
11350,"O well-knit Samson, strong-jointed Samson! I do excel thee in my rapier"
11351,as much as thou didst me in carrying gates. I am in love too. Who was
11352,"Samson’s love, my dear Moth?"
11353,"Of all the four, or the three, or the two, or one of the four."
11354,Tell me precisely of what complexion.
11355,"Of the sea-water green, sir."
11356,Is that one of the four complexions?
11357,"As I have read, sir; and the best of them too."
11358,Green indeed is the colour of lovers. But to have a love of that
11359,"colour, methinks Samson had small reason for it. He surely affected her"
11360,"It was so, sir, for she had a green wit."
11361,My love is most immaculate white and red.
11362,"Most maculate thoughts, master, are masked under such colours."
11363,"Define, define, well-educated infant."
11364,My father’s wit and my mother’s tongue assist me!
11365,"Sweet invocation of a child, most pretty, and pathetical!"
11366,"If she be made of white and red,"
11367,Her faults will ne’er be known;
11368,"For blushing cheeks by faults are bred,"
11369,And fears by pale white shown.
11370,"Then if she fear, or be to blame,"
11371,"By this you shall not know,"
11372,For still her cheeks possess the same
11373,Which native she doth owe.
11374,"A dangerous rhyme, master, against the reason of white and red."
11375,"Is there not a ballad, boy, of the King and the Beggar?"
11376,"The world was very guilty of such a ballad some three ages since, but I"
11377,"think now ’tis not to be found; or if it were, it would neither serve"
11378,for the writing nor the tune.
11379,"I will have that subject newly writ o’er, that I may example my"
11380,"digression by some mighty precedent. Boy, I do love that country girl"
11381,that I took in the park with the rational hind Costard. She deserves
11382,"Sing, boy. My spirit grows heavy in love."
11383,"And that’s great marvel, loving a light wench."
11384,Forbear till this company be past.
11385,"Enter Costard the Clown, Dull the Constable and Jaquenetta a Wench."
11386,"Sir, the Duke’s pleasure is that you keep Costard safe; and you must"
11387,"suffer him to take no delight, nor no penance, but he must fast three"
11388,"days a week. For this damsel, I must keep her at the park. She is"
11389,allowed for the dey-woman. Fare you well.
11390,I do betray myself with blushing.—Maid.
11391,I will visit thee at the lodge.
11392,I know where it is situate.
11393,"Lord, how wise you are!"
11394,I will tell thee wonders.
11395,So I heard you say.
11396,Fair weather after you!
11397,"Villain, thou shalt fast for thy offences ere thou be pardoned."
11398,"Well, sir, I hope when I do it I shall do it on a full stomach."
11399,Thou shalt be heavily punished.
11400,"I am more bound to you than your fellows, for they are but lightly"
11401,Take away this villain. Shut him up.
11402,"Come, you transgressing slave, away!"
11403,"Let me not be pent up, sir. I will fast being loose."
11404,"No, sir, that were fast and loose. Thou shalt to prison."
11405,"Well, if ever I do see the merry days of desolation that I have seen,"
11406,What shall some see?
11407,"Nay, nothing, Master Moth, but what they look upon. It is not for"
11408,"prisoners to be too silent in their words, and therefore I will say"
11409,"nothing. I thank God I have as little patience as another man, and"
11410,therefore I can be quiet.
11411,"I do affect the very ground, which is base, where her shoe, which is"
11412,"baser, guided by her foot, which is basest, doth tread. I shall be"
11413,"forsworn, which is a great argument of falsehood, if I love. And how"
11414,can that be true love which is falsely attempted? Love is a familiar;
11415,Love is a devil. There is no evil angel but Love. Yet was Samson so
11416,"tempted, and he had an excellent strength; yet was Solomon so seduced,"
11417,and he had a very good wit. Cupid’s butt-shaft is too hard for
11418,"Hercules’ club, and therefore too much odds for a Spaniard’s rapier."
11419,The first and second cause will not serve my turn; the _passado_ he
11420,"respects not, the _duello_ he regards not. His disgrace is to be called"
11421,"boy, but his glory is to subdue men. Adieu, valour; rust, rapier; be"
11422,"still, drum, for your manager is in love. Yea, he loveth. Assist me,"
11423,"some extemporal god of rhyme, for I am sure I shall turn sonnet."
11424,"Devise, wit; write, pen; for I am for whole volumes in folio."
11425,SCENE I. The King of Navarre’s park. A pavilion and tents at a distance
11426,"Enter the Princess of France, with three attending Ladies: Rosaline,"
11427,"Maria, Katharine and three Lords: Boyet, and two others."
11428,"Now, madam, summon up your dearest spirits."
11429,"Consider who the King your father sends,"
11430,"To whom he sends, and what’s his embassy."
11431,"Yourself, held precious in the world’s esteem,"
11432,To parley with the sole inheritor
11433,"Of all perfections that a man may owe,"
11434,Matchless Navarre; the plea of no less weight
11435,"Than Aquitaine, a dowry for a queen."
11436,Be now as prodigal of all dear grace
11437,As Nature was in making graces dear
11438,When she did starve the general world beside
11439,And prodigally gave them all to you.
11440,"Good Lord Boyet, my beauty, though but mean,"
11441,Needs not the painted flourish of your praise.
11442,"Beauty is bought by judgement of the eye,"
11443,Not uttered by base sale of chapmen’s tongues.
11444,I am less proud to hear you tell my worth
11445,Than you much willing to be counted wise
11446,In spending your wit in the praise of mine.
11447,"But now to task the tasker: good Boyet,"
11448,"You are not ignorant, all-telling fame"
11449,"Doth noise abroad Navarre hath made a vow,"
11450,"Till painful study shall outwear three years,"
11451,No woman may approach his silent court.
11452,"Therefore to’s seemeth it a needful course,"
11453,"Before we enter his forbidden gates,"
11454,"To know his pleasure; and in that behalf,"
11455,"Bold of your worthiness, we single you"
11456,As our best-moving fair solicitor.
11457,"Tell him the daughter of the King of France,"
11458,"On serious business craving quick dispatch,"
11459,Importunes personal conference with his Grace.
11460,"Haste, signify so much, while we attend,"
11461,"Like humble-visaged suitors, his high will."
11462,"Proud of employment, willingly I go."
11463,"All pride is willing pride, and yours is so."
11464,"Who are the votaries, my loving lords,"
11465,That are vow-fellows with this virtuous Duke?
11466,Lord Longaville is one.
11467,Know you the man?
11468,"I know him, madam. At a marriage feast"
11469,Between Lord Perigort and the beauteous heir
11470,"Of Jaques Falconbridge, solemnized"
11471,"In Normandy, saw I this Longaville."
11472,"A man of sovereign parts, he is esteemed,"
11473,"Well fitted in arts, glorious in arms."
11474,Nothing becomes him ill that he would well.
11475,"The only soil of his fair virtue’s gloss,"
11476,"If virtue’s gloss will stain with any soil,"
11477,"Is a sharp wit matched with too blunt a will,"
11478,"Whose edge hath power to cut, whose will still wills"
11479,It should none spare that come within his power.
11480,"Some merry mocking lord, belike. Is’t so?"
11481,They say so most that most his humours know.
11482,Such short-lived wits do wither as they grow.
11483,Who are the rest?
11484,"The young Dumaine, a well-accomplished youth,"
11485,Of all that virtue love for virtue loved;
11486,"Most power to do most harm, least knowing ill,"
11487,"For he hath wit to make an ill shape good,"
11488,And shape to win grace though he had no wit.
11489,I saw him at the Duke Alençon’s once;
11490,And much too little of that good I saw
11491,Is my report to his great worthiness.
11492,Another of these students at that time
11493,"Was there with him, if I have heard a truth."
11494,"Berowne they call him, but a merrier man,"
11495,"Within the limit of becoming mirth,"
11496,I never spent an hour’s talk withal.
11497,"His eye begets occasion for his wit,"
11498,For every object that the one doth catch
11499,"The other turns to a mirth-moving jest,"
11500,"Which his fair tongue, conceit’s expositor,"
11501,Delivers in such apt and gracious words
11502,"That aged ears play truant at his tales,"
11503,"And younger hearings are quite ravished,"
11504,So sweet and voluble is his discourse.
11505,"God bless my ladies! Are they all in love,"
11506,That every one her own hath garnished
11507,With such bedecking ornaments of praise?
11508,"Now, what admittance, lord?"
11509,"Navarre had notice of your fair approach,"
11510,And he and his competitors in oath
11511,"Were all addressed to meet you, gentle lady,"
11512,"Before I came. Marry, thus much I have learned:"
11513,"He rather means to lodge you in the field,"
11514,"Like one that comes here to besiege his court,"
11515,"Than seek a dispensation for his oath,"
11516,To let you enter his unpeopled house.
11517,"Enter King of Navarre, Longaville, Dumaine, Berowne and Attendants."
11518,"Fair Princess, welcome to the court of Navarre."
11519,"“Fair” I give you back again, and “welcome” I have not yet. The roof of"
11520,"this court is too high to be yours, and welcome to the wide fields too"
11521,base to be mine.
11522,"You shall be welcome, madam, to my court."
11523,I will be welcome then. Conduct me thither.
11524,"Hear me, dear lady. I have sworn an oath."
11525,Our Lady help my lord! He’ll be forsworn.
11526,"Not for the world, fair madam, by my will."
11527,"Why, will shall break it; will, and nothing else."
11528,Your ladyship is ignorant what it is.
11529,"Were my lord so, his ignorance were wise,"
11530,Where now his knowledge must prove ignorance.
11531,I hear your Grace hath sworn out housekeeping.
11532,"’Tis deadly sin to keep that oath, my lord,"
11533,And sin to break it.
11534,"But pardon me, I am too sudden bold."
11535,To teach a teacher ill beseemeth me.
11536,"Vouchsafe to read the purpose of my coming,"
11537,And suddenly resolve me in my suit.
11538,"Madam, I will, if suddenly I may."
11539,"You will the sooner that I were away,"
11540,For you’ll prove perjured if you make me stay.
11541,Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?
11542,I know you did.
11543,How needless was it then
11544,To ask the question!
11545,You must not be so quick.
11546,’Tis long of you that spur me with such questions.
11547,"Your wit’s too hot, it speeds too fast, ’twill tire."
11548,Not till it leave the rider in the mire.
11549,What time o’ day?
11550,The hour that fools should ask.
11551,Now fair befall your mask.
11552,Fair fall the face it covers.
11553,And send you many lovers!
11554,"Amen, so you be none."
11555,"Nay, then will I be gone."
11556,"Madam, your father here doth intimate"
11557,"The payment of a hundred thousand crowns,"
11558,Being but the one half of an entire sum
11559,Disbursed by my father in his wars.
11560,"But say that he or we, as neither have,"
11561,"Received that sum, yet there remains unpaid"
11562,"A hundred thousand more, in surety of the which"
11563,"One part of Aquitaine is bound to us,"
11564,Although not valued to the money’s worth.
11565,If then the King your father will restore
11566,"But that one half which is unsatisfied,"
11567,"We will give up our right in Aquitaine,"
11568,And hold fair friendship with his majesty.
11569,"But that, it seems, he little purposeth;"
11570,For here he doth demand to have repaid
11571,"A hundred thousand crowns, and not demands,"
11572,"On payment of a hundred thousand crowns,"
11573,"To have his title live in Aquitaine,"
11574,"Which we much rather had depart withal,"
11575,"And have the money by our father lent,"
11576,"Than Aquitaine, so gelded as it is."
11577,"Dear Princess, were not his requests so far"
11578,"From reason’s yielding, your fair self should make"
11579,"A yielding ’gainst some reason in my breast,"
11580,And go well satisfied to France again.
11581,"You do the King my father too much wrong,"
11582,"And wrong the reputation of your name,"
11583,In so unseeming to confess receipt
11584,Of that which hath so faithfully been paid.
11585,I do protest I never heard of it;
11586,"And, if you prove it, I’ll repay it back"
11587,Or yield up Aquitaine.
11588,We arrest your word.
11589,"Boyet, you can produce acquittances"
11590,For such a sum from special officers
11591,Of Charles his father.
11592,"So please your Grace, the packet is not come"
11593,Where that and other specialties are bound.
11594,Tomorrow you shall have a sight of them.
11595,It shall suffice me; at which interview
11596,All liberal reason I will yield unto.
11597,Meantime receive such welcome at my hand
11598,"As honour, without breach of honour, may"
11599,Make tender of to thy true worthiness.
11600,"You may not come, fair Princess, in my gates,"
11601,But here without you shall be so received
11602,"As you shall deem yourself lodged in my heart,"
11603,Though so denied fair harbour in my house.
11604,"Your own good thoughts excuse me, and farewell."
11605,Tomorrow shall we visit you again.
11606,Sweet health and fair desires consort your Grace.
11607,Thy own wish wish I thee in every place.
11608,"Lady, I will commend you to mine own heart."
11609,"Pray you, do my commendations; I would be glad to see it."
11610,I would you heard it groan.
11611,Is the fool sick?
11612,Sick at the heart.
11613,"Alack, let it blood."
11614,Would that do it good?
11615,My physic says “ay”.
11616,Will you prick’t with your eye?
11617,"_Non point_, with my knife."
11618,"Now, God save thy life."
11619,And yours from long living.
11620,I cannot stay thanksgiving.
11621,"Sir, I pray you, a word. What lady is that same?"
11622,"The heir of Alençon, Katharine her name."
11623,"A gallant lady. Monsieur, fare you well."
11624,I beseech you a word. What is she in the white?
11625,"A woman sometimes, an you saw her in the light."
11626,Perchance light in the light. I desire her name.
11627,She hath but one for herself; to desire that were a shame.
11628,"Pray you, sir, whose daughter?"
11629,"Her mother’s, I have heard."
11630,God’s blessing on your beard!
11631,"Good sir, be not offended."
11632,She is an heir of Falconbridge.
11633,"Nay, my choler is ended."
11634,She is a most sweet lady.
11635,"Not unlike, sir; that may be."
11636,What’s her name in the cap?
11637,"Rosaline, by good hap."
11638,Is she wedded or no?
11639,"To her will, sir, or so."
11640,"You are welcome, sir. Adieu."
11641,"Farewell to me, sir, and welcome to you."
11642,"That last is Berowne, the merry madcap lord."
11643,Not a word with him but a jest.
11644,And every jest but a word.
11645,It was well done of you to take him at his word.
11646,I was as willing to grapple as he was to board.
11647,"Two hot sheeps, marry!"
11648,And wherefore not ships?
11649,"No sheep, sweet lamb, unless we feed on your lips."
11650,You sheep and I pasture. Shall that finish the jest?
11651,So you grant pasture for me.
11652,"Not so, gentle beast."
11653,"My lips are no common, though several they be."
11654,To my fortunes and me.
11655,"Good wits will be jangling; but, gentles, agree."
11656,This civil war of wits were much better used
11657,"On Navarre and his bookmen, for here ’tis abused."
11658,"If my observation, which very seldom lies,"
11659,"By the heart’s still rhetoric disclosed with eyes,"
11660,"Deceive me not now, Navarre is infected."
11661,With that which we lovers entitle “affected”.
11662,"Why, all his behaviours did make their retire"
11663,"To the court of his eye, peeping thorough desire."
11664,"His heart, like an agate, with your print impressed,"
11665,"Proud with his form, in his eye pride expressed."
11666,"His tongue, all impatient to speak and not see,"
11667,Did stumble with haste in his eyesight to be;
11668,"All senses to that sense did make their repair,"
11669,To feel only looking on fairest of fair.
11670,"Methought all his senses were locked in his eye,"
11671,As jewels in crystal for some prince to buy;
11672,"Who, tend’ring their own worth from where they were glassed,"
11673,"Did point you to buy them, along as you passed."
11674,His face’s own margent did quote such amazes
11675,That all eyes saw his eyes enchanted with gazes.
11676,"I’ll give you Aquitaine, and all that is his,"
11677,An you give him for my sake but one loving kiss.
11678,"Come, to our pavilion. Boyet is disposed."
11679,But to speak that in words which his eye hath disclosed.
11680,I only have made a mouth of his eye
11681,By adding a tongue which I know will not lie.
11682,"Thou art an old love-monger, and speakest skilfully."
11683,"He is Cupid’s grandfather, and learns news of him."
11684,Then was Venus like her mother; for her father is but grim.
11685,"Do you hear, my mad wenches?"
11686,"What, then, do you see?"
11687,"Ay, our way to be gone."
11688,You are too hard for me.
11689,SCENE I. The King of Navarre’s park
11690,Enter Armado the Braggart and Moth his Boy.
11691,"Warble, child, make passionate my sense of hearing."
11692,"Sweet air! Go, tenderness of years, take this key, give enlargement to"
11693,"the swain, bring him festinately hither. I must employ him in a letter"
11694,"Master, will you win your love with a French brawl?"
11695,How meanest thou? Brawling in French?
11696,"No, my complete master; but to jig off a tune at the tongue’s end,"
11697,"canary to it with your feet, humour it with turning up your eyelids,"
11698,"sigh a note and sing a note, sometime through the throat, as if you"
11699,"swallowed love with singing love, sometime through the nose, as if you"
11700,snuffed up love by smelling love; with your hat penthouse-like o’er the
11701,"shop of your eyes, with your arms crossed on your thin-belly doublet"
11702,like a rabbit on a spit; or your hands in your pocket like a man after
11703,"the old painting; and keep not too long in one tune, but a snip and"
11704,"away. These are compliments, these are humours; these betray nice"
11705,wenches that would be betrayed without these; and make them men of
11706,note—do you note me?—that most are affected to these.
11707,How hast thou purchased this experience?
11708,By my penny of observation.
11709,“The hobby-horse is forgot.”
11710,Call’st thou my love “hobby-horse”?
11711,"No, master. The hobby-horse is but a colt, and your love perhaps a"
11712,hackney. But have you forgot your love?
11713,Negligent student! Learn her by heart.
11714,"By heart and in heart, boy."
11715,"And out of heart, master. All those three I will prove."
11716,What wilt thou prove?
11717,"A man, if I live; and this, “by, in, and without,” upon the instant:"
11718,"“by” heart you love her, because your heart cannot come by her; “in”"
11719,"heart you love her, because your heart is in love with her; and “out”"
11720,"of heart you love her, being out of heart that you cannot enjoy her."
11721,I am all these three.
11722,"And three times as much more, and yet nothing at all."
11723,Fetch hither the swain. He must carry me a letter.
11724,A message well sympathized: a horse to be ambassador for an ass.
11725,"Ha, ha, what sayest thou?"
11726,"Marry, sir, you must send the ass upon the horse, for he is very"
11727,slow-gaited. But I go.
11728,The way is but short. Away!
11729,"As swift as lead, sir."
11730,"The meaning, pretty ingenious?"
11731,"Is not lead a metal heavy, dull, and slow?"
11732,"_Minime_, honest master; or rather, master, no."
11733,I say lead is slow.
11734,"You are too swift, sir, to say so."
11735,Is that lead slow which is fired from a gun?
11736,Sweet smoke of rhetoric!
11737,"He reputes me a cannon; and the bullet, that’s he."
11738,I shoot thee at the swain.
11739,"Thump then, and I flee."
11740,"A most acute juvenal, voluble and free of grace!"
11741,"By thy favour, sweet welkin, I must sigh in thy face."
11742,"Most rude melancholy, valour gives thee place."
11743,My herald is returned.
11744,Enter Moth and Costard.
11745,"A wonder, master! Here’s a costard broken in a shin."
11746,"Some enigma, some riddle. Come, thy _l’envoi_ begin."
11747,"No egma, no riddle, no _l’envoi_, no salve in the mail, sir. O, sir,"
11748,"plantain, a plain plantain! No _l’envoi_, no _l’envoi_, no salve, sir,"
11749,"By virtue, thou enforcest laughter; thy silly thought, my spleen; the"
11750,"heaving of my lungs provokes me to ridiculous smiling. O, pardon me, my"
11751,"stars! Doth the inconsiderate take _salve_ for _l’envoi_, and the word"
11752,_l’envoi_ for a _salve?_
11753,Do the wise think them other? Is not _l’envoi_ a _salve?_
11754,"No, page; it is an epilogue or discourse to make plain"
11755,Some obscure precedence that hath tofore been sain.
11756,I will example it:
11757,"The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee"
11758,"Were still at odds, being but three."
11759,There’s the moral. Now the _l’envoi_.
11760,I will add the _l’envoi_. Say the moral again.
11761,"The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee"
11762,"Were still at odds, being but three."
11763,"Until the goose came out of door,"
11764,And stayed the odds by adding four.
11765,"Now will I begin your moral, and do you follow with my _l’envoi_."
11766,"The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee"
11767,"Were still at odds, being but three."
11768,"Until the goose came out of door,"
11769,Staying the odds by adding four.
11770,"A good _l’envoi_, ending in the goose. Would you desire more?"
11771,"The boy hath sold him a bargain, a goose, that’s flat."
11772,"Sir, your pennyworth is good, an your goose be fat."
11773,To sell a bargain well is as cunning as fast and loose.
11774,"Let me see: a fat _l’envoi_—ay, that’s a fat goose."
11775,"Come hither, come hither. How did this argument begin?"
11776,By saying that a costard was broken in a shin.
11777,Then called you for the _l’envoi_.
11778,"True, and I for a plantain. Thus came your argument in. Then the boy’s"
11779,"fat _l’envoi_, the goose that you bought; and he ended the market."
11780,"But tell me, how was there a costard broken in a shin?"
11781,I will tell you sensibly.
11782,"Thou hast no feeling of it, Moth. I will speak that _l’envoi_."
11783,"I, Costard, running out, that was safely within,"
11784,Fell over the threshold and broke my shin.
11785,We will talk no more of this matter.
11786,Till there be more matter in the shin.
11787,"Sirrah Costard, I will enfranchise thee."
11788,"O, marry me to one Frances! I smell some _l’envoi_, some goose, in"
11789,"By my sweet soul, I mean setting thee at liberty, enfreedoming thy"
11790,"person. Thou wert immured, restrained, captivated, bound."
11791,"True, true; and now you will be my purgation, and let me loose."
11792,"I give thee thy liberty, set thee from durance, and, in lieu thereof,"
11793,impose on thee nothing but this: [_Giving him a letter_.] bear this
11794,significant to the country maid Jaquenetta. [_Giving money_.] There is
11795,remuneration for the best ward of mine honour is rewarding my
11796,"Like the sequel, I. Signior Costard, adieu."
11797,"My sweet ounce of man’s flesh, my incony Jew!"
11798,"Now will I look to his remuneration. “Remuneration”! O, that’s the"
11799,Latin word for three farthings. Three farthings—_remuneration_. “What’s
11800,"the price of this inkle?” “One penny.” “No, I’ll give you a"
11801,"remuneration.” Why, it carries it! _Remuneration_. Why, it is a fairer"
11802,name than French crown. I will never buy and sell out of this word.
11803,"My good knave Costard, exceedingly well met."
11804,"Pray you, sir, how much carnation ribbon may a man buy for a"
11805,What is a remuneration?
11806,"Marry, sir, halfpenny farthing."
11807,"Why, then, three-farthing worth of silk."
11808,I thank your worship. God be wi’ you.
11809,"Stay, slave. I must employ thee."
11810,"As thou wilt win my favour, good my knave,"
11811,Do one thing for me that I shall entreat.
11812,"When would you have it done, sir?"
11813,"Well, I will do it, sir. Fare you well."
11814,Thou knowest not what it is.
11815,"I shall know, sir, when I have done it."
11816,"Why, villain, thou must know first."
11817,I will come to your worship tomorrow morning.
11818,"It must be done this afternoon. Hark, slave, it is but this:"
11819,"The Princess comes to hunt here in the park,"
11820,And in her train there is a gentle lady;
11821,"When tongues speak sweetly, then they name her name,"
11822,And Rosaline they call her. Ask for her
11823,And to her white hand see thou do commend
11824,There’s thy guerdon. Go.
11825,"Gardon, O sweet gardon! Better than remuneration, a ’levenpence"
11826,"farthing better. Most sweet gardon! I will do it, sir, in print."
11827,"And I, forsooth, in love! I, that have been love’s whip,"
11828,"A very beadle to a humorous sigh,"
11829,"A critic, nay, a night-watch constable,"
11830,"A domineering pedant o’er the boy,"
11831,Than whom no mortal so magnificent!
11832,"This wimpled, whining, purblind, wayward boy,"
11833,"This Signior Junior, giant-dwarf, Dan Cupid,"
11834,"Regent of love-rhymes, lord of folded arms,"
11835,"Th’ anointed sovereign of sighs and groans,"
11836,"Liege of all loiterers and malcontents,"
11837,"Dread prince of plackets, king of codpieces,"
11838,"Sole imperator, and great general"
11839,Of trotting paritors—O my little heart!
11840,And I to be a corporal of his field
11841,And wear his colours like a tumbler’s hoop!
11842,"What? I love, I sue, I seek a wife?"
11843,"A woman, that is like a German clock,"
11844,"Still a-repairing, ever out of frame,"
11845,"And never going aright, being a watch,"
11846,But being watched that it may still go right!
11847,"Nay, to be perjured, which is worst of all;"
11848,"And, among three, to love the worst of all,"
11849,"A whitely wanton with a velvet brow,"
11850,With two pitch-balls stuck in her face for eyes;
11851,"Ay, and, by heaven, one that will do the deed"
11852,Though Argus were her eunuch and her guard.
11853,"And I to sigh for her, to watch for her,"
11854,"To pray for her! Go to, it is a plague"
11855,That Cupid will impose for my neglect
11856,Of his almighty dreadful little might.
11857,"Well, I will love, write, sigh, pray, sue, and groan."
11858,"Some men must love my lady, and some Joan."
11859,SCENE I. The King of Navarre’s park
11860,"Enter the Princess, a Forester, Rosaline, Maria, Katharine, Boyet and"
11861,Was that the King that spurred his horse so hard
11862,Against the steep uprising of the hill?
11863,"I know not, but I think it was not he."
11864,"Whoe’er he was, he showed a mounting mind."
11865,"Well, lords, today we shall have our dispatch;"
11866,On Saturday we will return to France.
11867,"Then, forester, my friend, where is the bush"
11868,That we must stand and play the murderer in?
11869,"Hereby, upon the edge of yonder coppice,"
11870,A stand where you may make “the fairest shoot”.
11871,"I thank my beauty, I am fair that shoot,"
11872,And thereupon thou speak’st the fairest shoot.
11873,"Pardon me, madam, for I meant not so."
11874,"What, what? First praise me, and again say no?"
11875,O short-lived pride! Not fair? Alack for woe!
11876,"Nay, never paint me now."
11877,"Where fair is not, praise cannot mend the brow."
11878,"Here, good my glass, take this for telling true:"
11879,Fair payment for foul words is more than due.
11880,Nothing but fair is that which you inherit.
11881,"See, see, my beauty will be saved by merit."
11882,"O heresy in fair, fit for these days!"
11883,"A giving hand, though foul, shall have fair praise."
11884,"But come, the bow. Now mercy goes to kill,"
11885,And shooting well is then accounted ill.
11886,Thus will I save my credit in the shoot:
11887,"Not wounding, pity would not let me do’t;"
11888,"If wounding, then it was to show my skill,"
11889,That more for praise than purpose meant to kill.
11890,"And out of question so it is sometimes,"
11891,"Glory grows guilty of detested crimes,"
11892,"When, for fame’s sake, for praise, an outward part,"
11893,We bend to that the working of the heart;
11894,As I for praise alone now seek to spill
11895,"The poor deer’s blood, that my heart means no ill."
11896,Do not curst wives hold that self-sovereignty
11897,"Only for praise’ sake, when they strive to be"
11898,Lords o’er their lords?
11899,Only for praise; and praise we may afford
11900,To any lady that subdues a lord.
11901,Here comes a member of the commonwealth.
11902,"God dig-you-den all! Pray you, which is the head lady?"
11903,"Thou shalt know her, fellow, by the rest that have no heads."
11904,"Which is the greatest lady, the highest?"
11905,The thickest and the tallest.
11906,"The thickest and the tallest. It is so, truth is truth."
11907,"An your waist, mistress, were as slender as my wit,"
11908,One o’ these maids’ girdles for your waist should be fit.
11909,Are not you the chief woman? You are the thickest here.
11910,"What’s your will, sir? What’s your will?"
11911,I have a letter from Monsieur Berowne to one Lady Rosaline.
11912,"O, thy letter, thy letter! He’s a good friend of mine."
11913,"Stand aside, good bearer. Boyet, you can carve."
11914,Break up this capon.
11915,I am bound to serve.
11916,This letter is mistook; it importeth none here.
11917,It is writ to Jaquenetta.
11918,"We will read it, I swear."
11919,"Break the neck of the wax, and everyone give ear."
11920,thou art beauteous; truth itself that thou art lovely. More fairer than
11921,"fair, beautiful than beauteous, truer than truth itself, have"
11922,commiseration on thy heroical vassal. The magnanimous and most
11923,illustrate King Cophetua set eye upon the pernicious and indubitate
11924,"beggar Zenelophon, and he it was that might rightly say,_ “Veni, vidi,"
11925,"vici,” _which to annothanize in the vulgar—O base and obscure"
11926,"vulgar!_—videlicet, _He came, see, and overcame. He came, one; see,"
11927,"two; overcame, three. Who came? The King. Why did he come? To see. Why"
11928,did he see? To overcome. To whom came he? To the beggar. What saw he?
11929,The beggar. Who overcame he? The beggar. The conclusion is victory. On
11930,whose side? The King’s. The captive is enriched. On whose side? The
11931,"beggar’s. The catastrophe is a nuptial. On whose side? The King’s? No,"
11932,"on both in one, or one in both. I am the King, for so stands the"
11933,"comparison; thou the beggar, for so witnesseth thy lowliness. Shall I"
11934,command thy love? I may. Shall I enforce thy love? I could. Shall I
11935,entreat thy love? I will. What shalt thou exchange for rags? Robes. For
11936,"tittles? Titles. For thyself? Me. Thus expecting thy reply, I profane"
11937,"my lips on thy foot, my eyes on thy picture, and my heart on thy every"
11938,"Thine in the dearest design of industry,"
11939,Don Adriano de Armado.
11940,Thus dost thou hear the Nemean lion roar
11941,"’Gainst thee, thou lamb, that standest as his prey."
11942,"Submissive fall his princely feet before,"
11943,And he from forage will incline to play.
11944,"But if thou strive, poor soul, what are thou then?"
11945,"Food for his rage, repasture for his den._"
11946,What plume of feathers is he that indited this letter?
11947,What vane? What weathercock? Did you ever hear better?
11948,I am much deceived but I remember the style.
11949,"Else your memory is bad, going o’er it erewhile."
11950,"This Armado is a Spaniard that keeps here in court,"
11951,"A phantasime, a Monarcho, and one that makes sport"
11952,To the Prince and his book-mates.
11953,"Thou, fellow, a word."
11954,Who gave thee this letter?
11955,I told you: my lord.
11956,To whom shouldst thou give it?
11957,From my lord to my lady.
11958,From which lord to which lady?
11959,"From my Lord Berowne, a good master of mine,"
11960,To a lady of France that he called Rosaline.
11961,"Thou hast mistaken his letter. Come, lords, away."
11962,"Here, sweet, put up this: ’twill be thine another day."
11963,Who is the shooter? Who is the shooter?
11964,Shall I teach you to know?
11965,"Ay, my continent of beauty."
11966,"Why, she that bears the bow."
11967,"My lady goes to kill horns, but if thou marry,"
11968,Hang me by the neck if horns that year miscarry.
11969,"Well, then, I am the shooter."
11970,And who is your deer?
11971,"If we choose by the horns, yourself come not near."
11972,Finely put on indeed!
11973,"You still wrangle with her, Boyet, and she strikes at the brow."
11974,But she herself is hit lower. Have I hit her now?
11975,"Shall I come upon thee with an old saying, that was a man when King"
11976,"Pepin of France was a little boy, as touching the hit it?"
11977,"So I may answer thee with one as old, that was a woman when Queen"
11978,"Guinevere of Britain was a little wench, as touching the hit it."
11979,"Thou canst not hit it, hit it, hit it,"
11980,"Thou canst not hit it, my good man."
11981,"An I cannot, cannot, cannot,"
11982,"An I cannot, another can."
11983,"By my troth, most pleasant. How both did fit it!"
11984,"A mark marvellous well shot, for they both did hit it."
11985,"A mark! O, mark but that mark! A mark, says my lady!"
11986,"Let the mark have a prick in’t, to mete at, if it may be."
11987,"Wide o’ the bow hand! I’ faith, your hand is out."
11988,"Indeed, a’ must shoot nearer, or he’ll ne’er hit the clout."
11989,"An if my hand be out, then belike your hand is in."
11990,Then will she get the upshoot by cleaving the pin.
11991,"Come, come, you talk greasily, your lips grow foul."
11992,"She’s too hard for you at pricks, sir. Challenge her to bowl."
11993,"I fear too much rubbing. Good night, my good owl."
11994,"By my soul, a swain, a most simple clown!"
11995,"Lord, Lord, how the ladies and I have put him down!"
11996,"O’ my troth, most sweet jests, most incony vulgar wit,"
11997,"When it comes so smoothly off, so obscenely, as it were, so fit."
11998,"Armado, o’ the one side, O, a most dainty man!"
11999,To see him walk before a lady and to bear her fan!
12000,To see him kiss his hand and how most sweetly he will swear!
12001,"And his page o’ t’other side, that handful of wit!"
12002,"Ah, heavens, it is a most pathetical nit."
12003,SCENE II. The same
12004,"Enter Dull, Holofernes, the Pedant and Nathaniel."
12005,"Very reverend sport, truly, and done in the testimony of a good"
12006,"The deer was, as you know, _sanguis_, in blood, ripe as the pomewater,"
12007,"who now hangeth like a jewel in the ear of _caelo_, the sky, the"
12008,"welkin, the heaven, and anon falleth like a crab on the face of"
12009,"_terra_, the soil, the land, the earth."
12010,"Truly, Master Holofernes, the epithets are sweetly varied, like a"
12011,"scholar at the least. But, sir, I assure ye it was a buck of the first"
12012,"Sir Nathaniel, _haud credo_."
12013,"’Twas not a “auld grey doe”, ’twas a pricket."
12014,"Most barbarous intimation! Yet a kind of insinuation, as it were, _in"
12015,"via_, in way, of explication; _facere_, as it were, replication, or"
12016,"rather, _ostentare_, to show, as it were, his inclination, after his"
12017,"undressed, unpolished, uneducated, unpruned, untrained, or rather,"
12018,"unlettered, or ratherest, unconfirmed fashion, to insert again my _haud"
12019,credo_ for a deer.
12020,"I said the deer was not a “auld grey doe”, ’twas a pricket."
12021,"Twice-sod simplicity, _bis coctus!_"
12022,"O, thou monster Ignorance, how deformed dost thou look!"
12023,"Sir, he hath never fed of the dainties that are bred of a book."
12024,"He hath not eat paper, as it were; he hath not drunk ink."
12025,"His intellect is not replenished; he is only an animal, only sensible"
12026,in the duller parts.
12027,And such barren plants are set before us that we thankful should be—
12028,Which we of taste and feeling are—for those parts that do fructify in
12029,us more than he.
12030,"For as it would ill become me to be vain, indiscreet, or a fool,"
12031,"So, were there a patch set on learning, to see him in a school."
12032,"But, _omne bene_, say I, being of an old father’s mind;"
12033,Many can brook the weather that love not the wind.
12034,You two are bookmen. Can you tell me by your wit
12035,"What was a month old at Cain’s birth, that’s not five weeks old as yet?"
12036,"Dictynna, goodman Dull. Dictynna, goodman Dull."
12037,"A title to Phoebe, to Luna, to the moon."
12038,"The moon was a month old when Adam was no more,"
12039,And raught not to five weeks when he came to five-score.
12040,Th’ allusion holds in the exchange.
12041,"’Tis true, indeed. The collusion holds in the exchange."
12042,"God comfort thy capacity! I say, th’ allusion holds in the exchange."
12043,"And I say the pollution holds in the exchange, for the moon is never"
12044,but a month old; and I say beside that ’twas a pricket that the
12045,"Sir Nathaniel, will you hear an extemporal epitaph on the death of the"
12046,"deer? And, to humour the ignorant, call I the deer the Princess killed"
12047,"_Perge_, good Master Holofernes, _perge_, so it shall please you to"
12048,I will something affect the letter; for it argues facility.
12049,The preyful Princess pierced and pricked a pretty pleasing pricket;
12050,Some say a sore; but not a sore till now made sore with shooting.
12051,"The dogs did yell, put “l” to sore, then sorel jumps from thicket;"
12052,"Or pricket sore, or else sorel, the people fall a-hooting."
12053,"If sore be sore, then “L” to “sore” makes fifty sores o’ sorel."
12054,"Of one sore I an hundred make, by adding but one more “L”."
12055,"This is a gift that I have, simple, simple; a foolish extravagant"
12056,"spirit, full of forms, figures, shapes, objects, ideas, apprehensions,"
12057,"motions, revolutions. These are begot in the ventricle of memory,"
12058,"nourished in the womb of _pia mater_, and delivered upon the mellowing"
12059,"of occasion. But the gift is good in those in whom it is acute, and I"
12060,am thankful for it.
12061,"Sir, I praise the Lord for you, and so may my parishioners, for their"
12062,"sons are well tutored by you, and their daughters profit very greatly"
12063,under you. You are a good member of the commonwealth.
12064,"_Mehercle!_ If their sons be ingenious, they shall want no instruction;"
12065,"if their daughters be capable, I will put it to them. But, _vir sapit"
12066,qui pauca loquitur_. A soul feminine saluteth us.
12067,Enter Jaquenetta and Costard.
12068,"God give you good morrow, Master Person."
12069,"Master Person, _quasi_ pierce one. And if one should be pierced, which"
12070,"Marry, Master schoolmaster, he that is likest to a hogshead."
12071,Of piercing a hogshead! A good lustre or conceit in a turf of earth;
12072,"fire enough for a flint, pearl enough for a swine. ’Tis pretty; it is"
12073,"Good Master Parson, be so good as read me this letter. It was given me"
12074,"by Costard, and sent me from Don Armado. I beseech you read it."
12075,"_Fauste precor, gelida quando pecus omne sub umbra Ruminat_—"
12076,"and so forth. Ah, good old Mantuan, I may speak of thee as the"
12077,traveller doth of Venice:
12078,"Chi non ti vede, non ti pretia._"
12079,"Old Mantuan, old Mantuan! Who understandeth thee not, loves thee not."
12080,"Ut, re, sol, la, mi, fa."
12081,"Under pardon, sir, what are the contents? Or rather as Horace says in"
12082,"his—What, my soul, verses?"
12083,"Ay, sir, and very learned."
12084,"Let me hear a staff, a stanze, a verse,"
12085,"_If love make me forsworn, how shall I swear to love?"
12086,"Ah, never faith could hold, if not to beauty vowed."
12087,"Though to myself forsworn, to thee I’ll faithful prove."
12088,"Those thoughts to me were oaks, to thee like osiers bowed."
12089,"Study his bias leaves, and makes his book thine eyes,"
12090,Where all those pleasures live that art would comprehend.
12091,"If knowledge be the mark, to know thee shall suffice."
12092,"Well learned is that tongue that well can thee commend,"
12093,All ignorant that soul that sees thee without wonder;
12094,"Which is to me some praise, that I thy parts admire."
12095,"Thy eye Jove’s lightning bears, thy voice his dreadful thunder,"
12096,"Which, not to anger bent, is music and sweet fire."
12097,"Celestial as thou art, O, pardon love this wrong,"
12098,That sings heaven’s praise with such an earthly tongue._
12099,"You find not the apostrophus, and so miss the accent. Let me supervise"
12100,"the canzonet. [_He takes the letter_.] Here are only numbers ratified,"
12101,"but, for the elegancy, facility, and golden cadence of poesy, _caret_."
12102,"Ovidius Naso was the man. And why indeed “Naso,” but for smelling out"
12103,"the odoriferous flowers of fancy, the jerks of invention? _Imitari_ is"
12104,"nothing: so doth the hound his master, the ape his keeper, the tired"
12105,"horse his rider. But, damosella virgin, was this directed to you?"
12106,"Ay, sir, from one Monsieur Berowne, one of the strange queen’s lords."
12107,I will overglance the superscript: _To the snow-white hand of the most
12108,beauteous Lady Rosaline._ I will look again on the intellect of the
12109,"letter, for the nomination of the party writing to the person written"
12110,"unto: _Your Ladyship’s in all desired employment, Berowne._ Sir"
12111,"Nathaniel, this Berowne is one of the votaries with the King, and here"
12112,"he hath framed a letter to a sequent of the stranger queen’s, which"
12113,"accidentally, or by the way of progression, hath miscarried. Trip and"
12114,"go, my sweet, deliver this paper into the royal hand of the King. It"
12115,may concern much. Stay not thy compliment. I forgive thy duty. Adieu.
12116,"Good Costard, go with me. Sir, God save your life."
12117,"Have with thee, my girl."
12118,"Sir, you have done this in the fear of God, very religiously; and, as a"
12119,"Sir, tell not me of the Father, I do fear colourable colours. But to"
12120,"return to the verses: did they please you, Sir Nathaniel?"
12121,Marvellous well for the pen.
12122,"I do dine today at the father’s of a certain pupil of mine, where if,"
12123,"before repast, it shall please you to gratify the table with a grace, I"
12124,"will, on my privilege I have with the parents of the foresaid child or"
12125,"pupil, undertake your _ben venuto;_ where I will prove those verses to"
12126,"be very unlearned, neither savouring of poetry, wit, nor invention. I"
12127,"And thank you too; for society, saith the text, is the happiness of"
12128,"And certes, the text most infallibly concludes it. [_To Dull_.] Sir, I"
12129,do invite you too. You shall not say me nay. _Pauca verba_. Away! The
12130,"gentles are at their game, and we will to our recreation."
12131,SCENE III. The same
12132,"Enter Berowne with a paper in his hand, alone."
12133,"The King, he is hunting the deer; I am coursing myself. They have"
12134,"pitched a toil; I am toiling in a pitch, pitch that defiles. Defile! A"
12135,"foul word! Well, set thee down, sorrow, for so they say the fool said,"
12136,"and so say I, and I the fool. Well proved, wit! By the Lord, this love"
12137,"is as mad as Ajax. It kills sheep, it kills me, I a sheep. Well proved"
12138,"again, o’ my side! I will not love; if I do, hang me! I’ faith, I will"
12139,"not. O, but her eye! By this light, but for her eye, I would not love"
12140,"her; yes, for her two eyes. Well, I do nothing in the world but lie,"
12141,"and lie in my throat. By heaven, I do love, and it hath taught me to"
12142,"rhyme, and to be melancholy. And here is part of my rhyme, and here my"
12143,"melancholy. Well, she hath one o’ my sonnets already. The clown bore"
12144,"it, the fool sent it, and the lady hath it. Sweet clown, sweeter fool,"
12145,"sweetest lady! By the world, I would not care a pin if the other three"
12146,were in. Here comes one with a paper. God give him grace to groan!
12147,Enter the King with a paper.
12148,"with thy birdbolt under the left pap. In faith, secrets!"
12149,"To those fresh morning drops upon the rose,"
12150,"As thy eye-beams, when their fresh rays have smote"
12151,The night of dew that on my cheeks down flows.
12152,Nor shines the silver moon one half so bright
12153,Through the transparent bosom of the deep
12154,"As doth thy face, through tears of mine give light."
12155,Thou shin’st in every tear that I do weep.
12156,No drop but as a coach doth carry thee;
12157,So ridest thou triumphing in my woe.
12158,"Do but behold the tears that swell in me,"
12159,And they thy glory through my grief will show.
12160,But do not love thyself; then thou wilt keep
12161,"My tears for glasses, and still make me weep."
12162,"O queen of queens, how far dost thou excel"
12163,"No thought can think, nor tongue of mortal tell._"
12164,How shall she know my griefs? I’ll drop the paper.
12165,"Sweet leaves, shade folly. Who is he comes here?"
12166,"What, Longaville, and reading! Listen, ear."
12167,Enter Longaville with a paper.
12168,Ay me! I am forsworn.
12169,"Why, he comes in like a perjure, wearing papers."
12170,"In love, I hope. Sweet fellowship in shame."
12171,One drunkard loves another of the name.
12172,Am I the first that have been perjured so?
12173,I could put thee in comfort: not by two that I know.
12174,"Thou makest the triumviry, the corner-cap of society,"
12175,"The shape of love’s Tyburn, that hangs up simplicity."
12176,I fear these stubborn lines lack power to move.
12177,"O sweet Maria, empress of my love,"
12178,"These numbers will I tear, and write in prose."
12179,"O, rhymes are guards on wanton Cupid’s hose."
12180,Disfigure not his shop.
12181,This same shall go.
12182,"_Did not the heavenly rhetoric of thine eye,"
12183,"’Gainst whom the world cannot hold argument,"
12184,Persuade my heart to this false perjury?
12185,Vows for thee broke deserve not punishment.
12186,"A woman I forswore, but I will prove,"
12187,"Thou being a goddess, I forswore not thee."
12188,"My vow was earthly, thou a heavenly love;"
12189,"Thy grace being gained, cures all disgrace in me."
12190,"Vows are but breath, and breath a vapour is."
12191,"Then thou, fair sun, which on my earth dost shine,"
12192,Exhal’st this vapour-vow; in thee it is.
12193,"If broken then, it is no fault of mine;"
12194,"If by me broke, what fool is not so wise"
12195,To lose an oath to win a paradise?_
12196,"This is the liver vein, which makes flesh a deity,"
12197,"A green goose a goddess. Pure, pure idolatry."
12198,"God amend us, God amend! We are much out o’ th’ way."
12199,By whom shall I send this?—Company! Stay.
12200,Enter Dumaine with a paper.
12201,"All hid, all hid, an old infant play."
12202,"Like a demigod here sit I in the sky,"
12203,And wretched fools’ secrets heedfully o’er-eye.
12204,"More sacks to the mill. O heavens, I have my wish."
12205,Dumaine transformed! Four woodcocks in a dish!
12206,O most divine Kate!
12207,O most profane coxcomb!
12208,"By heaven, the wonder in a mortal eye!"
12209,"By earth, she is but corporal. There you lie."
12210,Her amber hairs for foul hath amber quoted.
12211,An amber-coloured raven was well noted.
12212,As upright as the cedar.
12213,Her shoulder is with child.
12214,As fair as day.
12215,"Ay, as some days, but then no sun must shine."
12216,"O, that I had my wish!"
12217,And I had mine!
12218,"And I mine too, good Lord!"
12219,"Amen, so I had mine. Is not that a good word?"
12220,I would forget her; but a fever she
12221,"Reigns in my blood, and will remembered be."
12222,"A fever in your blood? Why, then incision"
12223,Would let her out in saucers. Sweet misprision!
12224,Once more I’ll read the ode that I have writ.
12225,Once more I’ll mark how love can vary wit.
12226,_On a day—alack the day!—
12227,"Love, whose month is ever May,"
12228,Spied a blossom passing fair
12229,Playing in the wanton air.
12230,"Through the velvet leaves the wind,"
12231,"All unseen, can passage find;"
12232,"That the lover, sick to death,"
12233,Wished himself the heaven’s breath.
12234,"“Air,” quoth he, “thy cheeks may blow;"
12235,"Air, would I might triumph so!”"
12236,"But, alack, my hand is sworn"
12237,Ne’er to pluck thee from thy thorn.
12238,"Vow, alack, for youth unmeet,"
12239,Youth so apt to pluck a sweet.
12240,"Do not call it sin in me,"
12241,That I am forsworn for thee;
12242,Thou for whom Jove would swear
12243,"Juno but an Ethiope were,"
12244,"And deny himself for Jove,"
12245,Turning mortal for thy love._
12246,"This will I send, and something else more plain,"
12247,That shall express my true love’s fasting pain.
12248,"O, would the King, Berowne and Longaville"
12249,"Were lovers too! Ill, to example ill,"
12250,"Would from my forehead wipe a perjured note,"
12251,For none offend where all alike do dote.
12252,That in love’s grief desir’st society.
12253,"You may look pale, but I should blush, I know,"
12254,To be o’erheard and taken napping so.
12255,"You chide at him, offending twice as much."
12256,You do not love Maria? Longaville
12257,"Did never sonnet for her sake compile,"
12258,Nor never lay his wreathed arms athwart
12259,His loving bosom to keep down his heart.
12260,"I have been closely shrouded in this bush,"
12261,"And marked you both, and for you both did blush."
12262,"I heard your guilty rhymes, observed your fashion,"
12263,"Saw sighs reek from you, noted well your passion."
12264,"“Ay, me!” says one. “O Jove!” the other cries."
12265,"One, her hairs were gold; crystal the other’s eyes."
12266,What will Berowne say when that he shall hear
12267,Faith infringed which such zeal did swear?
12268,"How will he scorn, how will he spend his wit!"
12269,"How will he triumph, leap, and laugh at it!"
12270,"For all the wealth that ever I did see,"
12271,I would not have him know so much by me.
12272,Now step I forth to whip hypocrisy.
12273,"Ah, good my liege, I pray thee pardon me."
12274,"Good heart, what grace hast thou thus to reprove"
12275,"These worms for loving, that art most in love?"
12276,Your eyes do make no coaches; in your tears
12277,There is no certain princess that appears.
12278,"You’ll not be perjured, ’tis a hateful thing:"
12279,"Tush, none but minstrels like of sonneting!"
12280,"But are you not ashamed? Nay, are you not,"
12281,"All three of you, to be thus much o’ershot?"
12282,"You found his mote, the King your mote did see;"
12283,But I a beam do find in each of three.
12284,"O, what a scene of foolery have I seen,"
12285,"Of sighs, of groans, of sorrow, and of teen!"
12286,"O me, with what strict patience have I sat,"
12287,To see a king transformed to a gnat!
12288,"To see great Hercules whipping a gig,"
12289,"And profound Solomon to tune a jig,"
12290,"And Nestor play at push-pin with the boys,"
12291,And critic Timon laugh at idle toys.
12292,"Where lies thy grief, O, tell me, good Dumaine?"
12293,"And, gentle Longaville, where lies thy pain?"
12294,And where my liege’s? All about the breast?
12295,Too bitter is thy jest.
12296,Are we betrayed thus to thy over-view?
12297,"Not you to me, but I betrayed by you."
12298,"I that am honest, I that hold it sin"
12299,To break the vow I am engaged in.
12300,I am betrayed by keeping company
12301,"With men like you, men of inconstancy."
12302,When shall you see me write a thing in rhyme?
12303,Or groan for Joan? Or spend a minute’s time
12304,In pruning me? When shall you hear that I
12305,"Will praise a hand, a foot, a face, an eye,"
12306,"A gait, a state, a brow, a breast, a waist,"
12307,"A leg, a limb—"
12308,Soft! Whither away so fast?
12309,"A true man, or a thief, that gallops so?"
12310,"I post from love. Good lover, let me go."
12311,"Enter Jaquenetta, with a letter, and Costard."
12312,God bless the King!
12313,What present hast thou there?
12314,What makes treason here?
12315,"Nay, it makes nothing, sir."
12316,"If it mar nothing neither,"
12317,The treason and you go in peace away together.
12318,"I beseech your Grace, let this letter be read."
12319,"Our person misdoubts it; ’twas treason, he said."
12320,"Berowne, read it over."
12321,Where hadst thou it?
12322,Where hadst thou it?
12323,"Of Dun Adramadio, Dun Adramadio."
12324,"How now, what is in you? Why dost thou tear it?"
12325,"A toy, my liege, a toy. Your Grace needs not fear it."
12326,"It did move him to passion, and therefore let’s hear it."
12327,"It is Berowne’s writing, and here is his name."
12328,"Guilty, my lord, guilty. I confess, I confess."
12329,That you three fools lacked me fool to make up the mess.
12330,"He, he, and you—and you, my liege—and I"
12331,"Are pick-purses in love, and we deserve to die."
12332,"O, dismiss this audience, and I shall tell you more."
12333,Now the number is even.
12334,"True, true, we are four."
12335,Will these turtles be gone?
12336,"Walk aside the true folk, and let the traitors stay."
12337,"Sweet lords, sweet lovers, O, let us embrace!"
12338,As true we are as flesh and blood can be.
12339,"The sea will ebb and flow, heaven show his face;"
12340,Young blood doth not obey an old decree.
12341,We cannot cross the cause why we were born;
12342,Therefore of all hands must we be forsworn.
12343,"What, did these rent lines show some love of thine?"
12344,“Did they?” quoth you? Who sees the heavenly Rosaline
12345,"That, like a rude and savage man of Ind,"
12346,"At the first op’ning of the gorgeous east,"
12347,"Bows not his vassal head and, strucken blind,"
12348,Kisses the base ground with obedient breast?
12349,What peremptory eagle-sighted eye
12350,Dares look upon the heaven of her brow
12351,That is not blinded by her majesty?
12352,"What zeal, what fury hath inspired thee now?"
12353,"My love, her mistress, is a gracious moon;"
12354,"She, an attending star, scarce seen a light."
12355,"My eyes are then no eyes, nor I Berowne."
12356,"O, but for my love, day would turn to night!"
12357,Of all complexions the culled sovereignty
12358,"Do meet as at a fair in her fair cheek,"
12359,"Where several worthies make one dignity,"
12360,Where nothing wants that want itself doth seek.
12361,Lend me the flourish of all gentle tongues—
12362,"Fie, painted rhetoric! O, she needs it not."
12363,To things of sale a seller’s praise belongs.
12364,She passes praise; then praise too short doth blot.
12365,"A withered hermit, five-score winters worn,"
12366,"Might shake off fifty, looking in her eye."
12367,"Beauty doth varnish age, as if new born,"
12368,And gives the crutch the cradle’s infancy.
12369,"O, ’tis the sun that maketh all things shine!"
12370,"By heaven, thy love is black as ebony."
12371,Is ebony like her? O word divine!
12372,A wife of such wood were felicity.
12373,"O, who can give an oath? Where is a book?"
12374,That I may swear beauty doth beauty lack
12375,If that she learn not of her eye to look.
12376,No face is fair that is not full so black.
12377,"O paradox! Black is the badge of hell,"
12378,The hue of dungeons and the school of night;
12379,And beauty’s crest becomes the heavens well.
12380,"Devils soonest tempt, resembling spirits of light."
12381,"O, if in black my lady’s brows be decked,"
12382,It mourns that painting and usurping hair
12383,Should ravish doters with a false aspect;
12384,And therefore is she born to make black fair.
12385,"Her favour turns the fashion of the days,"
12386,For native blood is counted painting now;
12387,"And therefore red, that would avoid dispraise,"
12388,"Paints itself black, to imitate her brow."
12389,To look like her are chimney-sweepers black.
12390,And since her time are colliers counted bright.
12391,And Ethiopes of their sweet complexion crack.
12392,"Dark needs no candles now, for dark is light."
12393,"Your mistresses dare never come in rain,"
12394,For fear their colours should be washed away.
12395,"’Twere good yours did; for, sir, to tell you plain,"
12396,I’ll find a fairer face not washed today.
12397,"I’ll prove her fair, or talk till doomsday here."
12398,No devil will fright thee then so much as she.
12399,I never knew man hold vile stuff so dear.
12400,"Look, here’s thy love, my foot and her face see."
12401,"O, if the streets were paved with thine eyes,"
12402,Her feet were much too dainty for such tread.
12403,"O vile! Then, as she goes, what upward lies"
12404,The street should see as she walked over head.
12405,But what of this? Are we not all in love?
12406,"Nothing so sure, and thereby all forsworn."
12407,"Then leave this chat, and, good Berowne, now prove"
12408,"Our loving lawful, and our faith not torn."
12409,"Ay, marry, there; some flattery for this evil."
12410,"O, some authority how to proceed."
12411,"Some tricks, some quillets, how to cheat the devil."
12412,Some salve for perjury.
12413,"O, ’tis more than need."
12414,"Have at you, then, affection’s men-at-arms."
12415,Consider what you first did swear unto:
12416,"To fast, to study, and to see no woman—"
12417,Flat treason ’gainst the kingly state of youth.
12418,"Say, can you fast? Your stomachs are too young,"
12419,And abstinence engenders maladies.
12420,"O, we have made a vow to study, lords,"
12421,And in that vow we have forsworn our books;
12422,"For when would you, my liege, or you, or you,"
12423,In leaden contemplation have found out
12424,Such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes
12425,Of beauty’s tutors have enriched you with?
12426,"Other slow arts entirely keep the brain,"
12427,"And therefore, finding barren practisers,"
12428,Scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil;
12429,"But love, first learned in a lady’s eyes,"
12430,"Lives not alone immured in the brain,"
12431,But with the motion of all elements
12432,"Courses as swift as thought in every power,"
12433,"And gives to every power a double power,"
12434,Above their functions and their offices.
12435,It adds a precious seeing to the eye.
12436,A lover’s eyes will gaze an eagle blind.
12437,"A lover’s ear will hear the lowest sound,"
12438,When the suspicious head of theft is stopped.
12439,Love’s feeling is more soft and sensible
12440,Than are the tender horns of cockled snails.
12441,Love’s tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste.
12442,"For valour, is not Love a Hercules,"
12443,Still climbing trees in the Hesperides?
12444,"Subtle as Sphinx, as sweet and musical"
12445,"As bright Apollo’s lute, strung with his hair."
12446,"And when Love speaks, the voice of all the gods"
12447,Make heaven drowsy with the harmony.
12448,Never durst poet touch a pen to write
12449,Until his ink were tempered with Love’s sighs.
12450,"O, then his lines would ravish savage ears"
12451,And plant in tyrants mild humility.
12452,From women’s eyes this doctrine I derive.
12453,They sparkle still the right Promethean fire;
12454,"They are the books, the arts, the academes,"
12455,"That show, contain, and nourish, all the world;"
12456,Else none at all in aught proves excellent.
12457,"Then fools you were these women to forswear,"
12458,"Or, keeping what is sworn, you will prove fools."
12459,"For wisdom’s sake, a word that all men love,"
12460,"Or for love’s sake, a word that loves all men,"
12461,"Or for men’s sake, the authors of these women,"
12462,"Or women’s sake, by whom we men are men,"
12463,"Let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves,"
12464,Or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths.
12465,"It is religion to be thus forsworn,"
12466,"For charity itself fulfils the law,"
12467,And who can sever love from charity?
12468,"Saint Cupid, then, and, soldiers, to the field!"
12469,"Advance your standards, and upon them, lords!"
12470,"Pell-mell, down with them! But be first advised"
12471,In conflict that you get the sun of them.
12472,Now to plain dealing. Lay these glozes by.
12473,Shall we resolve to woo these girls of France?
12474,And win them too. Therefore let us devise
12475,Some entertainment for them in their tents.
12476,"First, from the park let us conduct them thither."
12477,Then homeward every man attach the hand
12478,Of his fair mistress. In the afternoon
12479,"We will with some strange pastime solace them,"
12480,Such as the shortness of the time can shape;
12481,"For revels, dances, masques, and merry hours"
12482,"Forerun fair Love, strewing her way with flowers."
12483,"Away, away! No time shall be omitted"
12484,That will betime and may by us be fitted.
12485,"_Allons! allons!_ Sowed cockle reaped no corn,"
12486,And justice always whirls in equal measure.
12487,Light wenches may prove plagues to men forsworn;
12488,"If so, our copper buys no better treasure."
12489,SCENE I. The King of Navarre’s park
12490,"Enter Holofernes, Sir Nathaniel and Dull."
12491,"I praise God for you, sir. Your reasons at dinner have been sharp and"
12492,"sententious, pleasant without scurrility, witty without affection,"
12493,"audacious without impudency, learned without opinion, and strange"
12494,without heresy. I did converse this _quondam_ day with a companion of
12495,"the King’s, who is intituled, nominated, or called, Don Adriano de"
12496,"_Novi hominem tanquam te._ His humour is lofty, his discourse"
12497,"peremptory, his tongue filed, his eye ambitious, his gait majestical"
12498,"and his general behaviour vain, ridiculous, and thrasonical. He is too"
12499,"picked, too spruce, too affected, too odd, as it were, too peregrinate,"
12500,as I may call it.
12501,A most singular and choice epithet.
12502,He draweth out the thread of his verbosity finer than the staple of his
12503,"argument. I abhor such fanatical phantasimes, such insociable and"
12504,"point-devise companions, such rackers of orthography, as to speak"
12505,"“dout” _sine_ “b”, when he should say “doubt”, “det” when he should"
12506,"pronounce “debt”—_d, e, b, t_, not _d, e, t_. He clepeth a calf “cauf”,"
12507,"half “hauf”; neighbour _vocatur_ “nebour”, neigh abbreviated “ne”. This"
12508,"is abhominable, which he would call “abominable”. It insinuateth me of"
12509,"insanie. _Ne intelligis, domine?_ To make frantic, lunatic."
12510,"_Laus Deo, bone intelligo._"
12511,_Bone? Bone_ for _bene?_ Priscian a little scratched; ’twill serve.
12512,"Enter Armado, Moth and Costard."
12513,"_Quare_ “chirrah”, not “sirrah”?"
12514,"Men of peace, well encountered."
12515,"Most military sir, salutation."
12516,"O, they have lived long on the almsbasket of words. I marvel thy master"
12517,"hath not eaten thee for a word, for thou art not so long by the head as"
12518,_honorificabilitudinitatibus_. Thou art easier swallowed than a
12519,Peace! The peal begins.
12520,"Yes, yes, he teaches boys the hornbook. What is _a, b_, spelt backward"
12521,with the horn on his head?
12522,"_Ba, pueritia_, with a horn added."
12523,"_Ba_, most silly sheep with a horn. You hear his learning."
12524,"_Quis, quis_, thou consonant?"
12525,"The third of the five vowels, if you repeat them; or the fifth, if I."
12526,"I will repeat them: _a, e, i_—"
12527,"The sheep. The other two concludes it: _o, u_."
12528,"Now, by the salt wave of the Mediterraneum, a sweet touch, a quick"
12529,"venue of wit! Snip, snap, quick and home! It rejoiceth my intellect."
12530,Offered by a child to an old man—which is wit-old.
12531,What is the figure? What is the figure?
12532,Thou disputes like an infant. Go whip thy gig.
12533,"Lend me your horn to make one, and I will whip about your infamy _unum"
12534,cita_. A gig of a cuckold’s horn.
12535,"An I had but one penny in the world, thou shouldst have it to buy"
12536,"gingerbread. Hold, there is the very remuneration I had of thy master,"
12537,"thou halfpenny purse of wit, thou pigeon-egg of discretion. O, an the"
12538,"heavens were so pleased that thou wert but my bastard, what a joyful"
12539,"father wouldst thou make me! Go to, thou hast it _ad dunghill_, at the"
12540,"fingers’ ends, as they say."
12541,"O, I smell false Latin! _Dunghill_ for _unguem_."
12542,"Arts-man, preambulate. We will be singuled from the barbarous. Do you"
12543,not educate youth at the charge-house on the top of the mountain?
12544,"Or _mons_, the hill."
12545,"At your sweet pleasure, for the mountain."
12546,"I do, _sans question_."
12547,"Sir, it is the King’s most sweet pleasure and affection to congratulate"
12548,"the Princess at her pavilion in the posteriors of this day, which the"
12549,rude multitude call the afternoon.
12550,"The posterior of the day, most generous sir, is liable, congruent, and"
12551,"measurable for the afternoon. The word is well culled, chose, sweet,"
12552,"and apt, I do assure you, sir, I do assure."
12553,"Sir, the King is a noble gentleman, and my familiar, I do assure ye,"
12554,"very good friend. For what is inward between us, let it pass. I do"
12555,"beseech thee, remember thy courtesy; I beseech thee, apparel thy head."
12556,"And among other importunate and most serious designs, and of great"
12557,"import indeed, too—but let that pass. For I must tell thee it will"
12558,"please his Grace, by the world, sometime to lean upon my poor shoulder"
12559,"and with his royal finger thus dally with my excrement, with my"
12560,"mustachio. But, sweet heart, let that pass. By the world, I recount no"
12561,fable! Some certain special honours it pleaseth his greatness to impart
12562,"to Armado, a soldier, a man of travel, that hath seen the world. But"
12563,"let that pass. The very all of all is—but, sweet heart, I do implore"
12564,"secrecy—that the King would have me present the Princess, sweet chuck,"
12565,"with some delightful ostentation, or show, or pageant, or antic, or"
12566,"firework. Now, understanding that the curate and your sweet self are"
12567,"good at such eruptions and sudden breaking-out of mirth, as it were, I"
12568,"have acquainted you withal, to the end to crave your assistance."
12569,"Sir, you shall present before her the Nine Worthies. Sir Nathaniel, as"
12570,"concerning some entertainment of time, some show in the posterior of"
12571,"this day, to be rendered by our assistance, the King’s command, and"
12572,"this most gallant, illustrate, and learned gentleman, before the"
12573,"Princess, I say, none so fit as to present the Nine Worthies."
12574,Where will you find men worthy enough to present them?
12575,"Joshua, yourself; myself; and this gallant gentleman, Judas Maccabaeus."
12576,"This swain, because of his great limb or joint, shall pass Pompey the"
12577,"Great; the page, Hercules."
12578,"Pardon, sir; error. He is not quantity enough for that Worthy’s thumb;"
12579,he is not so big as the end of his club.
12580,Shall I have audience? He shall present Hercules in minority. His enter
12581,and exit shall be strangling a snake; and I will have an apology for
12582,"An excellent device! So, if any of the audience hiss, you may cry “Well"
12583,"done, Hercules, now thou crushest the snake!” That is the way to make"
12584,"an offence gracious, though few have the grace to do it."
12585,For the rest of the Worthies?
12586,I will play three myself.
12587,Shall I tell you a thing?
12588,"We will have, if this fadge not, an antic. I beseech you, follow."
12589,"_Via_, goodman Dull! Thou has spoken no word all this while."
12590,"Nor understood none neither, sir."
12591,_Allons!_ we will employ thee.
12592,"I’ll make one in a dance, or so; or I will play on the tabor to the"
12593,"Worthies, and let them dance the hay."
12594,"Most dull, honest Dull! To our sport, away."
12595,SCENE II. The same. Before the Princess’s pavilion
12596,"Enter the Princess, Rosaline, Katharine and Maria."
12597,"Sweet hearts, we shall be rich ere we depart,"
12598,If fairings come thus plentifully in.
12599,A lady walled about with diamonds!
12600,Look you what I have from the loving King.
12601,"Madam, came nothing else along with that?"
12602,"Nothing but this? Yes, as much love in rhyme"
12603,As would be crammed up in a sheet of paper
12604,"Writ o’ both sides the leaf, margent and all,"
12605,That he was fain to seal on Cupid’s name.
12606,"That was the way to make his godhead wax,"
12607,For he hath been five thousand years a boy.
12608,"Ay, and a shrewd unhappy gallows too."
12609,You’ll ne’er be friends with him. He killed your sister.
12610,"He made her melancholy, sad, and heavy;"
12611,"And so she died. Had she been light, like you,"
12612,"Of such a merry, nimble, stirring spirit,"
12613,She might ha’ been a grandam ere she died.
12614,"And so may you, for a light heart lives long."
12615,"What’s your dark meaning, mouse, of this light word?"
12616,A light condition in a beauty dark.
12617,We need more light to find your meaning out.
12618,You’ll mar the light by taking it in snuff;
12619,Therefore I’ll darkly end the argument.
12620,"Look what you do, you do it still i’ th’ dark."
12621,"So do not you, for you are a light wench."
12622,"Indeed, I weigh not you, and therefore light."
12623,"You weigh me not? O, that’s you care not for me."
12624,"Great reason, for past cure is still past care."
12625,Well bandied both; a set of wit well played.
12626,"But, Rosaline, you have a favour too."
12627,Who sent it? And what is it?
12628,I would you knew.
12629,"An if my face were but as fair as yours,"
12630,My favour were as great. Be witness this.
12631,"Nay, I have verses too, I thank Berowne;"
12632,"The numbers true, and, were the numbering too,"
12633,I were the fairest goddess on the ground.
12634,I am compared to twenty thousand fairs.
12635,"O, he hath drawn my picture in his letter."
12636,"Much in the letters, nothing in the praise."
12637,Beauteous as ink: a good conclusion.
12638,Fair as a text B in a copy-book.
12639,"’Ware pencils, how! Let me not die your debtor,"
12640,"My red dominical, my golden letter."
12641,"O, that your face were not so full of O’s!"
12642,A pox of that jest! And beshrew all shrews.
12643,"But, Katharine, what was sent to you from fair Dumaine?"
12644,Did he not send you twain?
12645,"Yes, madam, and moreover,"
12646,Some thousand verses of a faithful lover.
12647,"A huge translation of hypocrisy,"
12648,"Vilely compiled, profound simplicity."
12649,"This, and these pearls, to me sent Longaville."
12650,The letter is too long by half a mile.
12651,I think no less. Dost thou not wish in heart
12652,The chain were longer and the letter short?
12653,"Ay, or I would these hands might never part."
12654,We are wise girls to mock our lovers so.
12655,They are worse fools to purchase mocking so.
12656,That same Berowne I’ll torture ere I go.
12657,O that I knew he were but in by th’ week!
12658,"How I would make him fawn, and beg, and seek,"
12659,"And wait the season, and observe the times,"
12660,"And spend his prodigal wits in bootless rhymes,"
12661,"And shape his service wholly to my hests,"
12662,And make him proud to make me proud that jests!
12663,"So pair-taunt-like would I o’ersway his state,"
12664,"That he should be my fool, and I his fate."
12665,"None are so surely caught, when they are catched,"
12666,"As wit turned fool. Folly, in wisdom hatched,"
12667,Hath wisdom’s warrant and the help of school
12668,And wit’s own grace to grace a learned fool.
12669,The blood of youth burns not with such excess
12670,As gravity’s revolt to wantonness.
12671,Folly in fools bears not so strong a note
12672,"As fool’ry in the wise when wit doth dote,"
12673,Since all the power thereof it doth apply
12674,"To prove, by wit, worth in simplicity."
12675,"Here comes Boyet, and mirth is in his face."
12676,"O, I am stabbed with laughter! Where’s her Grace?"
12677,"Arm, wenches, arm! Encounters mounted are"
12678,"Against your peace. Love doth approach disguised,"
12679,Armed in arguments. You’ll be surprised.
12680,"Muster your wits, stand in your own defence,"
12681,"Or hide your heads like cowards, and fly hence."
12682,Saint Denis to Saint Cupid! What are they
12683,"That charge their breath against us? Say, scout, say."
12684,Under the cool shade of a sycamore
12685,"I thought to close mine eyes some half an hour,"
12686,"When, lo, to interrupt my purposed rest,"
12687,Toward that shade I might behold addressed
12688,The King and his companions. Warily
12689,"I stole into a neighbour thicket by,"
12690,And overheard what you shall overhear:
12691,"That, by and by, disguised they will be here."
12692,Their herald is a pretty knavish page
12693,That well by heart hath conned his embassage.
12694,Action and accent did they teach him there:
12695,"“Thus must thou speak,” and “thus thy body bear.”"
12696,And ever and anon they made a doubt
12697,Presence majestical would put him out;
12698,"“For,” quoth the King, “an angel shalt thou see;"
12699,"Yet fear not thou, but speak audaciously.”"
12700,The boy replied “An angel is not evil;
12701,I should have feared her had she been a devil.”
12702,"With that all laughed and clapped him on the shoulder,"
12703,Making the bold wag by their praises bolder.
12704,"One rubbed his elbow thus, and fleered, and swore"
12705,A better speech was never spoke before.
12706,Another with his finger and his thumb
12707,"Cried “_Via_, we will do ’t, come what will come.”"
12708,"The third he capered, and cried “All goes well!”"
12709,"The fourth turned on the toe, and down he fell."
12710,"With that they all did tumble on the ground,"
12711,"With such a zealous laughter, so profound,"
12712,"That in this spleen ridiculous appears,"
12713,"To check their folly, passion’s solemn tears."
12714,"But what, but what, come they to visit us?"
12715,"They do, they do, and are apparelled thus,"
12716,"Like Muscovites, or Russians, as I guess."
12717,"Their purpose is to parley, court, and dance,"
12718,And every one his love-feat will advance
12719,"Unto his several mistress, which they’ll know"
12720,By favours several which they did bestow.
12721,And will they so? The gallants shall be tasked;
12722,"For, ladies, we will every one be masked,"
12723,"And not a man of them shall have the grace,"
12724,"Despite of suit, to see a lady’s face."
12725,"Hold, Rosaline, this favour thou shalt wear,"
12726,And then the King will court thee for his dear.
12727,"Hold, take thou this, my sweet, and give me thine,"
12728,So shall Berowne take me for Rosaline.
12729,And change you favours too; so shall your loves
12730,"Woo contrary, deceived by these removes."
12731,"Come on, then, wear the favours most in sight."
12732,"But in this changing, what is your intent?"
12733,The effect of my intent is to cross theirs.
12734,"They do it but in mocking merriment,"
12735,And mock for mock is only my intent.
12736,Their several counsels they unbosom shall
12737,"To loves mistook, and so be mocked withal"
12738,"Upon the next occasion that we meet,"
12739,With visages displayed to talk and greet.
12740,"But shall we dance, if they desire us to’t?"
12741,"No, to the death we will not move a foot,"
12742,"Nor to their penned speech render we no grace,"
12743,But while ’tis spoke each turn away her face.
12744,"Why, that contempt will kill the speaker’s heart,"
12745,And quite divorce his memory from his part.
12746,"Therefore I do it, and I make no doubt"
12747,"The rest will ne’er come in, if he be out."
12748,"There’s no such sport as sport by sport o’erthrown,"
12749,To make theirs ours and ours none but our own.
12750,"So shall we stay, mocking intended game,"
12751,"And they, well mocked, depart away with shame."
12752,The trumpet sounds. Be masked; the maskers come.
12753,"Enter Blackamoors with music, Moth, with a speech, the King, Berowne,"
12754,Longaville and Dumaine disguised.
12755,"_All hail, the richest beauties on the earth!_"
12756,Beauties no richer than rich taffeta.
12757,_A holy parcel of the fairest dames_
12758,_That ever turned their_—backs—_to mortal views!_
12759,"_Their eyes_, villain, _their eyes._"
12760,_That ever turned their eyes to mortal views.
12761,"_Out of your favours, heavenly spirits, vouchsafe"
12762,"_Once to behold_, rogue!"
12763,_Once to behold with your sun-beamed eyes—
12764,With your sun-beamed eyes_—
12765,They will not answer to that epithet.
12766,You were best call it “daughter-beamed eyes”.
12767,"They do not mark me, and that brings me out."
12768,"Is this your perfectness? Be gone, you rogue!"
12769,"What would these strangers? Know their minds, Boyet."
12770,"If they do speak our language, ’tis our will"
12771,That some plain man recount their purposes.
12772,Know what they would.
12773,What would you with the Princess?
12774,Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.
12775,"What would they, say they?"
12776,Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.
12777,"Why, that they have, and bid them so be gone."
12778,"She says you have it, and you may be gone."
12779,Say to her we have measured many miles
12780,To tread a measure with her on this grass.
12781,They say that they have measured many a mile
12782,To tread a measure with you on this grass.
12783,It is not so. Ask them how many inches
12784,"Is in one mile? If they have measured many,"
12785,The measure then of one is easily told.
12786,"If to come hither you have measured miles,"
12787,"And many miles, the Princess bids you tell"
12788,How many inches doth fill up one mile.
12789,Tell her we measure them by weary steps.
12790,How many weary steps
12791,Of many weary miles you have o’ergone
12792,Are numbered in the travel of one mile?
12793,We number nothing that we spend for you.
12794,"Our duty is so rich, so infinite,"
12795,That we may do it still without account.
12796,"Vouchsafe to show the sunshine of your face,"
12797,"That we, like savages, may worship it."
12798,"My face is but a moon, and clouded too."
12799,"Blessed are clouds, to do as such clouds do!"
12800,"Vouchsafe, bright moon, and these thy stars, to shine,"
12801,"Those clouds removed, upon our watery eyne."
12802,O vain petitioner! Beg a greater matter!
12803,Thou now requests but moonshine in the water.
12804,Then in our measure do but vouchsafe one change.
12805,Thou bidd’st me beg; this begging is not strange.
12806,"Play, music, then! Nay, you must do it soon."
12807,Not yet? No dance! Thus change I like the moon.
12808,Will you not dance? How come you thus estranged?
12809,"You took the moon at full, but now she’s changed."
12810,"Yet still she is the moon, and I the man."
12811,"The music plays, vouchsafe some motion to it."
12812,Our ears vouchsafe it.
12813,But your legs should do it.
12814,"Since you are strangers and come here by chance,"
12815,We’ll not be nice. Take hands. We will not dance.
12816,Why take we hands then?
12817,Only to part friends.
12818,"Curtsy, sweet hearts, and so the measure ends."
12819,More measure of this measure! Be not nice.
12820,We can afford no more at such a price.
12821,Price you yourselves? What buys your company?
12822,That can never be.
12823,Then cannot we be bought. And so adieu—
12824,"Twice to your visor, and half once to you!"
12825,"If you deny to dance, let’s hold more chat."
12826,I am best pleased with that.
12827,"White-handed mistress, one sweet word with thee."
12828,"Honey, and milk, and sugar: there is three."
12829,"Nay, then, two treys, an if you grow so nice,"
12830,"Metheglin, wort, and malmsey. Well run, dice!"
12831,There’s half a dozen sweets.
12832,"Since you can cog, I’ll play no more with you."
12833,One word in secret.
12834,Let it not be sweet.
12835,Thou griev’st my gall.
12836,Will you vouchsafe with me to change a word?
12837,Say you so? Fair lord!
12838,Take that for your “fair lady”.
12839,"As much in private, and I’ll bid adieu."
12840,"What, was your visor made without a tongue?"
12841,"I know the reason, lady, why you ask."
12842,"O, for your reason! Quickly, sir, I long."
12843,"You have a double tongue within your mask,"
12844,And would afford my speechless visor half.
12845,"“Veal”, quoth the Dutchman. Is not veal a calf?"
12846,"A calf, fair lady?"
12847,"No, a fair lord calf."
12848,Let’s part the word.
12849,"No, I’ll not be your half."
12850,Take all and wean it; it may prove an ox.
12851,Look how you butt yourself in these sharp mocks.
12852,"Will you give horns, chaste lady? Do not so."
12853,Then die a calf before your horns do grow.
12854,One word in private with you ere I die.
12855,"Bleat softly, then; the butcher hears you cry."
12856,The tongues of mocking wenches are as keen
12857,"As is the razor’s edge invisible,"
12858,Cutting a smaller hair than may be seen;
12859,"Above the sense of sense, so sensible"
12860,Seemeth their conference. Their conceits have wings
12861,"Fleeter than arrows, bullets, wind, thought, swifter things."
12862,"Not one word more, my maids; break off, break off."
12863,"By heaven, all dry-beaten with pure scoff!"
12864,"Farewell, mad wenches. You have simple wits."
12865,"Twenty adieus, my frozen Muscovites."
12866,Are these the breed of wits so wondered at?
12867,"Tapers they are, with your sweet breaths puffed out."
12868,"Well-liking wits they have; gross, gross; fat, fat."
12869,"O poverty in wit, kingly-poor flout!"
12870,"Will they not, think you, hang themselves tonight?"
12871,Or ever but in vizors show their faces?
12872,This pert Berowne was out of countenance quite.
12873,They were all in lamentable cases.
12874,The King was weeping-ripe for a good word.
12875,Berowne did swear himself out of all suit.
12876,"Dumaine was at my service, and his sword."
12877,"“_Non point_,” quoth I; my servant straight was mute."
12878,Lord Longaville said I came o’er his heart;
12879,And trow you what he called me?
12880,"Yes, in good faith."
12881,"Go, sickness as thou art!"
12882,"Well, better wits have worn plain statute-caps."
12883,But will you hear? The King is my love sworn.
12884,And quick Berowne hath plighted faith to me.
12885,And Longaville was for my service born.
12886,Dumaine is mine as sure as bark on tree.
12887,"Madam, and pretty mistresses, give ear."
12888,Immediately they will again be here
12889,"In their own shapes, for it can never be"
12890,They will digest this harsh indignity.
12891,"They will, they will, God knows,"
12892,"And leap for joy, though they are lame with blows."
12893,"Therefore, change favours and, when they repair,"
12894,Blow like sweet roses in this summer air.
12895,How “blow”? How “blow”? Speak to be understood.
12896,Fair ladies masked are roses in their bud.
12897,"Dismasked, their damask sweet commixture shown,"
12898,"Are angels vailing clouds, or roses blown."
12899,"Avaunt, perplexity! What shall we do"
12900,If they return in their own shapes to woo?
12901,"Good madam, if by me you’ll be advised,"
12902,"Let’s mock them still, as well known as disguised."
12903,"Let us complain to them what fools were here,"
12904,Disguised like Muscovites in shapeless gear;
12905,"And wonder what they were, and to what end"
12906,"Their shallow shows and prologue vilely penned,"
12907,"And their rough carriage so ridiculous,"
12908,Should be presented at our tent to us.
12909,"Ladies, withdraw. The gallants are at hand."
12910,"Whip to our tents, as roes run o’er the land."
12911,"Enter the King, Berowne, Longaville and Dumaine as themselves."
12912,"Fair sir, God save you. Where’s the Princess?"
12913,Gone to her tent. Please it your Majesty
12914,Command me any service to her thither?
12915,That she vouchsafe me audience for one word.
12916,"I will; and so will she, I know, my lord."
12917,This fellow pecks up wit as pigeons peas
12918,And utters it again when God doth please.
12919,"He is wit’s pedlar, and retails his wares"
12920,"At wakes and wassails, meetings, markets, fairs;"
12921,"And we that sell by gross, the Lord doth know,"
12922,Have not the grace to grace it with such show.
12923,This gallant pins the wenches on his sleeve.
12924,"Had he been Adam, he had tempted Eve."
12925,"He can carve too, and lisp. Why, this is he"
12926,That kissed his hand away in courtesy.
12927,"This is the ape of form, Monsieur the Nice,"
12928,"That, when he plays at tables, chides the dice"
12929,"In honourable terms. Nay, he can sing"
12930,A mean most meanly; and in ushering
12931,Mend him who can. The ladies call him sweet.
12932,"The stairs, as he treads on them, kiss his feet."
12933,"This is the flower that smiles on everyone,"
12934,To show his teeth as white as whale’s bone;
12935,And consciences that will not die in debt
12936,Pay him the due of “honey-tongued Boyet”.
12937,"A blister on his sweet tongue, with my heart,"
12938,That put Armado’s page out of his part!
12939,"Enter the Princess, Rosaline, Maria, Katharine with Boyet."
12940,"See where it comes! Behaviour, what wert thou"
12941,"Till this man showed thee, and what art thou now?"
12942,"All hail, sweet madam, and fair time of day."
12943,"“Fair” in “all hail” is foul, as I conceive."
12944,"Construe my speeches better, if you may."
12945,Then wish me better. I will give you leave.
12946,"We came to visit you, and purpose now"
12947,To lead you to our court. Vouchsafe it then.
12948,"This field shall hold me, and so hold your vow."
12949,Nor God nor I delights in perjured men.
12950,Rebuke me not for that which you provoke.
12951,The virtue of your eye must break my oath.
12952,You nickname virtue: “vice” you should have spoke;
12953,For virtue’s office never breaks men’s troth.
12954,"Now by my maiden honour, yet as pure"
12955,"As the unsullied lily, I protest,"
12956,"A world of torments though I should endure,"
12957,"I would not yield to be your house’s guest,"
12958,So much I hate a breaking cause to be
12959,"Of heavenly oaths, vowed with integrity."
12960,"O, you have lived in desolation here,"
12961,"Unseen, unvisited, much to our shame."
12962,"Not so, my lord. It is not so, I swear."
12963,We have had pastimes here and pleasant game.
12964,A mess of Russians left us but of late.
12965,"Ay, in truth, my lord."
12966,"Trim gallants, full of courtship and of state."
12967,"Madam, speak true. It is not so, my lord."
12968,"My lady, to the manner of the days,"
12969,In courtesy gives undeserving praise.
12970,We four indeed confronted were with four
12971,In Russian habit. Here they stayed an hour
12972,"And talked apace; and in that hour, my lord,"
12973,They did not bless us with one happy word.
12974,"I dare not call them fools; but this I think,"
12975,"When they are thirsty, fools would fain have drink."
12976,"This jest is dry to me. My gentle sweet,"
12977,"Your wit makes wise things foolish. When we greet,"
12978,"With eyes’ best seeing, heaven’s fiery eye,"
12979,By light we lose light. Your capacity
12980,Is of that nature that to your huge store
12981,Wise things seem foolish and rich things but poor.
12982,"This proves you wise and rich, for in my eye—"
12983,"I am a fool, and full of poverty."
12984,"But that you take what doth to you belong,"
12985,It were a fault to snatch words from my tongue.
12986,"O, I am yours, and all that I possess."
12987,All the fool mine?
12988,I cannot give you less.
12989,Which of the visors was it that you wore?
12990,"Where, when, what visor? Why demand you this?"
12991,"There, then, that visor; that superfluous case"
12992,That hid the worse and showed the better face.
12993,We are descried. They’ll mock us now downright.
12994,Let us confess and turn it to a jest.
12995,"Amazed, my lord? Why looks your Highness sad?"
12996,Help! Hold his brows! He’ll swoon. Why look you pale?
12997,"Seasick, I think, coming from Muscovy."
12998,Thus pour the stars down plagues for perjury.
12999,Can any face of brass hold longer out?
13000,"Here stand I, lady; dart thy skill at me."
13001,"Bruise me with scorn, confound me with a flout,"
13002,"Thrust thy sharp wit quite through my ignorance,"
13003,"Cut me to pieces with thy keen conceit,"
13004,"And I will wish thee never more to dance,"
13005,Nor never more in Russian habit wait.
13006,"O, never will I trust to speeches penned,"
13007,"Nor to the motion of a school-boy’s tongue,"
13008,"Nor never come in visor to my friend,"
13009,Nor woo in rhyme like a blind harper’s song.
13010,"Taffeta phrases, silken terms precise,"
13011,"Three-piled hyperboles, spruce affectation,"
13012,Figures pedantical: these summer flies
13013,Have blown me full of maggot ostentation.
13014,"I do forswear them, and I here protest,"
13015,"By this white glove—how white the hand, God knows!—"
13016,Henceforth my wooing mind shall be expressed
13017,In russet yeas and honest kersey noes.
13018,"And, to begin: wench, so God help me, law,"
13019,"My love to thee is sound, _sans_ crack or flaw."
13020,"_Sans_ “_sans_,” I pray you."
13021,Yet I have a trick
13022,"Of the old rage. Bear with me, I am sick;"
13023,"I’ll leave it by degrees. Soft, let us see:"
13024,Write “Lord have mercy on us” on those three.
13025,They are infected; in their hearts it lies;
13026,"They have the plague, and caught it of your eyes."
13027,"These lords are visited. You are not free,"
13028,For the Lord’s tokens on you do I see.
13029,"No, they are free that gave these tokens to us."
13030,Our states are forfeit. Seek not to undo us.
13031,"It is not so. For how can this be true,"
13032,"That you stand forfeit, being those that sue?"
13033,Peace! for I will not have to do with you.
13034,"Nor shall not, if I do as I intend."
13035,Speak for yourselves. My wit is at an end.
13036,"Teach us, sweet madam, for our rude transgression"
13037,The fairest is confession.
13038,"Were not you here but even now, disguised?"
13039,And were you well advised?
13040,"I was, fair madam."
13041,"When you then were here,"
13042,What did you whisper in your lady’s ear?
13043,That more than all the world I did respect her.
13044,"When she shall challenge this, you will reject her."
13045,"Upon mine honour, no."
13046,"Your oath once broke, you force not to forswear."
13047,Despise me when I break this oath of mine.
13048,"I will; and therefore keep it. Rosaline,"
13049,What did the Russian whisper in your ear?
13050,"Madam, he swore that he did hold me dear"
13051,"As precious eyesight, and did value me"
13052,"Above this world; adding thereto, moreover,"
13053,"That he would wed me, or else die my lover."
13054,God give thee joy of him! The noble lord
13055,Most honourably doth uphold his word.
13056,"What mean you, madam? By my life, my troth,"
13057,I never swore this lady such an oath.
13058,"By heaven, you did! And to confirm it plain,"
13059,"You gave me this. But take it, sir, again."
13060,My faith and this the Princess I did give.
13061,I knew her by this jewel on her sleeve.
13062,"Pardon me, sir, this jewel did she wear,"
13063,"And Lord Berowne, I thank him, is my dear."
13064,"What, will you have me, or your pearl again?"
13065,Neither of either; I remit both twain.
13066,"I see the trick on’t. Here was a consent,"
13067,"Knowing aforehand of our merriment,"
13068,To dash it like a Christmas comedy.
13069,"Some carry-tale, some please-man, some slight zany,"
13070,"Some mumble-news, some trencher-knight, some Dick,"
13071,That smiles his cheek in years and knows the trick
13072,"To make my lady laugh when she’s disposed,"
13073,"Told our intents before; which once disclosed,"
13074,"The ladies did change favours, and then we,"
13075,"Following the signs, wooed but the sign of she."
13076,"Now, to our perjury to add more terror,"
13077,We are again forsworn in will and error.
13078,Much upon this ’tis. [_To Boyet_.] And might not you
13079,"Forestall our sport, to make us thus untrue?"
13080,"Do not you know my lady’s foot by th’ squier,"
13081,And laugh upon the apple of her eye?
13082,"And stand between her back, sir, and the fire,"
13083,"Holding a trencher, jesting merrily?"
13084,"You put our page out. Go, you are allowed;"
13085,"Die when you will, a smock shall be your shroud."
13086,"You leer upon me, do you? There’s an eye"
13087,Wounds like a leaden sword.
13088,"Hath this brave manage, this career, been run."
13089,"Lo, he is tilting straight! Peace! I have done."
13090,"Welcome, pure wit! Thou part’st a fair fray."
13091,"O Lord, sir, they would know"
13092,Whether the three Worthies shall come in or no.
13093,"What, are there but three?"
13094,"No, sir; but it is vara fine,"
13095,For every one pursents three.
13096,And three times thrice is nine.
13097,"Not so, sir, under correction, sir, I hope it is not so."
13098,"You cannot beg us, sir, I can assure you, sir; we know what we know."
13099,"I hope, sir, three times thrice, sir—"
13100,"Under correction, sir, we know whereuntil it doth amount."
13101,"By Jove, I always took three threes for nine."
13102,"O Lord, sir, it were pity you should get your living by reckoning, sir."
13103,How much is it?
13104,"O Lord, sir, the parties themselves, the actors, sir, will show"
13105,"whereuntil it doth amount. For mine own part, I am, as they say, but to"
13106,"parfect one man in one poor man—Pompion the Great, sir."
13107,Art thou one of the Worthies?
13108,It pleased them to think me worthy of Pompey the Great. For mine own
13109,"part, I know not the degree of the Worthy, but I am to stand for him."
13110,Go bid them prepare.
13111,"We will turn it finely off, sir; we will take some care."
13112,"Berowne, they will shame us. Let them not approach."
13113,"We are shame-proof, my lord, and ’tis some policy"
13114,To have one show worse than the King’s and his company.
13115,I say they shall not come.
13116,"Nay, my good lord, let me o’errule you now."
13117,"That sport best pleases that doth least know how,"
13118,"Where zeal strives to content, and the contents"
13119,Die in the zeal of that which it presents;
13120,"Their form confounded makes most form in mirth,"
13121,When great things labouring perish in their birth.
13122,"A right description of our sport, my lord."
13123,"Enter Armado, the Braggart."
13124,"Anointed, I implore so much expense of thy royal sweet breath as will"
13125,utter a brace of words.
13126,Doth this man serve God?
13127,He speaks not like a man of God his making.
13128,"That is all one, my fair, sweet, honey monarch; for, I protest, the"
13129,"schoolmaster is exceeding fantastical; too, too vain, too, too vain."
13130,"But we will put it, as they say, to _fortuna de la guerra_. I wish you"
13131,"the peace of mind, most royal couplement!"
13132,Here is like to be a good presence of Worthies. He presents Hector of
13133,"Troy; the swain, Pompey the Great; the parish curate, Alexander;"
13134,"Armado’s page, Hercules; the pedant, Judas Maccabaeus."
13135,"_And if these four Worthies in their first show thrive,"
13136,These four will change habits and present the other five._
13137,There is five in the first show.
13138,You are deceived. ’Tis not so.
13139,"The pedant, the braggart, the hedge-priest, the fool, and the boy."
13140,"Abate throw at novum, and the whole world again"
13141,"Cannot pick out five such, take each one in his vein."
13142,"The ship is under sail, and here she comes amain."
13143,Enter Costard as Pompey.
13144,"You lie, you are not he."
13145,With leopard’s head on knee.
13146,"Well said, old mocker. I must needs be friends with thee."
13147,"_I Pompey am, Pompey surnamed the Big._"
13148,"It is “Great”, sir; _Pompey surnamed the Great,"
13149,"That oft in field, with targe and shield, did make my foe to sweat."
13150,"And travelling along this coast, I here am come by chance,"
13151,And lay my arms before the legs of this sweet lass of France._
13152,"If your ladyship would say, “Thanks, Pompey”, I had done."
13153,"Great thanks, great Pompey."
13154,’Tis not so much worth; but I hope I was perfect. I made a little fault
13155,"My hat to a halfpenny, Pompey proves the best Worthy."
13156,"Enter Nathaniel, the Curate, for Alexander."
13157,"_When in the world I lived, I was the world’s commander;"
13158,"By east, west, north, and south, I spread my conquering might."
13159,My scutcheon plain declares that I am Alisander._
13160,"Your nose says, no, you are not; for it stands to right."
13161,"Your nose smells “no” in this, most tender-smelling knight."
13162,"The conqueror is dismayed. Proceed, good Alexander."
13163,"_When in the world I lived, I was the world’s commander_—"
13164,"Most true; ’tis right. You were so, Alisander."
13165,"Your servant, and Costard."
13166,"Take away the conqueror, take away Alisander."
13167,Conqueror. You will be scraped out of the painted cloth for this. Your
13168,"lion, that holds his pole-axe sitting on a close-stool, will be given"
13169,"to Ajax. He will be the ninth Worthy. A conqueror, and afeard to speak?"
13170,"Run away for shame, Alisander. [_Nathaniel retires_.] There, an’t shall"
13171,"please you, a foolish mild man; an honest man, look you, and soon"
13172,"dashed. He is a marvellous good neighbour, faith, and a very good"
13173,"bowler; but for Alisander, alas you see how ’tis—a little o’erparted."
13174,But there are Worthies a-coming will speak their mind in some other
13175,"Stand aside, good Pompey."
13176,"Enter Holofernes, the Pedant, as Judas, and Moth, the Boy, as Hercules."
13177,"_Great Hercules is presented by this imp,"
13178,"Whose club killed Cerberus, that three-headed_ canus,"
13179,"_And when he was a babe, a child, a shrimp,"
13180,Thus did he strangle serpents in his_ manus.
13181,"Quoniam _he seemeth in minority_,"
13182,Ergo _I come with this apology._
13183,"Keep some state in thy exit, and vanish."
13184,"_Judas I am, ycleped Maccabaeus._"
13185,Judas Maccabaeus clipped is plain Judas.
13186,A kissing traitor. How art thou proved Judas?
13187,"The more shame for you, Judas."
13188,"What mean you, sir?"
13189,To make Judas hang himself.
13190,"Begin, sir; you are my elder."
13191,Well followed. Judas was hanged on an elder.
13192,I will not be put out of countenance.
13193,Because thou hast no face.
13194,The head of a bodkin.
13195,A death’s face in a ring.
13196,"The face of an old Roman coin, scarce seen."
13197,The pommel of Caesar’s falchion.
13198,The carved-bone face on a flask.
13199,Saint George’s half-cheek in a brooch.
13200,"Ay, and in a brooch of lead."
13201,"Ay, and worn in the cap of a tooth-drawer."
13202,"And now forward, for we have put thee in countenance."
13203,You have put me out of countenance.
13204,False. We have given thee faces.
13205,But you have outfaced them all.
13206,"An thou wert a lion, we would do so."
13207,"Therefore, as he is an ass, let him go."
13208,"And so adieu, sweet Jude. Nay, why dost thou stay?"
13209,For the latter end of his name.
13210,"For the ass to the Jude? Give it him. Jud-as, away!"
13211,"This is not generous, not gentle, not humble."
13212,A light for Monsieur Judas! It grows dark; he may stumble.
13213,"Alas, poor Maccabaeus, how hath he been baited!"
13214,"Enter Armado, the Braggart, as Hector."
13215,"Hide thy head, Achilles. Here comes Hector in arms."
13216,"Though my mocks come home by me, I will now be merry."
13217,Hector was but a Trojan in respect of this.
13218,But is this Hector?
13219,I think Hector was not so clean-timbered.
13220,His leg is too big for Hector’s.
13221,"No, he is best endued in the small."
13222,This cannot be Hector.
13223,"He’s a god or a painter, for he makes faces."
13224,"_The armipotent Mars, of lances the almighty,"
13225,Gave Hector a gift_—
13226,"_The armipotent Mars, of lances the almighty,"
13227,"Gave Hector a gift, the heir of Ilion;"
13228,"A man so breathed that certain he would fight, yea,"
13229,"From morn till night, out of his pavilion."
13230,I am that flower_—
13231,"Sweet Lord Longaville, rein thy tongue."
13232,"I must rather give it the rein, for it runs against Hector."
13233,"Ay, and Hector’s a greyhound."
13234,"The sweet war-man is dead and rotten. Sweet chucks, beat not the bones"
13235,"of the buried. When he breathed, he was a man. But I will forward with"
13236,"my device. [_To the Princess_.] Sweet royalty, bestow on me the sense"
13237,"Speak, brave Hector; we are much delighted."
13238,I do adore thy sweet Grace’s slipper.
13239,Loves her by the foot.
13240,He may not by the yard.
13241,_This Hector far surmounted Hannibal.
13242,The party is gone_—
13243,"Fellow Hector, she is gone; she is two months on her way."
13244,"Faith, unless you play the honest Trojan, the poor wench is cast away."
13245,She’s quick; the child brags in her belly already. ’Tis yours.
13246,Dost thou infamonize me among potentates? Thou shalt die.
13247,"Then shall Hector be whipped for Jaquenetta that is quick by him, and"
13248,hanged for Pompey that is dead by him.
13249,"Greater than  “Great”! Great, great, great Pompey! Pompey the Huge!"
13250,"Pompey is moved. More Ates, more Ates! Stir them on, stir them on!"
13251,Hector will challenge him.
13252,"Ay, if he have no more man’s blood in his belly than will sup a flea."
13253,"By the north pole, I do challenge thee."
13254,"I will not fight with a pole, like a northern man. I’ll slash, I’ll do"
13255,"it by the sword. I bepray you, let me borrow my arms again."
13256,Room for the incensed Worthies!
13257,I’ll do it in my shirt.
13258,"Master, let me take you a buttonhole lower. Do you not see Pompey is"
13259,uncasing for the combat? What mean you? You will lose your reputation.
13260,"Gentlemen and soldiers, pardon me. I will not combat in my shirt."
13261,You may not deny it. Pompey hath made the challenge.
13262,"Sweet bloods, I both may and will."
13263,What reason have you for ’t?
13264,"The naked truth of it is, I have no shirt. I go woolward for penance."
13265,"True, and it was enjoined him in Rome for want of linen; since when,"
13266,"I’ll be sworn, he wore none but a dishclout of Jaquenetta’s, and that"
13267,he wears next his heart for a favour.
13268,"Enter a Messenger, Monsieur Marcadé."
13269,"God save you, madam."
13270,But that thou interruptest our merriment.
13271,"I am sorry, madam, for the news I bring"
13272,Is heavy in my tongue. The King your father—
13273,"Dead, for my life!"
13274,Even so. My tale is told.
13275,Worthies away! The scene begins to cloud.
13276,"For mine own part, I breathe free breath. I have seen the day of wrong"
13277,"through the little hole of discretion, and I will right myself like a"
13278,How fares your Majesty?
13279,"Boyet, prepare. I will away tonight."
13280,"Madam, not so. I do beseech you stay."
13281,"Prepare, I say. I thank you, gracious lords,"
13282,"For all your fair endeavours, and entreat,"
13283,"Out of a new-sad soul, that you vouchsafe"
13284,In your rich wisdom to excuse or hide
13285,"The liberal opposition of our spirits,"
13286,If over-boldly we have borne ourselves
13287,In the converse of breath; your gentleness
13288,"Was guilty of it. Farewell, worthy lord!"
13289,A heavy heart bears not a nimble tongue.
13290,"Excuse me so, coming too short of thanks"
13291,For my great suit so easily obtained.
13292,The extreme parts of time extremely forms
13293,"All causes to the purpose of his speed,"
13294,And often at his very loose decides
13295,That which long process could not arbitrate.
13296,And though the mourning brow of progeny
13297,Forbid the smiling courtesy of love
13298,"The holy suit which fain it would convince,"
13299,"Yet, since love’s argument was first on foot,"
13300,Let not the cloud of sorrow jostle it
13301,From what it purposed; since to wail friends lost
13302,Is not by much so wholesome-profitable
13303,As to rejoice at friends but newly found.
13304,I understand you not. My griefs are double.
13305,Honest plain words best pierce the ear of grief;
13306,And by these badges understand the King.
13307,"For your fair sakes have we neglected time,"
13308,"Played foul play with our oaths. Your beauty, ladies,"
13309,"Hath much deformed us, fashioning our humours"
13310,Even to the opposed end of our intents;
13311,And what in us hath seemed ridiculous—
13312,"As love is full of unbefitting strains,"
13313,"All wanton as a child, skipping and vain,"
13314,"Formed by the eye and therefore, like the eye,"
13315,"Full of strange shapes, of habits and of forms,"
13316,Varying in subjects as the eye doth roll
13317,To every varied object in his glance;
13318,Which parti-coated presence of loose love
13319,"Put on by us, if, in your heavenly eyes,"
13320,"Have misbecomed our oaths and gravities,"
13321,Those heavenly eyes that look into these faults
13322,"Suggested us to make. Therefore, ladies,"
13323,"Our love being yours, the error that love makes"
13324,Is likewise yours. We to ourselves prove false
13325,By being once false for ever to be true
13326,"To those that make us both—fair ladies, you."
13327,"And even that falsehood, in itself a sin,"
13328,Thus purifies itself and turns to grace.
13329,"We have received your letters, full of love;"
13330,"Your favours, the ambassadors of love;"
13331,And in our maiden council rated them
13332,"At courtship, pleasant jest, and courtesy,"
13333,As bombast and as lining to the time.
13334,But more devout than this in our respects
13335,Have we not been; and therefore met your loves
13336,"In their own fashion, like a merriment."
13337,"Our letters, madam, showed much more than jest."
13338,So did our looks.
13339,We did not quote them so.
13340,"Now, at the latest minute of the hour,"
13341,Grant us your loves.
13342,"A time, methinks, too short"
13343,To make a world-without-end bargain in.
13344,"No, no, my lord, your Grace is perjured much,"
13345,Full of dear guiltiness; and therefore this:
13346,If for my love—as there is no such cause—
13347,"You will do aught, this shall you do for me:"
13348,"Your oath I will not trust, but go with speed"
13349,"To some forlorn and naked hermitage,"
13350,"Remote from all the pleasures of the world,"
13351,There stay until the twelve celestial signs
13352,Have brought about the annual reckoning.
13353,If this austere insociable life
13354,Change not your offer made in heat of blood;
13355,"If frosts and fasts, hard lodging and thin weeds,"
13356,"Nip not the gaudy blossoms of your love,"
13357,"But that it bear this trial, and last love;"
13358,"Then, at the expiration of the year,"
13359,"Come challenge me, challenge me by these deserts,"
13360,"And, by this virgin palm now kissing thine,"
13361,"I will be thine. And, till that instance, shut"
13362,"My woeful self up in a mournful house,"
13363,Raining the tears of lamentation
13364,For the remembrance of my father’s death.
13365,"If this thou do deny, let our hands part,"
13366,Neither entitled in the other’s heart.
13367,"If this, or more than this, I would deny,"
13368,"To flatter up these powers of mine with rest,"
13369,The sudden hand of death close up mine eye!
13370,"Hence hermit, then. My heart is in thy breast."
13371,"And what to me, my love? But what to me?"
13372,"A beard, fair health, and honesty;"
13373,With threefold love I wish you all these three.
13374,"O, shall I say, “I thank you, gentle wife”?"
13375,"No so, my lord. A twelvemonth and a day"
13376,I’ll mark no words that smooth-faced wooers say.
13377,Come when the King doth to my lady come;
13378,"Then, if I have much love, I’ll give you some."
13379,I’ll serve thee true and faithfully till then.
13380,"Yet swear not, lest ye be forsworn again."
13381,At the twelvemonth’s end
13382,I’ll change my black gown for a faithful friend.
13383,"I’ll stay with patience, but the time is long."
13384,The liker you; few taller are so young.
13385,"Studies my lady? Mistress, look on me."
13386,"Behold the window of my heart, mine eye,"
13387,What humble suit attends thy answer there.
13388,Impose some service on me for thy love.
13389,"Oft have I heard of you, my Lord Berowne,"
13390,Before I saw you; and the world’s large tongue
13391,"Proclaims you for a man replete with mocks,"
13392,"Full of comparisons and wounding flouts,"
13393,Which you on all estates will execute
13394,That lie within the mercy of your wit.
13395,"To weed this wormwood from your fruitful brain,"
13396,"And therewithal to win me, if you please,"
13397,"Without the which I am not to be won,"
13398,You shall this twelvemonth term from day to day
13399,"Visit the speechless sick, and still converse"
13400,"With groaning wretches; and your task shall be,"
13401,With all the fierce endeavour of your wit
13402,To enforce the pained impotent to smile.
13403,To move wild laughter in the throat of death?
13404,"It cannot be, it is impossible."
13405,Mirth cannot move a soul in agony.
13406,"Why, that’s the way to choke a gibing spirit,"
13407,Whose influence is begot of that loose grace
13408,Which shallow laughing hearers give to fools.
13409,A jest’s prosperity lies in the ear
13410,"Of him that hears it, never in the tongue"
13411,"Of him that makes it. Then, if sickly ears,"
13412,"Deafed with the clamours of their own dear groans,"
13413,"Will hear your idle scorns, continue then,"
13414,And I will have you and that fault withal;
13415,"But if they will not, throw away that spirit,"
13416,"And I shall find you empty of that fault,"
13417,Right joyful of your reformation.
13418,"A twelvemonth? Well, befall what will befall,"
13419,I’ll jest a twelvemonth in an hospital.
13420,"No, madam, we will bring you on your way."
13421,Our wooing doth not end like an old play.
13422,Jack hath not Jill. These ladies’ courtesy
13423,Might well have made our sport a comedy.
13424,"Come, sir, it wants a twelvemonth and a day,"
13425,And then ’twill end.
13426,That’s too long for a play.
13427,"Enter Armado, the Braggart."
13428,"Sweet Majesty, vouchsafe me—"
13429,Was not that Hector?
13430,The worthy knight of Troy.
13431,"I will kiss thy royal finger, and take leave. I am a votary; I have"
13432,vowed to Jaquenetta to hold the plough for her sweet love three year.
13433,"But, most esteemed Greatness, will you hear the dialogue that the two"
13434,learned men have compiled in praise of the owl and the cuckoo? It
13435,should have followed in the end of our show.
13436,Call them forth quickly; we will do so.
13437,"This side is _Hiems_, Winter; this _Ver_, the Spring; the one"
13438,"maintained by the owl, th’ other by the cuckoo. _Ver_, begin."
13439,When daisies pied and violets blue
13440,And lady-smocks all silver-white
13441,And cuckoo-buds of yellow hue
13442,"Do paint the meadows with delight,"
13443,The cuckoo then on every tree
13444,Mocks married men; for thus sings he:
13445,"Cuckoo, cuckoo!” O, word of fear,"
13446,Unpleasing to a married ear.
13447,"When shepherds pipe on oaten straws,"
13448,"And merry larks are ploughmen’s clocks,"
13449,"When turtles tread, and rooks and daws,"
13450,"And maidens bleach their summer smocks,"
13451,"The cuckoo then, on every tree,"
13452,"Mocks married men, for thus sings he:"
13453,"Cuckoo, cuckoo!” O, word of fear,"
13454,Unpleasing to a married ear.
13455,"When icicles hang by the wall,"
13456,"And Dick the shepherd blows his nail,"
13457,"And Tom bears logs into the hall,"
13458,"And milk comes frozen home in pail,"
13459,"When blood is nipped, and ways be foul,"
13460,Then nightly sings the staring owl:
13461,"“Tu-whit, Tu-whoo!” A merry note,"
13462,While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.
13463,"When all aloud the wind doth blow,"
13464,"And coughing drowns the parson’s saw,"
13465,"And birds sit brooding in the snow,"
13466,"And Marian’s nose looks red and raw,"
13467,"When roasted crabs hiss in the bowl,"
13468,Then nightly sings the staring owl:
13469,"“Tu-whit, Tu-whoo!” A merry note,"
13470,While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.
13471,The words of Mercury are harsh after the songs of Apollo.
13472,"You that way, we this way."

13520,"the Play, in Scotland; and chiefly at Macbeth’s Castle."
13521,SCENE I. An open Place.
13522,Thunder and Lightning. Enter three Witches.
13523,When shall we three meet again?
13524,"In thunder, lightning, or in rain?"
13525,"When the hurlyburly’s done,"
13526,When the battle’s lost and won.
13527,That will be ere the set of sun.
13528,There to meet with Macbeth.
13529,"Fair is foul, and foul is fair:"
13530,Hover through the fog and filthy air.
13531,SCENE II. A Camp near Forres.
13532,"Alarum within. Enter King Duncan, Malcolm, Donalbain, Lennox, with"
13533,"Attendants, meeting a bleeding Captain."
13534,"What bloody man is that? He can report,"
13535,"As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt"
13536,This is the sergeant
13537,"Who, like a good and hardy soldier, fought"
13538,"’Gainst my captivity.—Hail, brave friend!"
13539,Say to the King the knowledge of the broil
13540,As thou didst leave it.
13541,As two spent swimmers that do cling together
13542,And choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald
13543,"(Worthy to be a rebel, for to that"
13544,The multiplying villainies of nature
13545,Do swarm upon him) from the Western Isles
13546,Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied;
13547,"And Fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,"
13548,Show’d like a rebel’s whore. But all’s too weak;
13549,"For brave Macbeth (well he deserves that name),"
13550,"Disdaining Fortune, with his brandish’d steel,"
13551,"Which smok’d with bloody execution,"
13552,"Like Valour’s minion, carv’d out his passage,"
13553,Till he fac’d the slave;
13554,"Which ne’er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,"
13555,"Till he unseam’d him from the nave to the chops,"
13556,And fix’d his head upon our battlements.
13557,O valiant cousin! worthy gentleman!
13558,As whence the sun ’gins his reflection
13559,"Shipwracking storms and direful thunders break,"
13560,"So from that spring, whence comfort seem’d to come"
13561,"Discomfort swells. Mark, King of Scotland, mark:"
13562,"No sooner justice had, with valour arm’d,"
13563,"Compell’d these skipping kerns to trust their heels,"
13564,"But the Norweyan lord, surveying vantage,"
13565,"With furbish’d arms and new supplies of men,"
13566,Began a fresh assault.
13567,"Our captains, Macbeth and Banquo?"
13568,"As sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion."
13569,"If I say sooth, I must report they were"
13570,As cannons overcharg’d with double cracks;
13571,Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe:
13572,"Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds,"
13573,"Or memorize another Golgotha,"
13574,"But I am faint, my gashes cry for help."
13575,So well thy words become thee as thy wounds:
13576,"They smack of honour both.—Go, get him surgeons."
13577,Enter Ross and Angus.
13578,The worthy Thane of Ross.
13579,What a haste looks through his eyes! So should he look
13580,That seems to speak things strange.
13581,God save the King!
13582,"Whence cam’st thou, worthy thane?"
13583,"From Fife, great King,"
13584,Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky
13585,And fan our people cold.
13586,"Norway himself, with terrible numbers,"
13587,"Assisted by that most disloyal traitor,"
13588,"The Thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict;"
13589,"Till that Bellona’s bridegroom, lapp’d in proof,"
13590,"Confronted him with self-comparisons,"
13591,"Point against point, rebellious arm ’gainst arm,"
13592,"Curbing his lavish spirit: and, to conclude,"
13593,The victory fell on us.
13594,"Sweno, the Norways’ king, craves composition;"
13595,Nor would we deign him burial of his men
13596,Till he disbursed at Saint Colme’s Inch
13597,Ten thousand dollars to our general use.
13598,No more that Thane of Cawdor shall deceive
13599,"Our bosom interest. Go pronounce his present death,"
13600,And with his former title greet Macbeth.
13601,I’ll see it done.
13602,"What he hath lost, noble Macbeth hath won."
13603,SCENE III. A heath.
13604,Thunder. Enter the three Witches.
13605,"Where hast thou been, sister?"
13606,"A sailor’s wife had chestnuts in her lap,"
13607,"And mounch’d, and mounch’d, and mounch’d. “Give me,” quoth I."
13608,"“Aroint thee, witch!” the rump-fed ronyon cries."
13609,"Her husband’s to Aleppo gone, master o’ th’ _Tiger:_"
13610,"But in a sieve I’ll thither sail,"
13611,"And, like a rat without a tail,"
13612,"I’ll do, I’ll do, and I’ll do."
13613,I’ll give thee a wind.
13614,"I myself have all the other,"
13615,"And the very ports they blow,"
13616,All the quarters that they know
13617,I’ the shipman’s card.
13618,I will drain him dry as hay:
13619,Sleep shall neither night nor day
13620,Hang upon his pent-house lid;
13621,He shall live a man forbid.
13622,"Weary sev’n-nights nine times nine,"
13623,"Shall he dwindle, peak, and pine:"
13624,"Though his bark cannot be lost,"
13625,Yet it shall be tempest-tost.
13626,Look what I have.
13627,"Show me, show me."
13628,"Here I have a pilot’s thumb,"
13629,Wrack’d as homeward he did come.
13630,"A drum, a drum!"
13631,"The Weird Sisters, hand in hand,"
13632,"Posters of the sea and land,"
13633,"Thus do go about, about:"
13634,"Thrice to thine, and thrice to mine,"
13635,"And thrice again, to make up nine."
13636,Peace!—the charm’s wound up.
13637,Enter Macbeth and Banquo.
13638,So foul and fair a day I have not seen.
13639,"How far is’t call’d to Forres?—What are these,"
13640,"So wither’d, and so wild in their attire,"
13641,"That look not like the inhabitants o’ th’ earth,"
13642,And yet are on’t?—Live you? or are you aught
13643,"That man may question? You seem to understand me,"
13644,By each at once her choppy finger laying
13645,"Upon her skinny lips. You should be women,"
13646,And yet your beards forbid me to interpret
13647,That you are so.
13648,"Speak, if you can;—what are you?"
13649,"All hail, Macbeth! hail to thee, Thane of Glamis!"
13650,"All hail, Macbeth! hail to thee, Thane of Cawdor!"
13651,"All hail, Macbeth! that shalt be king hereafter!"
13652,"Good sir, why do you start and seem to fear"
13653,"Things that do sound so fair?—I’ th’ name of truth,"
13654,"Are ye fantastical, or that indeed"
13655,Which outwardly ye show? My noble partner
13656,You greet with present grace and great prediction
13657,"Of noble having and of royal hope,"
13658,That he seems rapt withal. To me you speak not.
13659,"If you can look into the seeds of time,"
13660,"And say which grain will grow, and which will not,"
13661,"Speak then to me, who neither beg nor fear"
13662,Your favours nor your hate.
13663,"Lesser than Macbeth, and greater."
13664,"Not so happy, yet much happier."
13665,"Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none:"
13666,"So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!"
13667,"Banquo and Macbeth, all hail!"
13668,"Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more."
13669,By Sinel’s death I know I am Thane of Glamis;
13670,"But how of Cawdor? The Thane of Cawdor lives,"
13671,A prosperous gentleman; and to be king
13672,"Stands not within the prospect of belief,"
13673,No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence
13674,You owe this strange intelligence? or why
13675,Upon this blasted heath you stop our way
13676,"With such prophetic greeting?—Speak, I charge you."
13677,"The earth hath bubbles, as the water has,"
13678,And these are of them. Whither are they vanish’d?
13679,"Into the air; and what seem’d corporal,"
13680,Melted as breath into the wind.
13681,Would they had stay’d!
13682,Were such things here as we do speak about?
13683,Or have we eaten on the insane root
13684,That takes the reason prisoner?
13685,Your children shall be kings.
13686,You shall be king.
13687,And Thane of Cawdor too; went it not so?
13688,To the selfsame tune and words. Who’s here?
13689,Enter Ross and Angus.
13690,"The King hath happily receiv’d, Macbeth,"
13691,"The news of thy success, and when he reads"
13692,"Thy personal venture in the rebels’ fight,"
13693,His wonders and his praises do contend
13694,"Which should be thine or his: silenc’d with that,"
13695,"In viewing o’er the rest o’ th’ selfsame day,"
13696,"He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks,"
13697,"Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make,"
13698,Strange images of death. As thick as tale
13699,Came post with post; and everyone did bear
13700,"Thy praises in his kingdom’s great defence,"
13701,And pour’d them down before him.
13702,To give thee from our royal master thanks;
13703,"Only to herald thee into his sight,"
13704,"And, for an earnest of a greater honour,"
13705,"He bade me, from him, call thee Thane of Cawdor:"
13706,"In which addition, hail, most worthy thane,"
13707,For it is thine.
13708,"What, can the devil speak true?"
13709,The Thane of Cawdor lives: why do you dress me
13710,"Who was the Thane lives yet,"
13711,But under heavy judgement bears that life
13712,Which he deserves to lose. Whether he was combin’d
13713,"With those of Norway, or did line the rebel"
13714,"With hidden help and vantage, or that with both"
13715,"He labour’d in his country’s wrack, I know not;"
13716,"But treasons capital, confess’d and prov’d,"
13717,The greatest is behind. [_To Ross and Angus._] Thanks for your pains.
13718,When those that gave the Thane of Cawdor to me
13719,Promis’d no less to them?
13720,"Might yet enkindle you unto the crown,"
13721,Besides the Thane of Cawdor. But ’tis strange:
13722,"And oftentimes to win us to our harm,"
13723,The instruments of darkness tell us truths;
13724,"Win us with honest trifles, to betray’s"
13725,"Cousins, a word, I pray you."
13726,As happy prologues to the swelling act
13727,"Of the imperial theme.—I thank you, gentlemen.—"
13728,"Cannot be ill; cannot be good. If ill,"
13729,"Why hath it given me earnest of success,"
13730,Commencing in a truth? I am Thane of Cawdor:
13731,"If good, why do I yield to that suggestion"
13732,"Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair,"
13733,"And make my seated heart knock at my ribs,"
13734,Against the use of nature? Present fears
13735,Are less than horrible imaginings.
13736,"My thought, whose murder yet is but fantastical,"
13737,Shakes so my single state of man
13738,"That function is smother’d in surmise,"
13739,And nothing is but what is not.
13740,"Look, how our partner’s rapt."
13741,"New honours come upon him,"
13742,"Like our strange garments, cleave not to their mould"
13743,But with the aid of use.
13744,Time and the hour runs through the roughest day.
13745,"Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure."
13746,Give me your favour. My dull brain was wrought
13747,"With things forgotten. Kind gentlemen, your pains"
13748,Are register’d where every day I turn
13749,The leaf to read them.—Let us toward the King.—
13750,"Think upon what hath chanc’d; and at more time,"
13751,"The interim having weigh’d it, let us speak"
13752,Our free hearts each to other.
13753,"Till then, enough.—Come, friends."
13754,SCENE IV. Forres. A Room in the Palace.
13755,"Flourish. Enter Duncan, Malcolm, Donalbain, Lennox and Attendants."
13756,Is execution done on Cawdor? Are not
13757,Those in commission yet return’d?
13758,They are not yet come back. But I have spoke
13759,"With one that saw him die, who did report,"
13760,"That very frankly he confess’d his treasons,"
13761,"Implor’d your Highness’ pardon, and set forth"
13762,A deep repentance. Nothing in his life
13763,Became him like the leaving it; he died
13764,"As one that had been studied in his death,"
13765,To throw away the dearest thing he ow’d
13766,As ’twere a careless trifle.
13767,To find the mind’s construction in the face:
13768,He was a gentleman on whom I built
13769,"Enter Macbeth, Banquo, Ross and Angus."
13770,The sin of my ingratitude even now
13771,"Was heavy on me. Thou art so far before,"
13772,That swiftest wing of recompense is slow
13773,To overtake thee. Would thou hadst less deserv’d;
13774,That the proportion both of thanks and payment
13775,"Might have been mine! only I have left to say,"
13776,More is thy due than more than all can pay.
13777,"The service and the loyalty I owe,"
13778,"In doing it, pays itself. Your Highness’ part"
13779,Is to receive our duties: and our duties
13780,"Are to your throne and state, children and servants;"
13781,"Which do but what they should, by doing everything"
13782,Safe toward your love and honour.
13783,"I have begun to plant thee, and will labour"
13784,"To make thee full of growing.—Noble Banquo,"
13785,"That hast no less deserv’d, nor must be known"
13786,"No less to have done so, let me infold thee"
13787,And hold thee to my heart.
13788,"There if I grow,"
13789,The harvest is your own.
13790,"Wanton in fulness, seek to hide themselves"
13791,"In drops of sorrow.—Sons, kinsmen, thanes,"
13792,"And you whose places are the nearest, know,"
13793,We will establish our estate upon
13794,"Our eldest, Malcolm; whom we name hereafter"
13795,The Prince of Cumberland: which honour must
13796,"Not unaccompanied invest him only,"
13797,"But signs of nobleness, like stars, shall shine"
13798,"On all deservers.—From hence to Inverness,"
13799,And bind us further to you.
13800,"The rest is labour, which is not us’d for you:"
13801,"I’ll be myself the harbinger, and make joyful"
13802,The hearing of my wife with your approach;
13803,"So, humbly take my leave."
13804,"On which I must fall down, or else o’erleap,"
13805,"For in my way it lies. Stars, hide your fires!"
13806,Let not light see my black and deep desires.
13807,"The eye wink at the hand, yet let that be,"
13808,"Which the eye fears, when it is done, to see."
13809,"True, worthy Banquo! He is full so valiant;"
13810,And in his commendations I am fed.
13811,"It is a banquet to me. Let’s after him,"
13812,Whose care is gone before to bid us welcome:
13813,It is a peerless kinsman.
13814,SCENE V. Inverness. A Room in Macbeth’s Castle.
13815,"Enter Lady Macbeth, reading a letter."
13816,“They met me in the day of success; and I have learned by the
13817,perfect’st report they have more in them than mortal knowledge. When I
13818,"burned in desire to question them further, they made themselves air,"
13819,"into which they vanished. Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it, came"
13820,"missives from the King, who all-hailed me, ‘Thane of Cawdor’; by which"
13821,"title, before, these Weird Sisters saluted me, and referred me to the"
13822,"coming on of time, with ‘Hail, king that shalt be!’ This have I thought"
13823,good to deliver thee (my dearest partner of greatness) that thou
13824,"might’st not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being ignorant of what"
13825,"greatness is promis’d thee. Lay it to thy heart, and farewell.”"
13826,"Glamis thou art, and Cawdor; and shalt be"
13827,What thou art promis’d. Yet do I fear thy nature;
13828,It is too full o’ th’ milk of human kindness
13829,To catch the nearest way. Thou wouldst be great;
13830,"Art not without ambition, but without"
13831,"The illness should attend it. What thou wouldst highly,"
13832,"That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false,"
13833,"And yet wouldst wrongly win. Thou’dst have, great Glamis,"
13834,"That which cries, “Thus thou must do,” if thou have it;"
13835,"And that which rather thou dost fear to do,"
13836,"Than wishest should be undone. Hie thee hither,"
13837,"That I may pour my spirits in thine ear,"
13838,And chastise with the valour of my tongue
13839,"All that impedes thee from the golden round,"
13840,Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem
13841,To have thee crown’d withal.
13842,What is your tidings?
13843,The King comes here tonight.
13844,Thou’rt mad to say it.
13845,"Is not thy master with him? who, were’t so,"
13846,Would have inform’d for preparation.
13847,"So please you, it is true. Our thane is coming."
13848,"One of my fellows had the speed of him,"
13849,"Who, almost dead for breath, had scarcely more"
13850,Than would make up his message.
13851,He brings great news.
13852,The raven himself is hoarse
13853,That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan
13854,"Under my battlements. Come, you spirits"
13855,"That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here,"
13856,"And fill me, from the crown to the toe, top-full"
13857,"Of direst cruelty! make thick my blood,"
13858,"Stop up th’ access and passage to remorse,"
13859,That no compunctious visitings of nature
13860,"Shake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between"
13861,"Th’ effect and it! Come to my woman’s breasts,"
13862,"And take my milk for gall, your murd’ring ministers,"
13863,Wherever in your sightless substances
13864,"You wait on nature’s mischief! Come, thick night,"
13865,And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell
13866,"That my keen knife see not the wound it makes,"
13867,Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark
13868,"To cry, “Hold, hold!”"
13869,"Great Glamis, worthy Cawdor!"
13870,"Greater than both, by the all-hail hereafter!"
13871,Thy letters have transported me beyond
13872,"This ignorant present, and I feel now"
13873,The future in the instant.
13874,Duncan comes here tonight.
13875,And when goes hence?
13876,"Tomorrow, as he purposes."
13877,Shall sun that morrow see!
13878,"Your face, my thane, is as a book where men"
13879,"May read strange matters. To beguile the time,"
13880,"Look like the time; bear welcome in your eye,"
13881,"Your hand, your tongue: look like the innocent flower,"
13882,But be the serpent under’t. He that’s coming
13883,Must be provided for; and you shall put
13884,This night’s great business into my dispatch;
13885,Which shall to all our nights and days to come
13886,Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom.
13887,We will speak further.
13888,Only look up clear;
13889,To alter favour ever is to fear.
13890,Leave all the rest to me.
13891,SCENE VI. The same. Before the Castle.
13892,Hautboys. Servants of Macbeth attending.
13893,"Enter Duncan, Malcolm, Donalbain, Banquo, Lennox, Macduff, Ross, Angus"
13894,This castle hath a pleasant seat. The air
13895,Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself
13896,Unto our gentle senses.
13897,"This guest of summer,"
13898,"The temple-haunting martlet, does approve,"
13899,"By his loved mansionry, that the heaven’s breath"
13900,"Smells wooingly here: no jutty, frieze,"
13901,"Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird"
13902,hath made his pendant bed and procreant cradle.
13903,"Where they most breed and haunt, I have observ’d"
13904,The air is delicate.
13905,"See, see, our honour’d hostess!—"
13906,"The love that follows us sometime is our trouble,"
13907,Which still we thank as love. Herein I teach you
13908,"How you shall bid God ’ild us for your pains,"
13909,And thank us for your trouble.
13910,"In every point twice done, and then done double,"
13911,Were poor and single business to contend
13912,Against those honours deep and broad wherewith
13913,"Your Majesty loads our house: for those of old,"
13914,"And the late dignities heap’d up to them,"
13915,We rest your hermits.
13916,Where’s the Thane of Cawdor?
13917,"We cours’d him at the heels, and had a purpose"
13918,To be his purveyor: but he rides well;
13919,"And his great love, sharp as his spur, hath holp him"
13920,"To his home before us. Fair and noble hostess,"
13921,We are your guest tonight.
13922,"Have theirs, themselves, and what is theirs, in compt,"
13923,"To make their audit at your Highness’ pleasure,"
13924,Still to return your own.
13925,Give me your hand;
13926,"Conduct me to mine host: we love him highly,"
13927,And shall continue our graces towards him.
13928,"By your leave, hostess."
13929,SCENE VII. The same. A Lobby in the Castle.
13930,"Hautboys and torches. Enter, and pass over, a Sewer and divers"
13931,Servants with dishes and service. Then enter Macbeth.
13932,"If it were done when ’tis done, then ’twere well"
13933,It were done quickly. If th’ assassination
13934,"Could trammel up the consequence, and catch"
13935,With his surcease success; that but this blow
13936,"Might be the be-all and the end-all—here,"
13937,"But here, upon this bank and shoal of time,"
13938,We’d jump the life to come. But in these cases
13939,We still have judgement here; that we but teach
13940,"Bloody instructions, which being taught, return"
13941,To plague th’ inventor. This even-handed justice
13942,Commends th’ ingredience of our poison’d chalice
13943,To our own lips. He’s here in double trust:
13944,"First, as I am his kinsman and his subject,"
13945,"Strong both against the deed; then, as his host,"
13946,"Who should against his murderer shut the door,"
13947,"Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan"
13948,"Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been"
13949,"So clear in his great office, that his virtues"
13950,"Will plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against"
13951,The deep damnation of his taking-off;
13952,"And pity, like a naked new-born babe,"
13953,"Striding the blast, or heaven’s cherubin, hors’d"
13954,"Upon the sightless couriers of the air,"
13955,"Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,"
13956,That tears shall drown the wind.—I have no spur
13957,"To prick the sides of my intent, but only"
13958,"Vaulting ambition, which o’erleaps itself"
13959,And falls on th’ other—
13960,How now! what news?
13961,He has almost supp’d. Why have you left the chamber?
13962,Hath he ask’d for me?
13963,Know you not he has?
13964,We will proceed no further in this business:
13965,He hath honour’d me of late; and I have bought
13966,"Golden opinions from all sorts of people,"
13967,"Which would be worn now in their newest gloss,"
13968,Not cast aside so soon.
13969,Was the hope drunk
13970,Wherein you dress’d yourself? Hath it slept since?
13971,"And wakes it now, to look so green and pale"
13972,At what it did so freely? From this time
13973,Such I account thy love. Art thou afeard
13974,To be the same in thine own act and valour
13975,As thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have that
13976,"Which thou esteem’st the ornament of life,"
13977,"And live a coward in thine own esteem,"
13978,"Letting “I dare not” wait upon “I would,”"
13979,Like the poor cat i’ th’ adage?
13980,I dare do all that may become a man;
13981,Who dares do more is none.
13982,"What beast was’t, then,"
13983,That made you break this enterprise to me?
13984,"When you durst do it, then you were a man;"
13985,"And, to be more than what you were, you would"
13986,Be so much more the man. Nor time nor place
13987,"Did then adhere, and yet you would make both:"
13988,"They have made themselves, and that their fitness now"
13989,"Does unmake you. I have given suck, and know"
13990,How tender ’tis to love the babe that milks me:
13991,"I would, while it was smiling in my face,"
13992,Have pluck’d my nipple from his boneless gums
13993,"And dash’d the brains out, had I so sworn as you"
13994,Have done to this.
13995,If we should fail?
13996,"But screw your courage to the sticking-place,"
13997,And we’ll not fail. When Duncan is asleep
13998,(Whereto the rather shall his day’s hard journey
13999,"Soundly invite him), his two chamberlains"
14000,Will I with wine and wassail so convince
14001,"That memory, the warder of the brain,"
14002,"Shall be a fume, and the receipt of reason"
14003,A limbeck only: when in swinish sleep
14004,"Their drenched natures lie as in a death,"
14005,What cannot you and I perform upon
14006,Th’ unguarded Duncan? what not put upon
14007,His spongy officers; who shall bear the guilt
14008,Of our great quell?
14009,Bring forth men-children only;
14010,For thy undaunted mettle should compose
14011,"Nothing but males. Will it not be receiv’d,"
14012,When we have mark’d with blood those sleepy two
14013,"Of his own chamber, and us’d their very daggers,"
14014,That they have done’t?
14015,"Who dares receive it other,"
14016,As we shall make our griefs and clamour roar
14017,"I am settled, and bend up"
14018,Each corporal agent to this terrible feat.
14019,"Away, and mock the time with fairest show:"
14020,False face must hide what the false heart doth know.
14021,SCENE I. Inverness. Court within the Castle.
14022,Enter Banquo and Fleance with a torch before him.
14023,"How goes the night, boy?"
14024,The moon is down; I have not heard the clock.
14025,And she goes down at twelve.
14026,"I take’t, ’tis later, sir."
14027,"Hold, take my sword.—There’s husbandry in heaven;"
14028,Their candles are all out. Take thee that too.
14029,"A heavy summons lies like lead upon me,"
14030,"And yet I would not sleep. Merciful powers,"
14031,Restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature
14032,Gives way to in repose!
14033,Enter Macbeth and a Servant with a torch.
14034,Give me my sword.—Who’s there?
14035,"What, sir, not yet at rest? The King’s abed:"
14036,He hath been in unusual pleasure and
14037,Sent forth great largess to your offices.
14038,"This diamond he greets your wife withal,"
14039,"By the name of most kind hostess, and shut up"
14040,"Our will became the servant to defect,"
14041,Which else should free have wrought.
14042,I dreamt last night of the three Weird Sisters:
14043,To you they have show’d some truth.
14044,I think not of them:
14045,"Yet, when we can entreat an hour to serve,"
14046,"We would spend it in some words upon that business,"
14047,If you would grant the time.
14048,At your kind’st leisure.
14049,"If you shall cleave to my consent, when ’tis,"
14050,It shall make honour for you.
14051,So I lose none
14052,"In seeking to augment it, but still keep"
14053,"My bosom franchis’d, and allegiance clear,"
14054,I shall be counsell’d.
14055,Good repose the while!
14056,"Thanks, sir: the like to you."
14057,"Go bid thy mistress, when my drink is ready,"
14058,She strike upon the bell. Get thee to bed.
14059,"Is this a dagger which I see before me,"
14060,"The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee:—"
14061,"I have thee not, and yet I see thee still."
14062,"Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible"
14063,To feeling as to sight? or art thou but
14064,"A dagger of the mind, a false creation,"
14065,Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?
14066,"I see thee yet, in form as palpable"
14067,As this which now I draw.
14068,Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going;
14069,And such an instrument I was to use.
14070,"Mine eyes are made the fools o’ the other senses,"
14071,Or else worth all the rest: I see thee still;
14072,"And on thy blade and dudgeon, gouts of blood,"
14073,Which was not so before.—There’s no such thing.
14074,It is the bloody business which informs
14075,Thus to mine eyes.—Now o’er the one half-world
14076,"Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse"
14077,The curtain’d sleep. Witchcraft celebrates
14078,"Pale Hecate’s off’rings; and wither’d murder,"
14079,"Alarum’d by his sentinel, the wolf,"
14080,"Whose howl’s his watch, thus with his stealthy pace,"
14081,"With Tarquin’s ravishing strides, towards his design"
14082,"Moves like a ghost.—Thou sure and firm-set earth,"
14083,"Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear"
14084,"Thy very stones prate of my whereabout,"
14085,"And take the present horror from the time,"
14086,"Which now suits with it.—Whiles I threat, he lives."
14087,Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives.
14088,"I go, and it is done. The bell invites me."
14089,"Hear it not, Duncan, for it is a knell"
14090,That summons thee to heaven or to hell.
14091,SCENE II. The same.
14092,That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold:
14093,What hath quench’d them hath given me fire.—Hark!—Peace!
14094,"It was the owl that shriek’d, the fatal bellman,"
14095,Which gives the stern’st good night. He is about it.
14096,The doors are open; and the surfeited grooms
14097,"Do mock their charge with snores: I have drugg’d their possets,"
14098,"That death and nature do contend about them,"
14099,Whether they live or die.
14100,"Alack! I am afraid they have awak’d,"
14101,And ’tis not done. Th’ attempt and not the deed
14102,Confounds us.—Hark!—I laid their daggers ready;
14103,He could not miss ’em.—Had he not resembled
14104,"My father as he slept, I had done’t.—My husband!"
14105,I have done the deed.—Didst thou not hear a noise?
14106,I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry.
14107,Did not you speak?
14108,Hark!—Who lies i’ th’ second chamber?
14109,This is a sorry sight.
14110,"A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight."
14111,"There’s one did laugh in’s sleep, and one cried, “Murder!”"
14112,That they did wake each other: I stood and heard them.
14113,"But they did say their prayers, and address’d them"
14114,There are two lodg’d together.
14115,"One cried, “God bless us!” and, “Amen,” the other,"
14116,As they had seen me with these hangman’s hands.
14117,"List’ning their fear, I could not say “Amen,”"
14118,"When they did say, “God bless us.”"
14119,Consider it not so deeply.
14120,But wherefore could not I pronounce “Amen”?
14121,"I had most need of blessing, and “Amen”"
14122,Stuck in my throat.
14123,These deeds must not be thought
14124,"After these ways; so, it will make us mad."
14125,"Methought I heard a voice cry, “Sleep no more!"
14126,"Macbeth does murder sleep,”—the innocent sleep;"
14127,"Sleep that knits up the ravell’d sleave of care,"
14128,"The death of each day’s life, sore labour’s bath,"
14129,"Balm of hurt minds, great nature’s second course,"
14130,Chief nourisher in life’s feast.
14131,What do you mean?
14132,"Still it cried, “Sleep no more!” to all the house:"
14133,"“Glamis hath murder’d sleep, and therefore Cawdor"
14134,Shall sleep no more. Macbeth shall sleep no more!”
14135,"Who was it that thus cried? Why, worthy thane,"
14136,You do unbend your noble strength to think
14137,"So brainsickly of things. Go get some water,"
14138,And wash this filthy witness from your hand.—
14139,Why did you bring these daggers from the place?
14140,"They must lie there: go carry them, and smear"
14141,The sleepy grooms with blood.
14142,I’ll go no more:
14143,I am afraid to think what I have done;
14144,Look on’t again I dare not.
14145,Give me the daggers. The sleeping and the dead
14146,Are but as pictures. ’Tis the eye of childhood
14147,"That fears a painted devil. If he do bleed,"
14148,"I’ll gild the faces of the grooms withal,"
14149,For it must seem their guilt.
14150,Whence is that knocking?
14151,"How is’t with me, when every noise appals me?"
14152,"What hands are here? Ha, they pluck out mine eyes!"
14153,Will all great Neptune’s ocean wash this blood
14154,"Clean from my hand? No, this my hand will rather"
14155,"The multitudinous seas incarnadine,"
14156,Making the green one red.
14157,"My hands are of your color, but I shame"
14158,To wear a heart so white. [_Knocking within._] I hear knocking
14159,At the south entry:—retire we to our chamber.
14160,A little water clears us of this deed:
14161,How easy is it then! Your constancy
14162,"Hath left you unattended.—[_Knocking within._] Hark, more knocking."
14163,"Get on your nightgown, lest occasion call us"
14164,And show us to be watchers. Be not lost
14165,So poorly in your thoughts.
14166,"To know my deed, ’twere best not know myself. [_Knocking within._]"
14167,Wake Duncan with thy knocking! I would thou couldst!
14168,SCENE III. The same.
14169,Enter a Porter. Knocking within.
14170,"Here’s a knocking indeed! If a man were porter of hell gate, he should"
14171,"have old turning the key. [_Knocking._] Knock, knock, knock. Who’s"
14172,"there, i’ th’ name of Belzebub? Here’s a farmer that hanged himself on"
14173,the expectation of plenty: come in time; have napkins enow about you;
14174,"here you’ll sweat for’t. [_Knocking._] Knock, knock! Who’s there, i’"
14175,"th’ other devil’s name? Faith, here’s an equivocator, that could swear"
14176,"in both the scales against either scale, who committed treason enough"
14177,"for God’s sake, yet could not equivocate to heaven: O, come in,"
14178,"equivocator. [_Knocking._] Knock, knock, knock! Who’s there? Faith,"
14179,"here’s an English tailor come hither, for stealing out of a French"
14180,"hose: come in, tailor; here you may roast your goose. [_Knocking._]"
14181,"Knock, knock. Never at quiet! What are you?—But this place is too cold"
14182,for hell. I’ll devil-porter it no further: I had thought to have let in
14183,"some of all professions, that go the primrose way to th’ everlasting"
14184,"bonfire. [_Knocking._] Anon, anon! I pray you, remember the porter."
14185,Enter Macduff and Lennox.
14186,"Was it so late, friend, ere you went to bed,"
14187,That you do lie so late?
14188,"Faith, sir, we were carousing till the second cock; and drink, sir, is"
14189,a great provoker of three things.
14190,What three things does drink especially provoke?
14191,"Marry, sir, nose-painting, sleep, and urine. Lechery, sir, it provokes"
14192,"and unprovokes; it provokes the desire, but it takes away the"
14193,performance. Therefore much drink may be said to be an equivocator with
14194,"lechery: it makes him, and it mars him; it sets him on, and it takes"
14195,"him off; it persuades him, and disheartens him; makes him stand to, and"
14196,"not stand to; in conclusion, equivocates him in a sleep, and giving him"
14197,"the lie, leaves him."
14198,I believe drink gave thee the lie last night.
14199,"That it did, sir, i’ the very throat on me; but I requited him for his"
14200,"lie; and (I think) being too strong for him, though he took up my legs"
14201,"sometime, yet I made a shift to cast him."
14202,Is thy master stirring?
14203,Our knocking has awak’d him; here he comes.
14204,"Good morrow, noble sir!"
14205,"Is the King stirring, worthy thane?"
14206,He did command me to call timely on him.
14207,I have almost slipp’d the hour.
14208,I’ll bring you to him.
14209,I know this is a joyful trouble to you;
14210,But yet ’tis one.
14211,The labour we delight in physics pain.
14212,This is the door.
14213,I’ll make so bold to call.
14214,For ’tis my limited service.
14215,Goes the King hence today?
14216,He does. He did appoint so.
14217,"The night has been unruly: where we lay,"
14218,"Our chimneys were blown down and, as they say,"
14219,"Lamentings heard i’ th’ air, strange screams of death,"
14220,"And prophesying, with accents terrible,"
14221,"Of dire combustion and confus’d events,"
14222,New hatch’d to the woeful time. The obscure bird
14223,Clamour’d the live-long night. Some say the earth
14224,"Was feverous, and did shake."
14225,’Twas a rough night.
14226,My young remembrance cannot parallel
14227,A fellow to it.
14228,"O horror, horror, horror!"
14229,Tongue nor heart cannot conceive nor name thee!
14230,Confusion now hath made his masterpiece!
14231,Most sacrilegious murder hath broke ope
14232,"The Lord’s anointed temple, and stole thence"
14233,The life o’ th’ building.
14234,What is’t you say? the life?
14235,Mean you his majesty?
14236,"Approach the chamber, and destroy your sight"
14237,With a new Gorgon. Do not bid me speak.
14238,"See, and then speak yourselves."
14239,Ring the alarum bell.—Murder and treason!
14240,Banquo and Donalbain! Malcolm! awake!
14241,"Shake off this downy sleep, death’s counterfeit,"
14242,"And look on death itself! Up, up, and see"
14243,The great doom’s image. Malcolm! Banquo!
14244,"As from your graves rise up, and walk like sprites"
14245,To countenance this horror!
14246,That such a hideous trumpet calls to parley
14247,"The sleepers of the house? Speak, speak!"
14248,’Tis not for you to hear what I can speak:
14249,"The repetition, in a woman’s ear,"
14250,Would murder as it fell.
14251,Our royal master’s murder’d!
14252,"What, in our house?"
14253,"Dear Duff, I pr’ythee, contradict thyself,"
14254,And say it is not so.
14255,Enter Macbeth and Lennox with Ross.
14256,"Had I but died an hour before this chance,"
14257,"I had liv’d a blessed time; for, from this instant"
14258,There’s nothing serious in mortality.
14259,All is but toys: renown and grace is dead;
14260,"The wine of life is drawn, and the mere lees"
14261,Is left this vault to brag of.
14262,Enter Malcolm and Donalbain.
14263,"You are, and do not know’t:"
14264,"The spring, the head, the fountain of your blood"
14265,Is stopp’d; the very source of it is stopp’d.
14266,Your royal father’s murder’d.
14267,"Those of his chamber, as it seem’d, had done’t:"
14268,Their hands and faces were all badg’d with blood;
14269,"So were their daggers, which, unwip’d, we found"
14270,"Upon their pillows. They star’d, and were distracted;"
14271,No man’s life was to be trusted with them.
14272,"O, yet I do repent me of my fury,"
14273,That I did kill them.
14274,Wherefore did you so?
14275,"Who can be wise, amaz’d, temperate, and furious,"
14276,"Loyal and neutral, in a moment? No man:"
14277,Th’ expedition of my violent love
14278,"Outrun the pauser, reason. Here lay Duncan,"
14279,His silver skin lac’d with his golden blood;
14280,And his gash’d stabs look’d like a breach in nature
14281,"For ruin’s wasteful entrance: there, the murderers,"
14282,"Steep’d in the colours of their trade, their daggers"
14283,"Unmannerly breech’d with gore. Who could refrain,"
14284,"That had a heart to love, and in that heart"
14285,Courage to make’s love known?
14286,"Help me hence, ho!"
14287,Look to the lady.
14288,"Why do we hold our tongues,"
14289,That most may claim this argument for ours?
14290,"What should be spoken here, where our fate,"
14291,"Hid in an auger hole, may rush, and seize us?"
14292,Let’s away. Our tears are not yet brew’d.
14293,Nor our strong sorrow
14294,Upon the foot of motion.
14295,Look to the lady:—
14296,"And when we have our naked frailties hid,"
14297,"That suffer in exposure, let us meet,"
14298,And question this most bloody piece of work
14299,To know it further. Fears and scruples shake us:
14300,In the great hand of God I stand; and thence
14301,Against the undivulg’d pretence I fight
14302,And so do I.
14303,"Let’s briefly put on manly readiness,"
14304,And meet i’ th’ hall together.
14305,What will you do? Let’s not consort with them:
14306,To show an unfelt sorrow is an office
14307,Which the false man does easy. I’ll to England.
14308,"To Ireland, I. Our separated fortune"
14309,"Shall keep us both the safer. Where we are,"
14310,"There’s daggers in men’s smiles: the near in blood,"
14311,This murderous shaft that’s shot
14312,Hath not yet lighted; and our safest way
14313,Is to avoid the aim. Therefore to horse;
14314,"And let us not be dainty of leave-taking,"
14315,But shift away. There’s warrant in that theft
14316,"Which steals itself, when there’s no mercy left."
14317,SCENE IV. The same. Without the Castle.
14318,Enter Ross and an Old Man.
14319,"Threescore and ten I can remember well,"
14320,Within the volume of which time I have seen
14321,"Hours dreadful and things strange, but this sore night"
14322,Hath trifled former knowings.
14323,"Thou seest the heavens, as troubled with man’s act,"
14324,"Threatens his bloody stage: by the clock ’tis day,"
14325,And yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp.
14326,"Is’t night’s predominance, or the day’s shame,"
14327,"That darkness does the face of earth entomb,"
14328,When living light should kiss it?
14329,"Even like the deed that’s done. On Tuesday last,"
14330,"A falcon, towering in her pride of place,"
14331,Was by a mousing owl hawk’d at and kill’d.
14332,And Duncan’s horses (a thing most strange and certain)
14333,"Beauteous and swift, the minions of their race,"
14334,"Turn’d wild in nature, broke their stalls, flung out,"
14335,"Contending ’gainst obedience, as they would make"
14336,’Tis said they eat each other.
14337,"They did so; to the amazement of mine eyes,"
14338,Here comes the good Macduff.
14339,"How goes the world, sir, now?"
14340,"Why, see you not?"
14341,Is’t known who did this more than bloody deed?
14342,Those that Macbeth hath slain.
14343,What good could they pretend?
14344,"Malcolm and Donalbain, the King’s two sons,"
14345,Are stol’n away and fled; which puts upon them
14346,Suspicion of the deed.
14347,"Thriftless ambition, that will ravin up"
14348,Thine own life’s means!—Then ’tis most like
14349,The sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth.
14350,He is already nam’d; and gone to Scone
14351,Where is Duncan’s body?
14352,"The sacred storehouse of his predecessors,"
14353,And guardian of their bones.
14354,Will you to Scone?
14355,"No, cousin, I’ll to Fife."
14356,"Well, I will thither."
14357,"Well, may you see things well done there. Adieu!"
14358,Lest our old robes sit easier than our new!
14359,God’s benison go with you; and with those
14360,"That would make good of bad, and friends of foes!"
14361,SCENE I. Forres. A Room in the Palace.
14362,"Thou hast it now, King, Cawdor, Glamis, all,"
14363,"As the Weird Women promis’d; and, I fear,"
14364,Thou play’dst most foully for’t; yet it was said
14365,It should not stand in thy posterity;
14366,But that myself should be the root and father
14367,Of many kings. If there come truth from them
14368,"Why, by the verities on thee made good,"
14369,"May they not be my oracles as well,"
14370,And set me up in hope? But hush; no more.
14371,"Sennet sounded. Enter Macbeth as King, Lady Macbeth as Queen; Lennox,"
14372,"Ross, Lords, and Attendants."
14373,Here’s our chief guest.
14374,"If he had been forgotten,"
14375,"It had been as a gap in our great feast,"
14376,"Tonight we hold a solemn supper, sir,"
14377,And I’ll request your presence.
14378,"Command upon me, to the which my duties"
14379,Are with a most indissoluble tie
14380,Ride you this afternoon?
14381,"Ay, my good lord."
14382,We should have else desir’d your good advice
14383,In this day’s council; but we’ll take tomorrow.
14384,Is’t far you ride?
14385,"As far, my lord, as will fill up the time"
14386,"’Twixt this and supper: go not my horse the better,"
14387,"I must become a borrower of the night,"
14388,For a dark hour or twain.
14389,Fail not our feast.
14390,"My lord, I will not."
14391,We hear our bloody cousins are bestow’d
14392,In England and in Ireland; not confessing
14393,"Their cruel parricide, filling their hearers"
14394,"With strange invention. But of that tomorrow,"
14395,When therewithal we shall have cause of state
14396,"Craving us jointly. Hie you to horse: adieu,"
14397,Till you return at night. Goes Fleance with you?
14398,"Ay, my good lord: our time does call upon’s."
14399,I wish your horses swift and sure of foot;
14400,And so I do commend you to their backs.
14401,Let every man be master of his time
14402,Till seven at night; to make society
14403,"The sweeter welcome, we will keep ourself"
14404,"Till supper time alone: while then, God be with you."
14405,"Sirrah, a word with you. Attend those men"
14406,"They are, my lord, without the palace gate."
14407,Bring them before us.
14408,"To be thus is nothing,"
14409,But to be safely thus. Our fears in Banquo
14410,"Stick deep, and in his royalty of nature"
14411,Reigns that which would be fear’d: ’tis much he dares;
14412,"And, to that dauntless temper of his mind,"
14413,He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour
14414,To act in safety. There is none but he
14415,Whose being I do fear: and under him
14416,"My genius is rebuk’d; as, it is said,"
14417,Mark Antony’s was by Caesar. He chid the sisters
14418,"When first they put the name of king upon me,"
14419,"And bade them speak to him; then, prophet-like,"
14420,They hail’d him father to a line of kings:
14421,"Upon my head they plac’d a fruitless crown,"
14422,"And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,"
14423,"Thence to be wrench’d with an unlineal hand,"
14424,"No son of mine succeeding. If’t be so,"
14425,For Banquo’s issue have I fil’d my mind;
14426,For them the gracious Duncan have I murder’d;
14427,Put rancours in the vessel of my peace
14428,Only for them; and mine eternal jewel
14429,"Given to the common enemy of man,"
14430,"To make them kings, the seed of Banquo kings!"
14431,"Rather than so, come, fate, into the list,"
14432,And champion me to th’ utterance!—Who’s there?—
14433,Enter Servant with two Murderers.
14434,"Now go to the door, and stay there till we call."
14435,Was it not yesterday we spoke together?
14436,"It was, so please your Highness."
14437,Have you consider’d of my speeches? Know
14438,"That it was he, in the times past, which held you"
14439,"So under fortune, which you thought had been"
14440,Our innocent self? This I made good to you
14441,"In our last conference, pass’d in probation with you"
14442,"How you were borne in hand, how cross’d, the instruments,"
14443,"Who wrought with them, and all things else that might"
14444,To half a soul and to a notion craz’d
14445,"Say, “Thus did Banquo.”"
14446,You made it known to us.
14447,"I did so; and went further, which is now"
14448,Our point of second meeting. Do you find
14449,"Your patience so predominant in your nature,"
14450,"That you can let this go? Are you so gospell’d,"
14451,"To pray for this good man and for his issue,"
14452,"Whose heavy hand hath bow’d you to the grave,"
14453,And beggar’d yours forever?
14454,"We are men, my liege."
14455,"Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men;"
14456,"As hounds, and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,"
14457,"Shoughs, water-rugs, and demi-wolves are clept"
14458,All by the name of dogs: the valu’d file
14459,"Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle,"
14460,"The housekeeper, the hunter, every one"
14461,According to the gift which bounteous nature
14462,Hath in him clos’d; whereby he does receive
14463,"Particular addition, from the bill"
14464,That writes them all alike: and so of men.
14465,"Now, if you have a station in the file,"
14466,"Not i’ th’ worst rank of manhood, say’t;"
14467,"And I will put that business in your bosoms,"
14468,"Whose execution takes your enemy off,"
14469,"Grapples you to the heart and love of us,"
14470,"Who wear our health but sickly in his life,"
14471,Which in his death were perfect.
14472,"I am one, my liege,"
14473,Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world
14474,Hath so incens’d that I am reckless what
14475,I do to spite the world.
14476,"So weary with disasters, tugg’d with fortune,"
14477,"That I would set my life on any chance,"
14478,To mend it or be rid on’t.
14479,Know Banquo was your enemy.
14480,"So is he mine; and in such bloody distance,"
14481,That every minute of his being thrusts
14482,Against my near’st of life; and though I could
14483,"With barefac’d power sweep him from my sight,"
14484,"And bid my will avouch it, yet I must not,"
14485,"For certain friends that are both his and mine,"
14486,"Whose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall"
14487,Who I myself struck down: and thence it is
14488,"That I to your assistance do make love,"
14489,Masking the business from the common eye
14490,For sundry weighty reasons.
14491,"We shall, my lord,"
14492,Perform what you command us.
14493,"Your spirits shine through you. Within this hour at most,"
14494,"I will advise you where to plant yourselves,"
14495,"Acquaint you with the perfect spy o’ th’ time,"
14496,The moment on’t; for’t must be done tonight
14497,And something from the palace; always thought
14498,That I require a clearness. And with him
14499,"Fleance his son, that keeps him company,"
14500,Whose absence is no less material to me
14501,"Than is his father’s, must embrace the fate"
14502,Of that dark hour. Resolve yourselves apart.
14503,I’ll come to you anon.
14504,"We are resolv’d, my lord."
14505,I’ll call upon you straight: abide within.
14506,"It is concluded. Banquo, thy soul’s flight,"
14507,"If it find heaven, must find it out tonight."
14508,SCENE II. The same. Another Room in the Palace.
14509,Enter Lady Macbeth and a Servant.
14510,Is Banquo gone from court?
14511,"Ay, madam, but returns again tonight."
14512,"Say to the King, I would attend his leisure"
14513,For a few words.
14514,"Naught’s had, all’s spent,"
14515,Where our desire is got without content:
14516,"’Tis safer to be that which we destroy,"
14517,Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy.
14518,"How now, my lord, why do you keep alone,"
14519,"Of sorriest fancies your companions making,"
14520,Using those thoughts which should indeed have died
14521,With them they think on? Things without all remedy
14522,Should be without regard: what’s done is done.
14523,"We have scorch’d the snake, not kill’d it."
14524,"She’ll close, and be herself; whilst our poor malice"
14525,Remains in danger of her former tooth.
14526,"But let the frame of things disjoint,"
14527,"Both the worlds suffer,"
14528,"Ere we will eat our meal in fear, and sleep"
14529,In the affliction of these terrible dreams
14530,"That shake us nightly. Better be with the dead,"
14531,"Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace,"
14532,Than on the torture of the mind to lie
14533,In restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave;
14534,After life’s fitful fever he sleeps well;
14535,"Treason has done his worst: nor steel, nor poison,"
14536,"Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing"
14537,Can touch him further.
14538,"Gently my lord, sleek o’er your rugged looks;"
14539,Be bright and jovial among your guests tonight.
14540,"So shall I, love; and so, I pray, be you."
14541,Let your remembrance apply to Banquo;
14542,"Present him eminence, both with eye and tongue:"
14543,"Unsafe the while, that we"
14544,"Must lave our honours in these flattering streams,"
14545,"And make our faces vizards to our hearts,"
14546,Disguising what they are.
14547,You must leave this.
14548,"O, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife!"
14549,"Thou know’st that Banquo, and his Fleance, lives."
14550,But in them nature’s copy’s not eterne.
14551,There’s comfort yet; they are assailable.
14552,Then be thou jocund. Ere the bat hath flown
14553,"His cloister’d flight, ere to black Hecate’s summons"
14554,"The shard-born beetle, with his drowsy hums,"
14555,"Hath rung night’s yawning peal, there shall be done"
14556,A deed of dreadful note.
14557,What’s to be done?
14558,"Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck,"
14559,"Till thou applaud the deed. Come, seeling night,"
14560,"Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day,"
14561,And with thy bloody and invisible hand
14562,Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond
14563,Which keeps me pale!—Light thickens; and the crow
14564,Makes wing to th’ rooky wood.
14565,"Good things of day begin to droop and drowse,"
14566,Whiles night’s black agents to their preys do rouse.
14567,Thou marvell’st at my words: but hold thee still;
14568,Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill.
14569,"So, pr’ythee, go with me."
14570,"SCENE III. The same. A Park or Lawn, with a gate leading to the Palace."
14571,But who did bid thee join with us?
14572,He needs not our mistrust; since he delivers
14573,Our offices and what we have to do
14574,To the direction just.
14575,Then stand with us.
14576,The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day.
14577,"Now spurs the lated traveller apace,"
14578,To gain the timely inn; and near approaches
14579,The subject of our watch.
14580,Hark! I hear horses.
14581,Then ’tis he; the rest
14582,That are within the note of expectation
14583,Already are i’ th’ court.
14584,His horses go about.
14585,"Almost a mile; but he does usually,"
14586,"So all men do, from hence to the palace gate"
14587,Make it their walk.
14588,Enter Banquo and Fleance with a torch.
14589,"A light, a light!"
14590,It will be rain tonight.
14591,Let it come down.
14592,"O, treachery! Fly, good Fleance, fly, fly, fly!"
14593,Thou mayst revenge—O slave!
14594,Who did strike out the light?
14595,Was’t not the way?
14596,There’s but one down: the son is fled.
14597,We have lost best half of our affair.
14598,"Well, let’s away, and say how much is done."
14599,SCENE IV. The same. A Room of state in the Palace.
14600,"A banquet prepared. Enter Macbeth, Lady Macbeth, Ross, Lennox, Lords"
14601,"You know your own degrees, sit down. At first"
14602,And last the hearty welcome.
14603,Thanks to your Majesty.
14604,"Ourself will mingle with society,"
14605,And play the humble host.
14606,"Our hostess keeps her state; but, in best time,"
14607,We will require her welcome.
14608,"Pronounce it for me, sir, to all our friends;"
14609,For my heart speaks they are welcome.
14610,Enter first Murderer to the door.
14611,"See, they encounter thee with their hearts’ thanks."
14612,Both sides are even: here I’ll sit i’ th’ midst.
14613,Be large in mirth; anon we’ll drink a measure
14614,The table round. There’s blood upon thy face.
14615,’Tis better thee without than he within.
14616,"My lord, his throat is cut. That I did for him."
14617,Thou art the best o’ th’ cut-throats;
14618,Yet he’s good that did the like for Fleance:
14619,"If thou didst it, thou art the nonpareil."
14620,Then comes my fit again: I had else been perfect;
14621,"Whole as the marble, founded as the rock,"
14622,As broad and general as the casing air:
14623,"But now I am cabin’d, cribb’d, confin’d, bound in"
14624,To saucy doubts and fears. But Banquo’s safe?
14625,"Ay, my good lord. Safe in a ditch he bides,"
14626,With twenty trenched gashes on his head;
14627,The least a death to nature.
14628,There the grown serpent lies; the worm that’s fled
14629,"Hath nature that in time will venom breed,"
14630,No teeth for th’ present.—Get thee gone; tomorrow
14631,"We’ll hear, ourselves, again."
14632,You do not give the cheer: the feast is sold
14633,"That is not often vouch’d, while ’tis a-making,"
14634,’Tis given with welcome. To feed were best at home;
14635,From thence the sauce to meat is ceremony;
14636,Meeting were bare without it.
14637,"The Ghost of Banquo rises, and sits in Macbeth’s place."
14638,"Now, good digestion wait on appetite,"
14639,And health on both!
14640,May’t please your Highness sit.
14641,"Here had we now our country’s honour roof’d,"
14642,Were the grac’d person of our Banquo present;
14643,Who may I rather challenge for unkindness
14644,Than pity for mischance!
14645,Lays blame upon his promise. Please’t your Highness
14646,To grace us with your royal company?
14647,"Here is a place reserv’d, sir."
14648,"Here, my good lord. What is’t that moves your Highness?"
14649,Which of you have done this?
14650,"What, my good lord?"
14651,Thou canst not say I did it. Never shake
14652,Thy gory locks at me.
14653,"Gentlemen, rise; his Highness is not well."
14654,"Sit, worthy friends. My lord is often thus,"
14655,"And hath been from his youth: pray you, keep seat;"
14656,The fit is momentary; upon a thought
14657,"He will again be well. If much you note him,"
14658,"You shall offend him, and extend his passion."
14659,"Feed, and regard him not.—Are you a man?"
14660,"Ay, and a bold one, that dare look on that"
14661,Which might appal the devil.
14662,This is the very painting of your fear:
14663,"This is the air-drawn dagger which you said,"
14664,"Led you to Duncan. O, these flaws, and starts"
14665,"A woman’s story at a winter’s fire,"
14666,Authoris’d by her grandam. Shame itself!
14667,"Why do you make such faces? When all’s done,"
14668,You look but on a stool.
14669,Behold! look! lo! how say you?
14670,"Why, what care I? If thou canst nod, speak too.—"
14671,If charnel houses and our graves must send
14672,"Those that we bury back, our monuments"
14673,Shall be the maws of kites.
14674,"What, quite unmann’d in folly?"
14675,"If I stand here, I saw him."
14676,"Blood hath been shed ere now, i’ th’ olden time,"
14677,Ere humane statute purg’d the gentle weal;
14678,"Ay, and since too, murders have been perform’d"
14679,"Too terrible for the ear: the time has been,"
14680,"That, when the brains were out, the man would die,"
14681,"And there an end; but now they rise again,"
14682,"With twenty mortal murders on their crowns,"
14683,And push us from our stools. This is more strange
14684,Than such a murder is.
14685,Your noble friends do lack you.
14686,"Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends."
14687,"I have a strange infirmity, which is nothing"
14688,"To those that know me. Come, love and health to all;"
14689,"Then I’ll sit down.—Give me some wine, fill full.—"
14690,"I drink to the general joy o’ th’ whole table,"
14691,"And to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss:"
14692,Would he were here.
14693,"To all, and him, we thirst,"
14694,And all to all.
14695,"Our duties, and the pledge."
14696,Avaunt! and quit my sight! let the earth hide thee!
14697,"Thy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold;"
14698,Thou hast no speculation in those eyes
14699,Which thou dost glare with!
14700,"Think of this, good peers,"
14701,"But as a thing of custom: ’tis no other,"
14702,Only it spoils the pleasure of the time.
14703,"What man dare, I dare:"
14704,"Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear,"
14705,"The arm’d rhinoceros, or th’ Hyrcan tiger;"
14706,"Take any shape but that, and my firm nerves"
14707,"Shall never tremble: or be alive again,"
14708,And dare me to the desert with thy sword;
14709,"If trembling I inhabit then, protest me"
14710,"The baby of a girl. Hence, horrible shadow!"
14711,"I am a man again.—Pray you, sit still."
14712,"You have displaced the mirth, broke the good meeting"
14713,With most admir’d disorder.
14714,"Can such things be,"
14715,"And overcome us like a summer’s cloud,"
14716,Without our special wonder? You make me strange
14717,"Even to the disposition that I owe,"
14718,"When now I think you can behold such sights,"
14719,"And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks,"
14720,When mine are blanch’d with fear.
14721,"What sights, my lord?"
14722,"I pray you, speak not; he grows worse and worse;"
14723,"Question enrages him. At once, good night:—"
14724,"Stand not upon the order of your going,"
14725,But go at once.
14726,Good night; and better health
14727,A kind good night to all!
14728,"It will have blood, they say, blood will have blood."
14729,"Stones have been known to move, and trees to speak;"
14730,"Augurs, and understood relations, have"
14731,"By magot-pies, and choughs, and rooks, brought forth"
14732,The secret’st man of blood.—What is the night?
14733,"Almost at odds with morning, which is which."
14734,"How say’st thou, that Macduff denies his person"
14735,At our great bidding?
14736,"Did you send to him, sir?"
14737,I hear it by the way; but I will send.
14738,There’s not a one of them but in his house
14739,I keep a servant fee’d. I will tomorrow
14740,"More shall they speak; for now I am bent to know,"
14741,"By the worst means, the worst. For mine own good,"
14742,All causes shall give way: I am in blood
14743,"Stepp’d in so far that, should I wade no more,"
14744,Returning were as tedious as go o’er.
14745,"Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,"
14746,Which must be acted ere they may be scann’d.
14747,"You lack the season of all natures, sleep."
14748,"Come, we’ll to sleep. My strange and self-abuse"
14749,Is the initiate fear that wants hard use.
14750,We are yet but young in deed.
14751,SCENE V. The heath.
14752,Thunder. Enter the three Witches meeting Hecate.
14753,"Why, how now, Hecate? you look angerly."
14754,"Have I not reason, beldams as you are,"
14755,Saucy and overbold? How did you dare
14756,To trade and traffic with Macbeth
14757,In riddles and affairs of death;
14758,"And I, the mistress of your charms,"
14759,"The close contriver of all harms,"
14760,"Was never call’d to bear my part,"
14761,Or show the glory of our art?
14762,"And, which is worse, all you have done"
14763,"Hath been but for a wayward son,"
14764,"Spiteful and wrathful; who, as others do,"
14765,"Loves for his own ends, not for you."
14766,"But make amends now: get you gone,"
14767,And at the pit of Acheron
14768,Meet me i’ th’ morning: thither he
14769,Will come to know his destiny.
14770,"Your vessels and your spells provide,"
14771,"Your charms, and everything beside."
14772,I am for th’ air; this night I’ll spend
14773,Unto a dismal and a fatal end.
14774,Great business must be wrought ere noon.
14775,Upon the corner of the moon
14776,There hangs a vap’rous drop profound;
14777,I’ll catch it ere it come to ground:
14778,"And that, distill’d by magic sleights,"
14779,"Shall raise such artificial sprites,"
14780,"As, by the strength of their illusion,"
14781,Shall draw him on to his confusion.
14782,"He shall spurn fate, scorn death, and bear"
14783,"His hopes ’bove wisdom, grace, and fear."
14784,"And you all know, security"
14785,Is mortals’ chiefest enemy.
14786,"Hark! I am call’d; my little spirit, see,"
14787,Sits in a foggy cloud and stays for me.
14788,"Come, let’s make haste; she’ll soon be back again."
14789,SCENE VI. Forres. A Room in the Palace.
14790,Enter Lennox and another Lord.
14791,"My former speeches have but hit your thoughts,"
14792,"Which can interpret farther: only, I say,"
14793,Thing’s have been strangely borne. The gracious Duncan
14794,"Was pitied of Macbeth:—marry, he was dead:—"
14795,And the right valiant Banquo walk’d too late;
14796,"Whom, you may say, if’t please you, Fleance kill’d,"
14797,For Fleance fled. Men must not walk too late.
14798,"Who cannot want the thought, how monstrous"
14799,It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain
14800,To kill their gracious father? damned fact!
14801,"How it did grieve Macbeth! did he not straight,"
14802,"In pious rage, the two delinquents tear"
14803,That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep?
14804,"Was not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely too;"
14805,"For ’twould have anger’d any heart alive,"
14806,"To hear the men deny’t. So that, I say,"
14807,"He has borne all things well: and I do think,"
14808,That had he Duncan’s sons under his key
14809,What ’twere to kill a father; so should Fleance.
14810,"But, peace!—for from broad words, and ’cause he fail’d"
14811,"His presence at the tyrant’s feast, I hear,"
14812,"Macduff lives in disgrace. Sir, can you tell"
14813,Where he bestows himself?
14814,"The son of Duncan,"
14815,"From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth,"
14816,Lives in the English court and is receiv’d
14817,Of the most pious Edward with such grace
14818,That the malevolence of fortune nothing
14819,Takes from his high respect. Thither Macduff
14820,"Is gone to pray the holy king, upon his aid"
14821,"To wake Northumberland, and warlike Siward"
14822,"That, by the help of these (with Him above"
14823,"To ratify the work), we may again"
14824,"Give to our tables meat, sleep to our nights;"
14825,"Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives,"
14826,"Do faithful homage, and receive free honours,"
14827,All which we pine for now. And this report
14828,Hath so exasperate the King that he
14829,Prepares for some attempt of war.
14830,Sent he to Macduff?
14831,"He did: and with an absolute “Sir, not I,”"
14832,"The cloudy messenger turns me his back,"
14833,"And hums, as who should say, “You’ll rue the time"
14834,That clogs me with this answer.”
14835,And that well might
14836,"Advise him to a caution, t’ hold what distance"
14837,His wisdom can provide. Some holy angel
14838,"Fly to the court of England, and unfold"
14839,"His message ere he come, that a swift blessing"
14840,May soon return to this our suffering country
14841,Under a hand accurs’d!
14842,I’ll send my prayers with him.
14843,"SCENE I. A dark Cave. In the middle, a Cauldron Boiling."
14844,Thunder. Enter the three Witches.
14845,Thrice the brinded cat hath mew’d.
14846,"Thrice, and once the hedge-pig whin’d."
14847,"Harpier cries:—’Tis time, ’tis time."
14848,Round about the cauldron go;
14849,In the poison’d entrails throw.—
14850,"Toad, that under cold stone"
14851,Days and nights has thirty-one
14852,"Swelter’d venom sleeping got,"
14853,Boil thou first i’ th’ charmed pot!
14854,"Double, double, toil and trouble;"
14855,"Fire, burn; and cauldron, bubble."
14856,"Fillet of a fenny snake,"
14857,In the cauldron boil and bake;
14858,"Eye of newt, and toe of frog,"
14859,"Wool of bat, and tongue of dog,"
14860,"Adder’s fork, and blind-worm’s sting,"
14861,"Lizard’s leg, and howlet’s wing,"
14862,"For a charm of powerful trouble,"
14863,Like a hell-broth boil and bubble.
14864,"Double, double, toil and trouble;"
14865,"Fire, burn; and cauldron, bubble."
14866,"Scale of dragon, tooth of wolf,"
14867,"Witch’s mummy, maw and gulf"
14868,"Of the ravin’d salt-sea shark,"
14869,"Root of hemlock digg’d i’ th’ dark,"
14870,"Liver of blaspheming Jew,"
14871,"Gall of goat, and slips of yew"
14872,"Sliver’d in the moon’s eclipse,"
14873,"Nose of Turk, and Tartar’s lips,"
14874,Finger of birth-strangled babe
14875,"Ditch-deliver’d by a drab,"
14876,Make the gruel thick and slab:
14877,"Add thereto a tiger’s chaudron,"
14878,For th’ ingredients of our cauldron.
14879,"Double, double, toil and trouble;"
14880,"Fire, burn; and cauldron, bubble."
14881,Cool it with a baboon’s blood.
14882,Then the charm is firm and good.
14883,"O, well done! I commend your pains,"
14884,And everyone shall share i’ th’ gains.
14885,"And now about the cauldron sing,"
14886,"Like elves and fairies in a ring,"
14887,Enchanting all that you put in.
14888,"By the pricking of my thumbs,"
14889,Something wicked this way comes.
14890,"How now, you secret, black, and midnight hags!"
14891,What is’t you do?
14892,A deed without a name.
14893,"I conjure you, by that which you profess,"
14894,"Though you untie the winds, and let them fight"
14895,Against the churches; though the yesty waves
14896,Confound and swallow navigation up;
14897,"Though bladed corn be lodg’d, and trees blown down;"
14898,Though castles topple on their warders’ heads;
14899,Though palaces and pyramids do slope
14900,Their heads to their foundations; though the treasure
14901,"Of nature’s germens tumble all together,"
14902,"Even till destruction sicken, answer me"
14903,To what I ask you.
14904,"Say, if thou’dst rather hear it from our mouths,"
14905,Or from our masters?
14906,"Call ’em, let me see ’em."
14907,"Pour in sow’s blood, that hath eaten"
14908,Her nine farrow; grease that’s sweaten
14909,From the murderer’s gibbet throw
14910,"Come, high or low;"
14911,Thyself and office deftly show!
14912,"Tell me, thou unknown power,—"
14913,He knows thy thought:
14914,"Hear his speech, but say thou naught."
14915,Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth! Beware Macduff;
14916,Beware the Thane of Fife.—Dismiss me.—Enough.
14917,"Whate’er thou art, for thy good caution, thanks;"
14918,Thou hast harp’d my fear aright.—But one word more.
14919,"He will not be commanded. Here’s another,"
14920,More potent than the first.
14921,"Had I three ears, I’d hear thee."
14922,"Be bloody, bold, and resolute. Laugh to scorn"
14923,"The power of man, for none of woman born"
14924,"Then live, Macduff: what need I fear of thee?"
14925,"But yet I’ll make assurance double sure,"
14926,And take a bond of fate. Thou shalt not live;
14927,"That I may tell pale-hearted fear it lies,"
14928,And sleep in spite of thunder.
14929,"[_Thunder. An Apparition of a Child crowned, with a tree in his hand,"
14930,"That rises like the issue of a king,"
14931,And wears upon his baby brow the round
14932,And top of sovereignty?
14933,"Listen, but speak not to’t."
14934,"Be lion-mettled, proud, and take no care"
14935,"Who chafes, who frets, or where conspirers are:"
14936,"Macbeth shall never vanquish’d be, until"
14937,Great Birnam wood to high Dunsinane hill
14938,Shall come against him.
14939,That will never be:
14940,Who can impress the forest; bid the tree
14941,"Unfix his earth-bound root? Sweet bodements, good!"
14942,"Rebellious head, rise never till the wood"
14943,"Of Birnam rise, and our high-plac’d Macbeth"
14944,"Shall live the lease of nature, pay his breath"
14945,To time and mortal custom.—Yet my heart
14946,"Throbs to know one thing: tell me, if your art"
14947,"Can tell so much, shall Banquo’s issue ever"
14948,Reign in this kingdom?
14949,Seek to know no more.
14950,"I will be satisfied: deny me this,"
14951,And an eternal curse fall on you! Let me know.
14952,Why sinks that cauldron? and what noise is this?
14953,"Show his eyes, and grieve his heart;"
14954,"Come like shadows, so depart!"
14955,"[_A show of eight kings appear, and pass over in order, the last with"
14956,a glass in his hand; Banquo following._]
14957,Thou are too like the spirit of Banquo. Down!
14958,"Thy crown does sear mine eyeballs:—and thy hair,"
14959,"Thou other gold-bound brow, is like the first."
14960,A third is like the former.—Filthy hags!
14961,"Why do you show me this?—A fourth!—Start, eyes!"
14962,"What, will the line stretch out to th’ crack of doom?"
14963,Another yet!—A seventh!—I’ll see no more:—
14964,"And yet the eighth appears, who bears a glass"
14965,Which shows me many more; and some I see
14966,That twofold balls and treble sceptres carry.
14967,Horrible sight!—Now I see ’tis true;
14968,"For the blood-bolter’d Banquo smiles upon me,"
14969,And points at them for his.—What! is this so?
14970,"Ay, sir, all this is so:—but why"
14971,Stands Macbeth thus amazedly?—
14972,"Come, sisters, cheer we up his sprites,"
14973,And show the best of our delights.
14974,"I’ll charm the air to give a sound,"
14975,While you perform your antic round;
14976,"That this great king may kindly say,"
14977,Our duties did his welcome pay.
14978,Where are they? Gone?—Let this pernicious hour
14979,Stand aye accursed in the calendar!—
14980,"Come in, without there!"
14981,What’s your Grace’s will?
14982,Saw you the Weird Sisters?
14983,Came they not by you?
14984,"No, indeed, my lord."
14985,Infected be the air whereon they ride;
14986,And damn’d all those that trust them!—I did hear
14987,The galloping of horse: who was’t came by?
14988,"’Tis two or three, my lord, that bring you word"
14989,Macduff is fled to England.
14990,"Ay, my good lord."
14991,"Time, thou anticipat’st my dread exploits:"
14992,The flighty purpose never is o’ertook
14993,Unless the deed go with it. From this moment
14994,The very firstlings of my heart shall be
14995,"The firstlings of my hand. And even now,"
14996,"To crown my thoughts with acts, be it thought and done:"
14997,The castle of Macduff I will surprise;
14998,Seize upon Fife; give to th’ edge o’ th’ sword
14999,"His wife, his babes, and all unfortunate souls"
15000,That trace him in his line. No boasting like a fool;
15001,This deed I’ll do before this purpose cool:
15002,But no more sights!—Where are these gentlemen?
15003,"Come, bring me where they are."
15004,SCENE II. Fife. A Room in Macduff’s Castle.
15005,Enter Lady Macduff her Son and Ross.
15006,"What had he done, to make him fly the land?"
15007,"You must have patience, madam."
15008,"His flight was madness: when our actions do not,"
15009,Our fears do make us traitors.
15010,Whether it was his wisdom or his fear.
15011,"Wisdom! to leave his wife, to leave his babes,"
15012,"His mansion, and his titles, in a place"
15013,From whence himself does fly? He loves us not:
15014,"He wants the natural touch; for the poor wren,"
15015,"The most diminutive of birds, will fight,"
15016,"Her young ones in her nest, against the owl."
15017,"All is the fear, and nothing is the love;"
15018,"As little is the wisdom, where the flight"
15019,So runs against all reason.
15020,"I pray you, school yourself: but, for your husband,"
15021,"He is noble, wise, judicious, and best knows"
15022,The fits o’ th’ season. I dare not speak much further:
15023,"But cruel are the times, when we are traitors,"
15024,And do not know ourselves; when we hold rumour
15025,"From what we fear, yet know not what we fear,"
15026,But float upon a wild and violent sea
15027,Each way and move—I take my leave of you:
15028,Shall not be long but I’ll be here again.
15029,"Things at the worst will cease, or else climb upward"
15030,"To what they were before.—My pretty cousin,"
15031,"Father’d he is, and yet he’s fatherless."
15032,"I am so much a fool, should I stay longer,"
15033,It would be my disgrace and your discomfort:
15034,I take my leave at once.
15035,"Sirrah, your father’s dead."
15036,And what will you do now? How will you live?
15037,"As birds do, mother."
15038,"What, with worms and flies?"
15039,"With what I get, I mean; and so do they."
15040,"Poor bird! thou’dst never fear the net nor lime,"
15041,The pit-fall nor the gin.
15042,"Why should I, mother? Poor birds they are not set for."
15043,"My father is not dead, for all your saying."
15044,"Yes, he is dead: how wilt thou do for a father?"
15045,"Nay, how will you do for a husband?"
15046,"Why, I can buy me twenty at any market."
15047,Then you’ll buy ’em to sell again.
15048,Thou speak’st with all thy wit;
15049,"And yet, i’ faith, with wit enough for thee."
15050,"Was my father a traitor, mother?"
15051,"Ay, that he was."
15052,What is a traitor?
15053,"Why, one that swears and lies."
15054,And be all traitors that do so?
15055,"Every one that does so is a traitor, and must be hanged."
15056,And must they all be hanged that swear and lie?
15057,Who must hang them?
15058,"Why, the honest men."
15059,Then the liars and swearers are fools: for there are liars and swearers
15060,enow to beat the honest men and hang up them.
15061,"Now, God help thee, poor monkey! But how wilt thou do for a father?"
15062,"If he were dead, you’ld weep for him: if you would not, it were a good"
15063,sign that I should quickly have a new father.
15064,"Poor prattler, how thou talk’st!"
15065,"Bless you, fair dame! I am not to you known,"
15066,Though in your state of honour I am perfect.
15067,I doubt some danger does approach you nearly:
15068,"If you will take a homely man’s advice,"
15069,"Be not found here; hence, with your little ones."
15070,"To fright you thus, methinks, I am too savage;"
15071,"To do worse to you were fell cruelty,"
15072,Which is too nigh your person. Heaven preserve you!
15073,I dare abide no longer.
15074,Whither should I fly?
15075,I have done no harm. But I remember now
15076,"I am in this earthly world, where to do harm"
15077,Is often laudable; to do good sometime
15078,"Accounted dangerous folly:  why then, alas,"
15079,"Do I put up that womanly defence,"
15080,To say I have done no harm? What are these faces?
15081,Where is your husband?
15082,"I hope, in no place so unsanctified"
15083,Where such as thou mayst find him.
15084,"Thou liest, thou shag-ear’d villain!"
15085,Young fry of treachery!
15086,"He has kill’d me, mother:"
15087,"Run away, I pray you!"
15088,"[_Dies. Exit Lady Macduff, crying “Murder!” and pursued by the"
15089,SCENE III. England. Before the King’s Palace.
15090,Enter Malcolm and Macduff.
15091,Let us seek out some desolate shade and there
15092,Weep our sad bosoms empty.
15093,"Hold fast the mortal sword, and, like good men,"
15094,Bestride our down-fall’n birthdom. Each new morn
15095,"New widows howl, new orphans cry; new sorrows"
15096,"Strike heaven on the face, that it resounds"
15097,"As if it felt with Scotland, and yell’d out"
15098,Like syllable of dolour.
15099,"What I believe, I’ll wail;"
15100,"What know, believe; and what I can redress,"
15101,"As I shall find the time to friend, I will."
15102,"What you have spoke, it may be so, perchance."
15103,"This tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,"
15104,Was once thought honest: you have loved him well;
15105,He hath not touch’d you yet. I am young; but something
15106,You may deserve of him through me; and wisdom
15107,"To offer up a weak, poor, innocent lamb"
15108,To appease an angry god.
15109,I am not treacherous.
15110,A good and virtuous nature may recoil
15111,In an imperial charge. But I shall crave your pardon.
15112,"That which you are, my thoughts cannot transpose."
15113,"Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell:"
15114,"Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace,"
15115,Yet grace must still look so.
15116,I have lost my hopes.
15117,Perchance even there where I did find my doubts.
15118,"Why in that rawness left you wife and child,"
15119,"Those precious motives, those strong knots of love,"
15120,"Without leave-taking?—I pray you,"
15121,"Let not my jealousies be your dishonours,"
15122,"But mine own safeties. You may be rightly just,"
15123,Whatever I shall think.
15124,"Bleed, bleed, poor country!"
15125,"Great tyranny, lay thou thy basis sure,"
15126,For goodness dare not check thee! wear thou thy wrongs;
15127,"The title is affeer’d.—Fare thee well, lord:"
15128,I would not be the villain that thou think’st
15129,For the whole space that’s in the tyrant’s grasp
15130,And the rich East to boot.
15131,I speak not as in absolute fear of you.
15132,I think our country sinks beneath the yoke;
15133,"It weeps, it bleeds; and each new day a gash"
15134,"Is added to her wounds. I think, withal,"
15135,There would be hands uplifted in my right;
15136,"And here, from gracious England, have I offer"
15137,"Of goodly thousands: but, for all this,"
15138,"When I shall tread upon the tyrant’s head,"
15139,"Or wear it on my sword, yet my poor country"
15140,"Shall have more vices than it had before,"
15141,"More suffer, and more sundry ways than ever,"
15142,By him that shall succeed.
15143,What should he be?
15144,It is myself I mean; in whom I know
15145,All the particulars of vice so grafted
15146,"That, when they shall be open’d, black Macbeth"
15147,Will seem as pure as snow; and the poor state
15148,"Esteem him as a lamb, being compar’d"
15149,With my confineless harms.
15150,Not in the legions
15151,Of horrid hell can come a devil more damn’d
15152,In evils to top Macbeth.
15153,"I grant him bloody,"
15154,"Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful,"
15155,"Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin"
15156,"That has a name: but there’s no bottom, none,"
15157,"In my voluptuousness: your wives, your daughters,"
15158,"Your matrons, and your maids, could not fill up"
15159,The cistern of my lust; and my desire
15160,"All continent impediments would o’erbear,"
15161,That did oppose my will: better Macbeth
15162,Than such an one to reign.
15163,In nature is a tyranny; it hath been
15164,"Th’ untimely emptying of the happy throne,"
15165,And fall of many kings. But fear not yet
15166,To take upon you what is yours: you may
15167,"Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,"
15168,And yet seem cold—the time you may so hoodwink.
15169,We have willing dames enough; there cannot be
15170,"That vulture in you, to devour so many"
15171,"As will to greatness dedicate themselves,"
15172,Finding it so inclin’d.
15173,With this there grows
15174,In my most ill-compos’d affection such
15175,"A staunchless avarice, that, were I king,"
15176,I should cut off the nobles for their lands;
15177,"Desire his jewels, and this other’s house:"
15178,And my more-having would be as a sauce
15179,To make me hunger more; that I should forge
15180,"Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal,"
15181,Destroying them for wealth.
15182,Sticks deeper; grows with more pernicious root
15183,Than summer-seeming lust; and it hath been
15184,The sword of our slain kings: yet do not fear;
15185,"Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will,"
15186,"Of your mere own. All these are portable,"
15187,With other graces weigh’d.
15188,"But I have none: the king-becoming graces,"
15189,"As justice, verity, temp’rance, stableness,"
15190,"Bounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness,"
15191,"Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude,"
15192,I have no relish of them; but abound
15193,"In the division of each several crime,"
15194,"Acting it many ways. Nay, had I power, I should"
15195,"Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell,"
15196,"Uproar the universal peace, confound"
15197,All unity on earth.
15198,"If such a one be fit to govern, speak:"
15199,I am as I have spoken.
15200,"No, not to live.—O nation miserable,"
15201,"With an untitled tyrant bloody-scepter’d,"
15202,"When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again,"
15203,Since that the truest issue of thy throne
15204,"By his own interdiction stands accus’d,"
15205,And does blaspheme his breed? Thy royal father
15206,"Was a most sainted king. The queen that bore thee,"
15207,"Oft’ner upon her knees than on her feet,"
15208,Died every day she lived. Fare thee well!
15209,These evils thou repeat’st upon thyself
15210,"Have banish’d me from Scotland.—O my breast,"
15211,Thy hope ends here!
15212,"Macduff, this noble passion,"
15213,"Child of integrity, hath from my soul"
15214,"Wiped the black scruples, reconcil’d my thoughts"
15215,To thy good truth and honour. Devilish Macbeth
15216,By many of these trains hath sought to win me
15217,"Into his power, and modest wisdom plucks me"
15218,From over-credulous haste: but God above
15219,Deal between thee and me! for even now
15220,"I put myself to thy direction, and"
15221,Unspeak mine own detraction; here abjure
15222,"The taints and blames I laid upon myself,"
15223,For strangers to my nature. I am yet
15224,Unknown to woman; never was forsworn;
15225,Scarcely have coveted what was mine own;
15226,At no time broke my faith; would not betray
15227,The devil to his fellow; and delight
15228,No less in truth than life: my first false speaking
15229,"Was this upon myself. What I am truly,"
15230,Is thine and my poor country’s to command:
15231,"Whither, indeed, before thy here-approach,"
15232,"Old Siward, with ten thousand warlike men,"
15233,"Already at a point, was setting forth."
15234,"Now we’ll together, and the chance of goodness"
15235,Be like our warranted quarrel. Why are you silent?
15236,Such welcome and unwelcome things at once
15237,’Tis hard to reconcile.
15238,"Well; more anon.—Comes the King forth, I pray you?"
15239,"Ay, sir. There are a crew of wretched souls"
15240,That stay his cure: their malady convinces
15241,"The great assay of art; but at his touch,"
15242,"Such sanctity hath heaven given his hand,"
15243,"I thank you, doctor."
15244,What’s the disease he means?
15245,’Tis call’d the evil:
15246,A most miraculous work in this good king;
15247,"Which often, since my here-remain in England,"
15248,"I have seen him do. How he solicits heaven,"
15249,"Himself best knows, but strangely-visited people,"
15250,"All swoln and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye,"
15251,"The mere despair of surgery, he cures;"
15252,"Hanging a golden stamp about their necks,"
15253,"Put on with holy prayers: and ’tis spoken,"
15254,To the succeeding royalty he leaves
15255,"The healing benediction. With this strange virtue,"
15256,He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy;
15257,"And sundry blessings hang about his throne,"
15258,That speak him full of grace.
15259,"See, who comes here?"
15260,My countryman; but yet I know him not.
15261,"My ever-gentle cousin, welcome hither."
15262,"I know him now. Good God, betimes remove"
15263,The means that makes us strangers!
15264,Stands Scotland where it did?
15265,Almost afraid to know itself! It cannot
15266,"Be call’d our mother, but our grave, where nothing,"
15267,"But who knows nothing, is once seen to smile;"
15268,"Where sighs, and groans, and shrieks, that rent the air,"
15269,"Are made, not mark’d; where violent sorrow seems"
15270,A modern ecstasy. The dead man’s knell
15271,Is there scarce ask’d for who; and good men’s lives
15272,"Expire before the flowers in their caps,"
15273,Dying or ere they sicken.
15274,"Too nice, and yet too true!"
15275,What’s the newest grief?
15276,That of an hour’s age doth hiss the speaker;
15277,Each minute teems a new one.
15278,How does my wife?
15279,And all my children?
15280,The tyrant has not batter’d at their peace?
15281,No; they were well at peace when I did leave ’em.
15282,Be not a niggard of your speech: how goes’t?
15283,"When I came hither to transport the tidings,"
15284,"Which I have heavily borne, there ran a rumour"
15285,Of many worthy fellows that were out;
15286,"Which was to my belief witness’d the rather,"
15287,For that I saw the tyrant’s power afoot.
15288,Now is the time of help. Your eye in Scotland
15289,"Would create soldiers, make our women fight,"
15290,To doff their dire distresses.
15291,We are coming thither. Gracious England hath
15292,Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men;
15293,An older and a better soldier none
15294,That Christendom gives out.
15295,Would I could answer
15296,This comfort with the like! But I have words
15297,"That would be howl’d out in the desert air,"
15298,Where hearing should not latch them.
15299,The general cause? or is it a fee-grief
15300,Due to some single breast?
15301,No mind that’s honest
15302,"But in it shares some woe, though the main part"
15303,Pertains to you alone.
15304,"If it be mine,"
15305,"Keep it not from me, quickly let me have it."
15306,"Let not your ears despise my tongue for ever,"
15307,Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound
15308,That ever yet they heard.
15309,Humh! I guess at it.
15310,Your castle is surpris’d; your wife and babes
15311,Savagely slaughter’d. To relate the manner
15312,"Were, on the quarry of these murder’d deer,"
15313,To add the death of you.
15314,"What, man! ne’er pull your hat upon your brows."
15315,Give sorrow words. The grief that does not speak
15316,"Whispers the o’er-fraught heart, and bids it break."
15317,"Wife, children, servants, all"
15318,That could be found.
15319,And I must be from thence!
15320,My wife kill’d too?
15321,"Let’s make us med’cines of our great revenge,"
15322,To cure this deadly grief.
15323,He has no children.—All my pretty ones?
15324,Did you say all?—O hell-kite!—All?
15325,"What, all my pretty chickens and their dam"
15326,At one fell swoop?
15327,Dispute it like a man.
15328,I shall do so;
15329,But I must also feel it as a man:
15330,"I cannot but remember such things were,"
15331,"That were most precious to me.—Did heaven look on,"
15332,"And would not take their part? Sinful Macduff,"
15333,"They were all struck for thee! Naught that I am,"
15334,"Not for their own demerits, but for mine,"
15335,Fell slaughter on their souls: heaven rest them now!
15336,Be this the whetstone of your sword. Let grief
15337,"Convert to anger; blunt not the heart, enrage it."
15338,"O, I could play the woman with mine eyes,"
15339,"And braggart with my tongue!—But, gentle heavens,"
15340,"Cut short all intermission; front to front,"
15341,Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself;
15342,"Within my sword’s length set him; if he ’scape,"
15343,Heaven forgive him too!
15344,This tune goes manly.
15345,"Come, go we to the King. Our power is ready;"
15346,Our lack is nothing but our leave. Macbeth
15347,"Is ripe for shaking, and the powers above"
15348,Put on their instruments. Receive what cheer you may;
15349,The night is long that never finds the day.
15350,SCENE I. Dunsinane. A Room in the Castle.
15351,Enter a Doctor of Physic and a Waiting-Gentlewoman.
15352,"I have two nights watched with you, but can perceive no truth in your"
15353,report. When was it she last walked?
15354,"Since his Majesty went into the field, I have seen her rise from her"
15355,"bed, throw her nightgown upon her, unlock her closet, take forth paper,"
15356,"fold it, write upon’t, read it, afterwards seal it, and again return to"
15357,bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep.
15358,"A great perturbation in nature, to receive at once the benefit of"
15359,"sleep, and do the effects of watching. In this slumbery agitation,"
15360,"besides her walking and other actual performances, what, at any time,"
15361,have you heard her say?
15362,"That, sir, which I will not report after her."
15363,You may to me; and ’tis most meet you should.
15364,Neither to you nor anyone; having no witness to confirm my speech.
15365,Enter Lady Macbeth with a taper.
15366,"Lo you, here she comes! This is her very guise; and, upon my life, fast"
15367,asleep. Observe her; stand close.
15368,How came she by that light?
15369,"Why, it stood by her: she has light by her continually; ’tis her"
15370,"You see, her eyes are open."
15371,"Ay, but their sense are shut."
15372,What is it she does now? Look how she rubs her hands.
15373,"It is an accustomed action with her, to seem thus washing her hands. I"
15374,have known her continue in this a quarter of an hour.
15375,Yet here’s a spot.
15376,"Hark, she speaks. I will set down what comes from her, to satisfy my"
15377,remembrance the more strongly.
15378,"Out, damned spot! out, I say! One; two. Why, then ’tis time to do’t."
15379,"Hell is murky! Fie, my lord, fie! a soldier, and afeard? What need we"
15380,"fear who knows it, when none can call our power to account? Yet who"
15381,would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him?
15382,Do you mark that?
15383,"The Thane of Fife had a wife. Where is she now?—What, will these hands"
15384,"ne’er be clean? No more o’ that, my lord, no more o’ that: you mar all"
15385,"Go to, go to. You have known what you should not."
15386,"She has spoke what she should not, I am sure of that: heaven knows what"
15387,Here’s the smell of the blood still: all the perfumes of Arabia will
15388,"not sweeten this little hand. Oh, oh, oh!"
15389,What a sigh is there! The heart is sorely charged.
15390,I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the dignity of the whole
15391,"Pray God it be, sir."
15392,This disease is beyond my practice: yet I have known those which have
15393,"walked in their sleep, who have died holily in their beds."
15394,"Wash your hands, put on your nightgown; look not so pale. I tell you"
15395,"yet again, Banquo’s buried; he cannot come out on’s grave."
15396,"To bed, to bed. There’s knocking at the gate. Come, come, come, come,"
15397,"give me your hand. What’s done cannot be undone. To bed, to bed, to"
15398,Will she go now to bed?
15399,Foul whisp’rings are abroad. Unnatural deeds
15400,Do breed unnatural troubles: infected minds
15401,To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets.
15402,More needs she the divine than the physician.—
15403,"God, God, forgive us all! Look after her;"
15404,"Remove from her the means of all annoyance,"
15405,"And still keep eyes upon her. So, good night:"
15406,"My mind she has mated, and amaz’d my sight."
15407,"I think, but dare not speak."
15408,"Good night, good doctor."
15409,SCENE II. The Country near Dunsinane.
15410,"Enter, with drum and colours Menteith, Caithness, Angus, Lennox and"
15411,"The English power is near, led on by Malcolm,"
15412,"His uncle Siward, and the good Macduff."
15413,Revenges burn in them; for their dear causes
15414,Would to the bleeding and the grim alarm
15415,Excite the mortified man.
15416,Shall we well meet them. That way are they coming.
15417,Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother?
15418,"For certain, sir, he is not. I have a file"
15419,Of all the gentry: there is Siward’s son
15420,"And many unrough youths, that even now"
15421,Protest their first of manhood.
15422,What does the tyrant?
15423,Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies.
15424,"Some say he’s mad; others, that lesser hate him,"
15425,"Do call it valiant fury: but, for certain,"
15426,He cannot buckle his distemper’d cause
15427,Within the belt of rule.
15428,Now does he feel
15429,His secret murders sticking on his hands;
15430,Now minutely revolts upbraid his faith-breach;
15431,"Those he commands move only in command,"
15432,Nothing in love: now does he feel his title
15433,"Hang loose about him, like a giant’s robe"
15434,Upon a dwarfish thief.
15435,"Who, then, shall blame"
15436,"His pester’d senses to recoil and start,"
15437,When all that is within him does condemn
15438,Itself for being there?
15439,"Well, march we on,"
15440,To give obedience where ’tis truly ow’d:
15441,Meet we the med’cine of the sickly weal;
15442,"And with him pour we, in our country’s purge,"
15443,Each drop of us.
15444,Or so much as it needs
15445,"To dew the sovereign flower, and drown the weeds."
15446,Make we our march towards Birnam.
15447,SCENE III. Dunsinane. A Room in the Castle.
15448,"Enter Macbeth, Doctor and Attendants."
15449,Bring me no more reports; let them fly all:
15450,Till Birnam wood remove to Dunsinane
15451,I cannot taint with fear. What’s the boy Malcolm?
15452,Was he not born of woman? The spirits that know
15453,All mortal consequences have pronounc’d me thus:
15454,"“Fear not, Macbeth; no man that’s born of woman"
15455,"Shall e’er have power upon thee.”—Then fly, false thanes,"
15456,And mingle with the English epicures:
15457,"The mind I sway by, and the heart I bear,"
15458,Shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear.
15459,"The devil damn thee black, thou cream-fac’d loon!"
15460,Where gott’st thou that goose look?
15461,There is ten thousand—
15462,"Go prick thy face and over-red thy fear,"
15463,"Thou lily-liver’d boy. What soldiers, patch?"
15464,Death of thy soul! those linen cheeks of thine
15465,"Are counsellors to fear. What soldiers, whey-face?"
15466,"The English force, so please you."
15467,Take thy face hence.
15468,"Seyton!—I am sick at heart,"
15469,"When I behold—Seyton, I say!—This push"
15470,Will cheer me ever or disseat me now.
15471,I have liv’d long enough: my way of life
15472,"Is fall’n into the sere, the yellow leaf;"
15473,"And that which should accompany old age,"
15474,"As honour, love, obedience, troops of friends,"
15475,"I must not look to have; but, in their stead,"
15476,"Curses, not loud but deep, mouth-honour, breath,"
15477,"Which the poor heart would fain deny, and dare not."
15478,What’s your gracious pleasure?
15479,"All is confirm’d, my lord, which was reported."
15480,I’ll fight till from my bones my flesh be hack’d.
15481,Give me my armour.
15482,’Tis not needed yet.
15483,I’ll put it on.
15484,"Send out more horses, skirr the country round;"
15485,Hang those that talk of fear. Give me mine armour.—
15486,"How does your patient, doctor?"
15487,"Not so sick, my lord,"
15488,"As she is troubled with thick-coming fancies,"
15489,That keep her from her rest.
15490,Cure her of that:
15491,"Canst thou not minister to a mind diseas’d,"
15492,"Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow,"
15493,"Raze out the written troubles of the brain,"
15494,And with some sweet oblivious antidote
15495,Cleanse the stuff’d bosom of that perilous stuff
15496,Which weighs upon the heart?
15497,Must minister to himself.
15498,"Throw physic to the dogs, I’ll none of it."
15499,"Come, put mine armour on; give me my staff:"
15500,"Seyton, send out.—Doctor, the Thanes fly from me.—"
15501,"Come, sir, despatch.—If thou couldst, doctor, cast"
15502,"The water of my land, find her disease,"
15503,"And purge it to a sound and pristine health,"
15504,"I would applaud thee to the very echo,"
15505,"That should applaud again.—Pull’t off, I say.—"
15506,"What rhubarb, senna, or what purgative drug,"
15507,Would scour these English hence? Hear’st thou of them?
15508,"Ay, my good lord. Your royal preparation"
15509,Makes us hear something.
15510,Bring it after me.—
15511,"I will not be afraid of death and bane,"
15512,Till Birnam forest come to Dunsinane.
15513,"Were I from Dunsinane away and clear,"
15514,Profit again should hardly draw me here.
15515,SCENE IV. Country near Dunsinane: a Wood in view.
15516,"Enter, with drum and colours Malcolm, old Siward and his Son, Macduff,"
15517,"Menteith, Caithness, Angus, Lennox, Ross and Soldiers, marching."
15518,"Cousins, I hope the days are near at hand"
15519,That chambers will be safe.
15520,We doubt it nothing.
15521,What wood is this before us?
15522,The wood of Birnam.
15523,"Let every soldier hew him down a bough,"
15524,And bear’t before him. Thereby shall we shadow
15525,"The numbers of our host, and make discovery"
15526,Err in report of us.
15527,It shall be done.
15528,We learn no other but the confident tyrant
15529,"Keeps still in Dunsinane, and will endure"
15530,Our setting down before’t.
15531,’Tis his main hope;
15532,"For where there is advantage to be given,"
15533,"Both more and less have given him the revolt,"
15534,"And none serve with him but constrained things,"
15535,Whose hearts are absent too.
15536,Let our just censures
15537,"Attend the true event, and put we on"
15538,That will with due decision make us know
15539,"What we shall say we have, and what we owe."
15540,"Thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate,"
15541,But certain issue strokes must arbitrate;
15542,Towards which advance the war.
15543,SCENE V. Dunsinane. Within the castle.
15544,"Enter with drum and colours, Macbeth, Seyton and Soldiers."
15545,Hang out our banners on the outward walls;
15546,"The cry is still, “They come!” Our castle’s strength"
15547,Will laugh a siege to scorn: here let them lie
15548,Till famine and the ague eat them up.
15549,"Were they not forc’d with those that should be ours,"
15550,"We might have met them dareful, beard to beard,"
15551,And beat them backward home.
15552,What is that noise?
15553,"It is the cry of women, my good lord."
15554,I have almost forgot the taste of fears.
15555,"The time has been, my senses would have cool’d"
15556,To hear a night-shriek; and my fell of hair
15557,Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir
15558,As life were in’t. I have supp’d full with horrors;
15559,"Direness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts,"
15560,Cannot once start me.
15561,Wherefore was that cry?
15562,"The Queen, my lord, is dead."
15563,She should have died hereafter.
15564,There would have been a time for such a word.
15565,"Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow,"
15566,"Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,"
15567,To the last syllable of recorded time;
15568,And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
15569,"The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!"
15570,"Life’s but a walking shadow; a poor player,"
15571,"That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,"
15572,And then is heard no more: it is a tale
15573,"Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,"
15574,Thou com’st to use thy tongue; thy story quickly.
15575,"I should report that which I say I saw,"
15576,But know not how to do’t.
15577,"As I did stand my watch upon the hill,"
15578,"I look’d toward Birnam, and anon, methought,"
15579,The wood began to move.
15580,"Let me endure your wrath, if’t be not so."
15581,Within this three mile may you see it coming;
15582,"I say, a moving grove."
15583,"If thou speak’st false,"
15584,"Upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive,"
15585,"Till famine cling thee: if thy speech be sooth,"
15586,I care not if thou dost for me as much.—
15587,I pull in resolution; and begin
15588,"To doubt th’ equivocation of the fiend,"
15589,"That lies like truth. “Fear not, till Birnam wood"
15590,Do come to Dunsinane;” and now a wood
15591,"Comes toward Dunsinane.—Arm, arm, and out!—"
15592,"If this which he avouches does appear,"
15593,There is nor flying hence nor tarrying here.
15594,"I ’gin to be aweary of the sun,"
15595,And wish th’ estate o’ th’ world were now undone.—
15596,"Ring the alarum bell!—Blow, wind! come, wrack!"
15597,At least we’ll die with harness on our back.
15598,SCENE VI. The same. A Plain before the Castle.
15599,"Enter, with drum and colours, Malcolm, old Siward, Macduff and their"
15600,"Now near enough. Your leafy screens throw down,"
15601,"And show like those you are.—You, worthy uncle,"
15602,"Shall with my cousin, your right noble son,"
15603,Lead our first battle: worthy Macduff and we
15604,"Shall take upon’s what else remains to do,"
15605,According to our order.
15606,"Do we but find the tyrant’s power tonight,"
15607,"Let us be beaten, if we cannot fight."
15608,"Make all our trumpets speak; give them all breath,"
15609,Those clamorous harbingers of blood and death.
15610,SCENE VII. The same. Another part of the Plain.
15611,"They have tied me to a stake. I cannot fly,"
15612,"But, bear-like I must fight the course.—What’s he"
15613,That was not born of woman? Such a one
15614,"Am I to fear, or none."
15615,What is thy name?
15616,Thou’lt be afraid to hear it.
15617,No; though thou call’st thyself a hotter name
15618,Than any is in hell.
15619,The devil himself could not pronounce a title
15620,More hateful to mine ear.
15621,"No, nor more fearful."
15622,"Thou liest, abhorred tyrant. With my sword"
15623,I’ll prove the lie thou speak’st.
15624,Thou wast born of woman.
15625,"But swords I smile at, weapons laugh to scorn,"
15626,Brandish’d by man that’s of a woman born.
15627,"That way the noise is.—Tyrant, show thy face!"
15628,"If thou be’st slain and with no stroke of mine,"
15629,My wife and children’s ghosts will haunt me still.
15630,"I cannot strike at wretched kerns, whose arms"
15631,"Are hired to bear their staves. Either thou, Macbeth,"
15632,"Or else my sword, with an unbatter’d edge,"
15633,I sheathe again undeeded. There thou shouldst be;
15634,"By this great clatter, one of greatest note"
15635,"Seems bruited. Let me find him, Fortune!"
15636,And more I beg not.
15637,Enter Malcolm and old Siward.
15638,"This way, my lord;—the castle’s gently render’d:"
15639,The tyrant’s people on both sides do fight;
15640,"The noble thanes do bravely in the war,"
15641,"The day almost itself professes yours,"
15642,And little is to do.
15643,We have met with foes
15644,That strike beside us.
15645,"Enter, sir, the castle."
15646,SCENE VIII. The same. Another part of the field.
15647,"Why should I play the Roman fool, and die"
15648,"On mine own sword? whiles I see lives, the gashes"
15649,Do better upon them.
15650,Of all men else I have avoided thee:
15651,But get thee back; my soul is too much charg’d
15652,With blood of thine already.
15653,I have no words;
15654,My voice is in my sword: thou bloodier villain
15655,Than terms can give thee out!
15656,As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air
15657,"With thy keen sword impress, as make me bleed:"
15658,Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests;
15659,"I bear a charmed life, which must not yield"
15660,To one of woman born.
15661,And let the angel whom thou still hast serv’d
15662,"Tell thee, Macduff was from his mother’s womb"
15663,"Accursed be that tongue that tells me so,"
15664,For it hath cow’d my better part of man!
15665,"And be these juggling fiends no more believ’d,"
15666,That palter with us in a double sense;
15667,"That keep the word of promise to our ear,"
15668,And break it to our hope!—I’ll not fight with thee.
15669,"Then yield thee, coward,"
15670,And live to be the show and gaze o’ th’ time.
15671,"We’ll have thee, as our rarer monsters are,"
15672,"Painted upon a pole, and underwrit,"
15673,“Here may you see the tyrant.”
15674,"I will not yield,"
15675,"To kiss the ground before young Malcolm’s feet,"
15676,And to be baited with the rabble’s curse.
15677,"Though Birnam wood be come to Dunsinane,"
15678,"And thou oppos’d, being of no woman born,"
15679,Yet I will try the last. Before my body
15680,"I throw my warlike shield: lay on, Macduff;"
15681,"And damn’d be him that first cries, “Hold, enough!”"
15682,"Retreat. Flourish. Enter, with drum and colours, Malcolm, old Siward,"
15683,"Ross, Thanes and Soldiers."
15684,I would the friends we miss were safe arriv’d.
15685,"Some must go off; and yet, by these I see,"
15686,So great a day as this is cheaply bought.
15687,"Macduff is missing, and your noble son."
15688,"Your son, my lord, has paid a soldier’s debt:"
15689,He only liv’d but till he was a man;
15690,The which no sooner had his prowess confirm’d
15691,"In the unshrinking station where he fought,"
15692,But like a man he died.
15693,Then he is dead?
15694,"Ay, and brought off the field. Your cause of sorrow"
15695,"Must not be measur’d by his worth, for then"
15696,It hath no end.
15697,Had he his hurts before?
15698,"Ay, on the front."
15699,"Why then, God’s soldier be he!"
15700,"Had I as many sons as I have hairs,"
15701,I would not wish them to a fairer death:
15702,And so his knell is knoll’d.
15703,"He’s worth more sorrow,"
15704,And that I’ll spend for him.
15705,He’s worth no more.
15706,They say he parted well and paid his score:
15707,"And so, God be with him!—Here comes newer comfort."
15708,Enter Macduff with Macbeth’s head.
15709,"Hail, King, for so thou art. Behold, where stands"
15710,Th’ usurper’s cursed head: the time is free.
15711,"I see thee compass’d with thy kingdom’s pearl,"
15712,That speak my salutation in their minds;
15713,"Whose voices I desire aloud with mine,—"
15714,"Hail, King of Scotland!"
15715,"Hail, King of Scotland!"
15716,We shall not spend a large expense of time
15717,"Before we reckon with your several loves,"
15718,"And make us even with you. My thanes and kinsmen,"
15719,"Henceforth be earls, the first that ever Scotland"
15720,"In such an honour nam’d. What’s more to do,"
15721,"Which would be planted newly with the time,—"
15722,"As calling home our exil’d friends abroad,"
15723,That fled the snares of watchful tyranny;
15724,Producing forth the cruel ministers
15725,"Of this dead butcher, and his fiend-like queen,"
15726,"Who, as ’tis thought, by self and violent hands"
15727,"Took off her life;—this, and what needful else"
15728,"That calls upon us, by the grace of Grace,"
15729,"We will perform in measure, time, and place."
15730,"So thanks to all at once, and to each one,"
15731,Whom we invite to see us crown’d at Scone.

15752,"VARRIUS, a Gentleman, Servant to the Duke"
15753,"ANGELO, Deputy to the Duke"

15762,"Lords, Officers, Servants, Citizens and Attendants"
15763,SCENE I. An apartment in the Duke’s palace.
15764,"Enter Duke, Escalus, Lords and Attendants."
15765,Of government the properties to unfold
15766,"Would seem in me t’ affect speech and discourse,"
15767,Since I am put to know that your own science
15768,"Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice"
15769,My strength can give you. Then no more remains
15770,"But that, to your sufficiency, as your worth is able,"
15771,"And let them work. The nature of our people,"
15772,"Our city’s institutions, and the terms"
15773,"For common justice, you’re as pregnant in"
15774,As art and practice hath enriched any
15775,"That we remember. There is our commission,"
15776,"From which we would not have you warp.—Call hither,"
15777,"I say, bid come before us, Angelo."
15778,What figure of us think you he will bear?
15779,For you must know we have with special soul
15780,Elected him our absence to supply;
15781,"Lent him our terror, drest him with our love,"
15782,And given his deputation all the organs
15783,Of our own power. What think you of it?
15784,If any in Vienna be of worth
15785,"To undergo such ample grace and honour,"
15786,It is Lord Angelo.
15787,Look where he comes.
15788,"Always obedient to your Grace’s will,"
15789,I come to know your pleasure.
15790,There is a kind of character in thy life
15791,That to th’ observer doth thy history
15792,Fully unfold. Thyself and thy belongings
15793,Are not thine own so proper as to waste
15794,"Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee."
15795,"Heaven doth with us as we with torches do,"
15796,Not light them for themselves; for if our virtues
15797,"Did not go forth of us, ’twere all alike"
15798,As if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touched
15799,But to fine issues; nor nature never lends
15800,The smallest scruple of her excellence
15801,"But, like a thrifty goddess, she determines"
15802,"Herself the glory of a creditor,"
15803,Both thanks and use. But I do bend my speech
15804,To one that can my part in him advertise.
15805,In our remove be thou at full ourself.
15806,Mortality and mercy in Vienna
15807,"Live in thy tongue and heart. Old Escalus,"
15808,"Though first in question, is thy secondary."
15809,"Now, good my lord,"
15810,"Let there be some more test made of my metal,"
15811,Before so noble and so great a figure
15812,Be stamped upon it.
15813,We have with a leavened and prepared choice
15814,Proceeded to you; therefore take your honours.
15815,Our haste from hence is of so quick condition
15816,"That it prefers itself, and leaves unquestioned"
15817,"Matters of needful value. We shall write to you,"
15818,"As time and our concernings shall importune,"
15819,How it goes with us; and do look to know
15820,"What doth befall you here. So, fare you well."
15821,To th’ hopeful execution do I leave you
15822,"Yet give leave, my lord,"
15823,That we may bring you something on the way.
15824,My haste may not admit it;
15825,"Nor need you, on mine honour, have to do"
15826,"With any scruple. Your scope is as mine own,"
15827,So to enforce or qualify the laws
15828,As to your soul seems good. Give me your hand;
15829,"I’ll privily away. I love the people,"
15830,But do not like to stage me to their eyes.
15831,"Though it do well, I do not relish well"
15832,Their loud applause and _Aves_ vehement;
15833,Nor do I think the man of safe discretion
15834,"That does affect it. Once more, fare you well."
15835,The heavens give safety to your purposes!
15836,Lead forth and bring you back in happiness.
15837,I thank you. Fare you well.
15838,"I shall desire you, sir, to give me leave"
15839,To have free speech with you; and it concerns me
15840,To look into the bottom of my place.
15841,"A power I have, but of what strength and nature"
15842,I am not yet instructed.
15843,"’Tis so with me. Let us withdraw together,"
15844,And we may soon our satisfaction have
15845,I’ll wait upon your honour.
15846,SCENE II. A street.
15847,Enter Lucio and two other Gentlemen.
15848,"If the Duke, with the other dukes, come not to composition with the"
15849,"King of Hungary, why then all the dukes fall upon the King."
15850,"Heaven grant us its peace, but not the King of Hungary’s!"
15851,Thou conclud’st like the sanctimonious pirate that went to sea with the
15852,"ten commandments, but scraped one out of the table."
15853,“Thou shalt not steal”?
15854,"Ay, that he razed."
15855,"Why, ’twas a commandment to command the captain and all the rest from"
15856,their functions! They put forth to steal. There’s not a soldier of us
15857,"all that, in the thanksgiving before meat, do relish the petition well"
15858,that prays for peace.
15859,I never heard any soldier dislike it.
15860,I believe thee; for I think thou never wast where grace was said.
15861,No? A dozen times at least.
15862,In any proportion or in any language.
15863,"I think, or in any religion."
15864,"Ay, why not? Grace is grace, despite of all controversy; as, for"
15865,"example, thou thyself art a wicked villain, despite of all grace."
15866,"Well, there went but a pair of shears between us."
15867,"I grant, as there may between the lists and the velvet. Thou art the"
15868,"And thou the velvet. Thou art good velvet; thou’rt a three-piled piece,"
15869,I warrant thee. I had as lief be a list of an English kersey as be
15870,"piled, as thou art piled, for a French velvet. Do I speak feelingly"
15871,"I think thou dost, and indeed, with most painful feeling of thy speech."
15872,"I will, out of thine own confession, learn to begin thy health; but,"
15873,"whilst I live, forget to drink after thee."
15874,"I think I have done myself wrong, have I not?"
15875,"Yes, that thou hast, whether thou art tainted or free."
15876,"Enter Mistress Overdone, a Bawd."
15877,"Behold, behold, where Madam Mitigation comes! I have purchased as many"
15878,diseases under her roof as come to—
15879,"To what, I pray?"
15880,To three thousand dolours a year.
15881,A French crown more.
15882,"Thou art always figuring diseases in me, but thou art full of error; I"
15883,"Nay, not, as one would say, healthy, but so sound as things that are"
15884,hollow. Thy bones are hollow. Impiety has made a feast of thee.
15885,"How now, which of your hips has the most profound sciatica?"
15886,"Well, well! There’s one yonder arrested and carried to prison was worth"
15887,five thousand of you all.
15888,"Who’s that, I pray thee?"
15889,"Marry, sir, that’s Claudio, Signior Claudio."
15890,Claudio to prison? ’Tis not so.
15891,"Nay, but I know ’tis so. I saw him arrested, saw him carried away; and,"
15892,"which is more, within these three days his head to be chopped off."
15893,"But, after all this fooling, I would not have it so. Art thou sure of"
15894,I am too sure of it. And it is for getting Madam Julietta with child.
15895,"Believe me, this may be. He promised to meet me two hours since, and he"
15896,was ever precise in promise-keeping.
15897,"Besides, you know, it draws something near to the speech we had to such"
15898,But most of all agreeing with the proclamation.
15899,Away! Let’s go learn the truth of it.
15900,"Thus, what with the war, what with the sweat, what with the gallows,"
15901,"and what with poverty, I am custom-shrunk."
15902,How now? What’s the news with you?
15903,Yonder man is carried to prison.
15904,"Well, what has he done?"
15905,But what’s his offence?
15906,Groping for trouts in a peculiar river.
15907,What? Is there a maid with child by him?
15908,"No, but there’s a woman with maid by him. You have not heard of the"
15909,All houses in the suburbs of Vienna must be plucked down.
15910,And what shall become of those in the city?
15911,"They shall stand for seed. They had gone down too, but that a wise"
15912,burgher put in for them.
15913,But shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs be pulled down?
15914,"To the ground, mistress."
15915,"Why, here’s a change indeed in the commonwealth! What shall become of"
15916,"Come, fear not you. Good counsellors lack no clients. Though you change"
15917,"your place, you need not change your trade. I’ll be your tapster still."
15918,"Courage, there will be pity taken on you. You that have worn your eyes"
15919,"almost out in the service, you will be considered."
15920,"Enter Provost, Claudio, Juliet and Officers."
15921,"What’s to do here, Thomas Tapster? Let’s withdraw."
15922,"Here comes Signior Claudio, led by the Provost to prison. And there’s"
15923,"Fellow, why dost thou show me thus to the world?"
15924,"Bear me to prison, where I am committed."
15925,"I do it not in evil disposition,"
15926,But from Lord Angelo by special charge.
15927,Thus can the demi-god Authority
15928,Make us pay down for our offence by weight.
15929,"The words of heaven; on whom it will, it will;"
15930,"On whom it will not, so; yet still ’tis just."
15931,Enter Lucio and two Gentlemen.
15932,"Why, how now, Claudio? Whence comes this restraint?"
15933,"From too much liberty, my Lucio, liberty."
15934,"As surfeit is the father of much fast,"
15935,So every scope by the immoderate use
15936,"Turns to restraint. Our natures do pursue,"
15937,"Like rats that ravin down their proper bane,"
15938,"A thirsty evil; and when we drink, we die."
15939,"If I could speak so wisely under an arrest, I would send for certain of"
15940,"my creditors; and yet, to say the truth, I had as lief have the foppery"
15941,"of freedom as the morality of imprisonment. What’s thy offence,"
15942,What but to speak of would offend again.
15943,"Away, sir; you must go."
15944,"One word, good friend.—Lucio, a word with you."
15945,"A hundred, if they’ll do you any good. Is lechery so looked after?"
15946,Thus stands it with me: upon a true contract
15947,I got possession of Julietta’s bed.
15948,"You know the lady; she is fast my wife,"
15949,Save that we do the denunciation lack
15950,Of outward order. This we came not to
15951,Only for propagation of a dower
15952,"Remaining in the coffer of her friends,"
15953,From whom we thought it meet to hide our love
15954,Till time had made them for us. But it chances
15955,The stealth of our most mutual entertainment
15956,With character too gross is writ on Juliet.
15957,And the new deputy now for the Duke—
15958,"Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness,"
15959,Or whether that the body public be
15960,"A horse whereon the governor doth ride,"
15961,"Who, newly in the seat, that it may know"
15962,"He can command, lets it straight feel the spur;"
15963,"Whether the tyranny be in his place,"
15964,"Or in his eminence that fills it up,"
15965,I stagger in—but this new governor
15966,Awakes me all the enrolled penalties
15967,"Which have, like unscoured armour, hung by th’ wall"
15968,"So long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round,"
15969,And none of them been worn; and for a name
15970,Now puts the drowsy and neglected act
15971,Freshly on me. ’Tis surely for a name.
15972,I warrant it is. And thy head stands so tickle on thy shoulders that a
15973,"milkmaid, if she be in love, may sigh it off. Send after the Duke, and"
15974,"I have done so, but he’s not to be found."
15975,"I prithee, Lucio, do me this kind service:"
15976,"This day my sister should the cloister enter,"
15977,And there receive her approbation.
15978,Acquaint her with the danger of my state;
15979,"Implore her, in my voice, that she make friends"
15980,To the strict deputy; bid herself assay him.
15981,I have great hope in that. For in her youth
15982,There is a prone and speechless dialect
15983,"Such as moves men; beside, she hath prosperous art"
15984,"When she will play with reason and discourse,"
15985,And well she can persuade.
15986,"I pray she may, as well for the encouragement of the like, which else"
15987,"would stand under grievous imposition, as for the enjoying of thy life,"
15988,who I would be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at a game of
15989,tick-tack. I’ll to her.
15990,"I thank you, good friend Lucio."
15991,SCENE III. A monastery.
15992,Enter Duke and Friar Thomas.
15993,"No, holy father, throw away that thought;"
15994,Believe not that the dribbling dart of love
15995,Can pierce a complete bosom. Why I desire thee
15996,To give me secret harbour hath a purpose
15997,More grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends
15998,May your Grace speak of it?
15999,"My holy sir, none better knows than you"
16000,"How I have ever loved the life removed,"
16001,And held in idle price to haunt assemblies
16002,"Where youth, and cost, a witless bravery keeps."
16003,"I have delivered to Lord Angelo,"
16004,"A man of stricture and firm abstinence,"
16005,"My absolute power and place here in Vienna,"
16006,And he supposes me travelled to Poland;
16007,"For so I have strewed it in the common ear,"
16008,"And so it is received. Now, pious sir,"
16009,You will demand of me why I do this?
16010,"We have strict statutes and most biting laws,"
16011,"The needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds,"
16012,"Which for this fourteen years we have let slip,"
16013,Even like an o’ergrown lion in a cave
16014,"That goes not out to prey. Now, as fond fathers,"
16015,"Having bound up the threat’ning twigs of birch,"
16016,Only to stick it in their children’s sight
16017,"For terror, not to use, in time the rod"
16018,"Becomes more mocked than feared: so our decrees,"
16019,"Dead to infliction, to themselves are dead,"
16020,"And liberty plucks justice by the nose,"
16021,"The baby beats the nurse, and quite athwart"
16022,It rested in your Grace
16023,To unloose this tied-up justice when you pleased;
16024,And it in you more dreadful would have seemed
16025,Than in Lord Angelo.
16026,"I do fear, too dreadful."
16027,"Sith ’twas my fault to give the people scope,"
16028,’Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them
16029,For what I bid them do; for we bid this be done
16030,When evil deeds have their permissive pass
16031,"And not the punishment. Therefore, indeed, my father,"
16032,I have on Angelo imposed the office;
16033,"Who may in th’ ambush of my name strike home,"
16034,And yet my nature never in the fight
16035,"To do in slander. And to behold his sway,"
16036,"I will, as ’twere a brother of your order,"
16037,"Visit both prince and people. Therefore, I prithee,"
16038,"Supply me with the habit, and instruct me"
16039,How I may formally in person bear
16040,Like a true friar. Moe reasons for this action
16041,At our more leisure shall I render you;
16042,"Only, this one: Lord Angelo is precise;"
16043,Stands at a guard with envy; scarce confesses
16044,That his blood flows or that his appetite
16045,"Is more to bread than stone. Hence shall we see,"
16046,"If power change purpose, what our seemers be."
16047,SCENE IV. A nunnery.
16048,"Enter Isabella and Francisca, a Nun."
16049,And have you nuns no farther privileges?
16050,Are not these large enough?
16051,"Yes, truly; I speak not as desiring more,"
16052,But rather wishing a more strict restraint
16053,"Upon the sisterhood, the votarists of Saint Clare."
16054,Who’s that which calls?
16055,"It is a man’s voice. Gentle Isabella,"
16056,"Turn you the key, and know his business of him;"
16057,"You may, I may not; you are yet unsworn."
16058,"When you have vowed, you must not speak with men"
16059,But in the presence of the prioress;
16060,"Then, if you speak, you must not show your face;"
16061,"Or if you show your face, you must not speak."
16062,He calls again. I pray you answer him.
16063,Peace and prosperity! Who is’t that calls?
16064,"Hail, virgin, if you be, as those cheek-roses"
16065,Proclaim you are no less. Can you so stead me
16066,"As bring me to the sight of Isabella,"
16067,"A novice of this place, and the fair sister"
16068,To her unhappy brother Claudio?
16069,"Why “her unhappy brother”? let me ask,"
16070,The rather for I now must make you know
16071,"I am that Isabella, and his sister."
16072,"Gentle and fair, your brother kindly greets you."
16073,"Not to be weary with you, he’s in prison."
16074,Woe me! For what?
16075,"For that which, if myself might be his judge,"
16076,He should receive his punishment in thanks:
16077,He hath got his friend with child.
16078,"Sir, make me not your story."
16079,"I would not, though ’tis my familiar sin"
16080,"With maids to seem the lapwing, and to jest,"
16081,"Tongue far from heart, play with all virgins so."
16082,I hold you as a thing enskied and sainted
16083,"By your renouncement an immortal spirit,"
16084,"And to be talked with in sincerity,"
16085,As with a saint.
16086,You do blaspheme the good in mocking me.
16087,"Do not believe it. Fewness and truth, ’tis thus:"
16088,Your brother and his lover have embraced;
16089,"As those that feed grow full, as blossoming time"
16090,That from the seedness the bare fallow brings
16091,"To teeming foison, even so her plenteous womb"
16092,Expresseth his full tilth and husbandry.
16093,Someone with child by him? My cousin Juliet?
16094,Is she your cousin?
16095,"Adoptedly, as school-maids change their names"
16096,By vain though apt affection.
16097,"O, let him marry her!"
16098,This is the point.
16099,The Duke is very strangely gone from hence;
16100,"Bore many gentlemen, myself being one,"
16101,"In hand, and hope of action; but we do learn,"
16102,"By those that know the very nerves of state,"
16103,His givings-out were of an infinite distance
16104,"From his true-meant design. Upon his place,"
16105,"And with full line of his authority,"
16106,Governs Lord Angelo; a man whose blood
16107,Is very snow-broth; one who never feels
16108,The wanton stings and motions of the sense;
16109,But doth rebate and blunt his natural edge
16110,"With profits of the mind, study and fast."
16111,"He, to give fear to use and liberty,"
16112,Which have for long run by the hideous law
16113,"As mice by lions, hath picked out an act,"
16114,Under whose heavy sense your brother’s life
16115,"Falls into forfeit. He arrests him on it,"
16116,And follows close the rigour of the statute
16117,"To make him an example. All hope is gone,"
16118,Unless you have the grace by your fair prayer
16119,To soften Angelo. And that’s my pith of business
16120,’Twixt you and your poor brother.
16121,Has censured him already;
16122,"And, as I hear, the Provost hath a warrant"
16123,"Alas, what poor ability’s in me"
16124,To do him good?
16125,Assay the power you have.
16126,"My power? Alas, I doubt."
16127,"Our doubts are traitors,"
16128,And make us lose the good we oft might win
16129,"By fearing to attempt. Go to Lord Angelo,"
16130,"And let him learn to know, when maidens sue,"
16131,"Men give like gods; but when they weep and kneel,"
16132,All their petitions are as freely theirs
16133,As they themselves would owe them.
16134,I’ll see what I can do.
16135,I will about it straight;
16136,No longer staying but to give the Mother
16137,Notice of my affair. I humbly thank you.
16138,Commend me to my brother. Soon at night
16139,I’ll send him certain word of my success.
16140,I take my leave of you.
16141,SCENE I. A hall in Angelo’s house.
16142,"Enter Angelo, Escalus, Servants, and a Justice."
16143,"We must not make a scarecrow of the law,"
16144,"Setting it up to fear the birds of prey,"
16145,And let it keep one shape till custom make it
16146,"Their perch, and not their terror."
16147,"Let us be keen, and rather cut a little"
16148,"Than fall and bruise to death. Alas, this gentleman,"
16149,"Whom I would save, had a most noble father."
16150,"Let but your honour know,"
16151,"Whom I believe to be most strait in virtue,"
16152,"That, in the working of your own affections,"
16153,"Had time cohered with place, or place with wishing,"
16154,Or that the resolute acting of your blood
16155,"Could have attained th’ effect of your own purpose,"
16156,Whether you had not sometime in your life
16157,"Erred in this point which now you censure him,"
16158,And pulled the law upon you.
16159,"’Tis one thing to be tempted, Escalus,"
16160,Another thing to fall. I not deny
16161,The jury passing on the prisoner’s life
16162,May in the sworn twelve have a thief or two
16163,"Guiltier than him they try. What’s open made to justice,"
16164,That justice seizes. What knows the laws
16165,"That thieves do pass on thieves? ’Tis very pregnant,"
16166,"The jewel that we find, we stoop and take ’t,"
16167,"Because we see it; but what we do not see,"
16168,"We tread upon, and never think of it."
16169,You may not so extenuate his offence
16170,"For I have had such faults; but rather tell me,"
16171,"When I that censure him do so offend,"
16172,"Let mine own judgement pattern out my death,"
16173,"And nothing come in partial. Sir, he must die."
16174,Be it as your wisdom will.
16175,Where is the Provost?
16176,"Here, if it like your honour."
16177,Be executed by nine tomorrow morning.
16178,"Bring him his confessor, let him be prepared,"
16179,For that’s the utmost of his pilgrimage.
16180,"Well, heaven forgive him; and forgive us all."
16181,"Some rise by sin, and some by virtue fall."
16182,"Some run from brakes of vice, and answer none,"
16183,And some condemned for a fault alone.
16184,Enter Elbow and Officers with Froth and Pompey.
16185,"Come, bring them away. If these be good people in a commonweal that do"
16186,"nothing but use their abuses in common houses, I know no law. Bring"
16187,"How now, sir, what’s your name? And what’s the matter?"
16188,"If it please your honour, I am the poor Duke’s constable, and my name"
16189,"is Elbow. I do lean upon justice, sir, and do bring in here before your"
16190,good honour two notorious benefactors.
16191,"Benefactors? Well, what benefactors are they? Are they not malefactors?"
16192,"If it please your honour, I know not well what they are, but precise"
16193,"villains they are, that I am sure of, and void of all profanation in"
16194,the world that good Christians ought to have.
16195,This comes off well. Here’s a wise officer.
16196,Go to. What quality are they of? Elbow is your name? Why dost thou not
16197,"He cannot, sir. He’s out at elbow."
16198,"What are you, sir?"
16199,"He, sir? A tapster, sir; parcel bawd; one that serves a bad woman;"
16200,"whose house, sir, was, as they say, plucked down in the suburbs; and"
16201,"now she professes a hot-house, which, I think is a very ill house too."
16202,How know you that?
16203,"My wife, sir, whom I detest before heaven and your honour—"
16204,"Ay, sir, whom I thank heaven is an honest woman—"
16205,Dost thou detest her therefore?
16206,"I say, sir, I will detest myself also, as well as she, that this house,"
16207,"if it be not a bawd’s house, it is pity of her life, for it is a"
16208,"How dost thou know that, constable?"
16209,"Marry, sir, by my wife, who, if she had been a woman cardinally given,"
16210,"might have been accused in fornication, adultery, and all uncleanliness"
16211,By the woman’s means?
16212,"Ay, sir, by Mistress Overdone’s means; but as she spit in his face, so"
16213,"Sir, if it please your honour, this is not so."
16214,"Prove it before these varlets here, thou honourable man, prove it."
16215,"Sir, she came in great with child; and longing, saving your honour’s"
16216,"reverence, for stewed prunes; sir, we had but two in the house, which"
16217,"at that very distant time stood, as it were, in a fruit dish, a dish of"
16218,some threepence; your honours have seen such dishes; they are not china
16219,"dishes, but very good dishes—"
16220,"Go to, go to. No matter for the dish, sir."
16221,"No, indeed, sir, not of a pin; you are therein in the right. But to the"
16222,"point. As I say, this Mistress Elbow, being, as I say, with child, and"
16223,"being great-bellied, and longing, as I said, for prunes; and having but"
16224,"two in the dish, as I said, Master Froth here, this very man, having"
16225,"eaten the rest, as I said, and, as I say, paying for them very"
16226,"honestly; for, as you know, Master Froth, I could not give you"
16227,"Very well. You being then, if you be remembered, cracking the stones of"
16228,"Ay, so I did indeed."
16229,"Why, very well. I telling you then, if you be remembered, that such a"
16230,"one and such a one were past cure of the thing you wot of, unless they"
16231,"kept very good diet, as I told you—"
16232,All this is true.
16233,"Why, very well then—"
16234,"Come, you are a tedious fool. To the purpose. What was done to Elbow’s"
16235,wife that he hath cause to complain of? Come me to what was done to
16236,"Sir, your honour cannot come to that yet."
16237,"No, sir, nor I mean it not."
16238,"Sir, but you shall come to it, by your honour’s leave. And I beseech"
16239,"you, look into Master Froth here, sir, a man of fourscore pound a year;"
16240,"whose father died at Hallowmas—was’t not at Hallowmas, Master Froth?"
16241,"Why, very well. I hope here be truths. He, sir, sitting, as I say, in a"
16242,"lower chair, sir—’twas in the Bunch of Grapes, where, indeed, you have"
16243,"a delight to sit, have you not?"
16244,"I have so, because it is an open room, and good for winter."
16245,"Why, very well then. I hope here be truths."
16246,This will last out a night in Russia
16247,"When nights are longest there. I’ll take my leave,"
16248,And leave you to the hearing of the cause;
16249,Hoping you’ll find good cause to whip them all.
16250,I think no less. Good morrow to your lordship.
16251,"Now, sir, come on. What was done to Elbow’s wife, once more?"
16252,"Once, sir? There was nothing done to her once."
16253,"I beseech you, sir, ask him what this man did to my wife."
16254,"I beseech your honour, ask me."
16255,"Well, sir, what did this gentleman to her?"
16256,"I beseech you, sir, look in this gentleman’s face. Good Master Froth,"
16257,look upon his honour; ’tis for a good purpose.—Doth your honour mark
16258,"Ay, sir, very well."
16259,"Nay, I beseech you, mark it well."
16260,"Well, I do so."
16261,Doth your honour see any harm in his face?
16262,"I’ll be supposed upon a book, his face is the worst thing about him."
16263,"Good, then, if his face be the worst thing about him, how could Master"
16264,Froth do the constable’s wife any harm? I would know that of your
16265,He’s in the right. Constable. What say you to it?
16266,"First, an it like you, the house is a respected house; next, this is a"
16267,respected fellow; and his mistress is a respected woman.
16268,"By this hand, sir, his wife is a more respected person than any of us"
16269,"Varlet, thou liest; thou liest, wicked varlet! The time is yet to come"
16270,"that she was ever respected with man, woman, or child."
16271,"Sir, she was respected with him before he married with her."
16272,"Which is the wiser here, Justice or Iniquity? Is this true?"
16273,O thou caitiff! O thou varlet! O thou wicked Hannibal! I respected with
16274,"her before I was married to her? If ever I was respected with her, or"
16275,"she with me, let not your worship think me the poor Duke’s officer."
16276,"Prove this, thou wicked Hannibal, or I’ll have mine action of battery"
16277,"If he took you a box o’ th’ ear, you might have your action of slander"
16278,"Marry, I thank your good worship for it. What is’t your worship’s"
16279,pleasure I shall do with this wicked caitiff?
16280,"Truly, officer, because he hath some offences in him that thou wouldst"
16281,"discover if thou couldst, let him continue in his courses till thou"
16282,know’st what they are.
16283,"Marry, I thank your worship for it.—Thou seest, thou wicked varlet,"
16284,"now, what’s come upon thee. Thou art to continue now, thou varlet, thou"
16285,"Here in Vienna, sir."
16286,Are you of fourscore pounds a year?
16287,"Yes, an’t please you, sir."
16288,"So. [_To Pompey_.] What trade are you of, sir?"
16289,"A tapster, a poor widow’s tapster."
16290,Hath she had any more than one husband?
16291,"Nine, sir; Overdone by the last."
16292,"Nine?—Come hither to me, Master Froth. Master Froth, I would not have"
16293,"you acquainted with tapsters; they will draw you, Master Froth, and you"
16294,"will hang them. Get you gone, and let me hear no more of you."
16295,"I thank your worship. For mine own part, I never come into any room in"
16296,a taphouse but I am drawn in.
16297,"Well, no more of it, Master Froth. Farewell."
16298,"Come you hither to me, Master tapster. What’s your name, Master"
16299,"Troth, and your bum is the greatest thing about you; so that, in the"
16300,"beastliest sense, you are Pompey the great. Pompey, you are partly a"
16301,"bawd, Pompey, howsoever you colour it in being a tapster, are you not?"
16302,"Come, tell me true, it shall be the better for you."
16303,"Truly, sir, I am a poor fellow that would live."
16304,"How would you live, Pompey? By being a bawd? What do you think of the"
16305,"trade, Pompey? Is it a lawful trade?"
16306,"If the law would allow it, sir."
16307,"But the law will not allow it, Pompey; nor it shall not be allowed in"
16308,Does your worship mean to geld and splay all the youth of the city?
16309,"Truly, sir, in my poor opinion, they will to’t then. If your worship"
16310,"will take order for the drabs and the knaves, you need not to fear the"
16311,"There is pretty orders beginning, I can tell you. It is but heading and"
16312,If you head and hang all that offend that way but for ten year
16313,"together, you’ll be glad to give out a commission for more heads. If"
16314,"this law hold in Vienna ten year, I’ll rent the fairest house in it"
16315,"after threepence a bay. If you live to see this come to pass, say"
16316,Pompey told you so.
16317,"Thank you, good Pompey; and, in requital of your prophecy, hark you: I"
16318,"advise you, let me not find you before me again upon any complaint"
16319,"whatsoever; no, not for dwelling where you do. If I do, Pompey, I shall"
16320,"beat you to your tent, and prove a shrewd Caesar to you. In plain"
16321,"dealing, Pompey, I shall have you whipped. So for this time, Pompey,"
16322,I thank your worship for your good counsel. [_Aside_.] But I shall
16323,follow it as the flesh and fortune shall better determine.
16324,"Whip me? No, no; let carman whip his jade;"
16325,The valiant heart’s not whipped out of his trade.
16326,"Come hither to me, Master Elbow. Come hither, Master Constable. How"
16327,long have you been in this place of constable?
16328,"Seven year and a half, sir."
16329,"I thought, by the readiness in the office, you had continued in it"
16330,sometime. You say seven years together?
16331,"And a half, sir."
16332,"Alas, it hath been great pains to you. They do you wrong to put you so"
16333,oft upon’t. Are there not men in your ward sufficient to serve it?
16334,"Faith, sir, few of any wit in such matters. As they are chosen, they"
16335,"are glad to choose me for them; I do it for some piece of money, and go"
16336,"Look you bring me in the names of some six or seven, the most"
16337,sufficient of your parish.
16338,"To your worship’s house, sir?"
16339,To my house. Fare you well.
16340,"What’s o’clock, think you?"
16341,I pray you home to dinner with me.
16342,I humbly thank you.
16343,"It grieves me for the death of Claudio,"
16344,But there’s no remedy.
16345,Lord Angelo is severe.
16346,It is but needful.
16347,Mercy is not itself that oft looks so;
16348,Pardon is still the nurse of second woe.
16349,"But yet, Poor Claudio! There’s no remedy."
16350,SCENE II. Another room in the same.
16351,Enter Provost and a Servant.
16352,He’s hearing of a cause. He will come straight.
16353,I’ll tell him of you.
16354,"His pleasure, may be he will relent. Alas,"
16355,He hath but as offended in a dream;
16356,"All sects, all ages, smack of this vice, and he"
16357,To die for ’t!
16358,"Now, what’s the matter, Provost?"
16359,Is it your will Claudio shall die tomorrow?
16360,Did not I tell thee yea? Hadst thou not order?
16361,Why dost thou ask again?
16362,Lest I might be too rash.
16363,"Under your good correction, I have seen"
16364,"When, after execution, judgement hath"
16365,Repented o’er his doom.
16366,Go to; let that be mine.
16367,"Do you your office, or give up your place,"
16368,And you shall well be spared.
16369,I crave your honour’s pardon.
16370,"What shall be done, sir, with the groaning Juliet?"
16371,She’s very near her hour.
16372,To some more fitter place; and that with speed.
16373,Here is the sister of the man condemned
16374,Desires access to you.
16375,Hath he a sister?
16376,"Ay, my good lord, a very virtuous maid,"
16377,"And to be shortly of a sisterhood,"
16378,"Well, let her be admitted."
16379,See you the fornicatress be removed;
16380,Let her have needful but not lavish means;
16381,There shall be order for it.
16382,Enter Lucio and Isabella.
16383,Stay a little while. [_To Isabella_.] You are welcome. What’s your
16384,"I am a woeful suitor to your honour,"
16385,Please but your honour hear me.
16386,"Well, what’s your suit?"
16387,"There is a vice that most I do abhor,"
16388,And most desire should meet the blow of justice;
16389,"For which I would not plead, but that I must;"
16390,"For which I must not plead, but that I am"
16391,At war ’twixt will and will not.
16392,I have a brother is condemned to die;
16393,"I do beseech you, let it be his fault,"
16394,And not my brother.
16395,Heaven give thee moving graces.
16396,"Condemn the fault, and not the actor of it?"
16397,"Why, every fault’s condemned ere it be done."
16398,Mine were the very cipher of a function
16399,"To find the faults whose fine stands in record,"
16400,And let go by the actor.
16401,O just but severe law!
16402,"I had a brother, then. Heaven keep your honour!"
16403,"Kneel down before him, hang upon his gown;"
16404,"You are too cold. If you should need a pin,"
16405,You could not with more tame a tongue desire it.
16406,"To him, I say."
16407,Must he needs die?
16408,"Yes, I do think that you might pardon him,"
16409,And neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy.
16410,I will not do’t.
16411,But can you if you would?
16412,"Look, what I will not, that I cannot do."
16413,"But might you do’t, and do the world no wrong,"
16414,If so your heart were touched with that remorse
16415,As mine is to him?
16416,"He’s sentenced, ’tis too late."
16417,"Too late? Why, no. I that do speak a word"
16418,"May call it back again. Well, believe this:"
16419,"No ceremony that to great ones longs,"
16420,"Not the king’s crown, nor the deputed sword,"
16421,"The marshal’s truncheon, nor the judge’s robe,"
16422,Become them with one half so good a grace
16423,"If he had been as you, and you as he,"
16424,"You would have slipped like him, but he like you"
16425,Would not have been so stern.
16426,Pray you be gone.
16427,"I would to heaven I had your potency,"
16428,And you were Isabel! Should it then be thus?
16429,No; I would tell what ’twere to be a judge
16430,And what a prisoner.
16431,"Your brother is a forfeit of the law,"
16432,And you but waste your words.
16433,"Why, all the souls that were were forfeit once,"
16434,And He that might the vantage best have took
16435,Found out the remedy. How would you be
16436,"If He, which is the top of judgement, should"
16437,"But judge you as you are? O, think on that,"
16438,"And mercy then will breathe within your lips,"
16439,Like man new made.
16440,"Be you content, fair maid."
16441,"It is the law, not I, condemns your brother."
16442,"Were he my kinsman, brother, or my son,"
16443,It should be thus with him. He must die tomorrow.
16444,"Tomorrow? O, that’s sudden! Spare him, spare him!"
16445,He’s not prepared for death. Even for our kitchens
16446,We kill the fowl of season. Shall we serve heaven
16447,With less respect than we do minister
16448,"To our gross selves? Good, good my lord, bethink you."
16449,Who is it that hath died for this offence?
16450,There’s many have committed it.
16451,"The law hath not been dead, though it hath slept."
16452,Those many had not dared to do that evil
16453,If the first that did th’ edict infringe
16454,"Had answered for his deed. Now ’tis awake,"
16455,"Takes note of what is done, and, like a prophet,"
16456,"Looks in a glass that shows what future evils,"
16457,"Either now, or by remissness new conceived,"
16458,"And so in progress to be hatched and born,"
16459,"Are now to have no successive degrees,"
16460,"But, where they live, to end."
16461,Yet show some pity.
16462,I show it most of all when I show justice;
16463,"For then I pity those I do not know,"
16464,"Which a dismissed offence would after gall,"
16465,"And do him right that, answering one foul wrong,"
16466,Lives not to act another. Be satisfied;
16467,Your brother dies tomorrow; be content.
16468,"So you must be the first that gives this sentence,"
16469,"And he that suffers. O, it is excellent"
16470,To have a giant’s strength; but it is tyrannous
16471,To use it like a giant.
16472,Could great men thunder
16473,"As Jove himself does, Jove would ne’er be quiet,"
16474,For every pelting petty officer
16475,Would use his heaven for thunder.
16476,"Nothing but thunder. Merciful Heaven,"
16477,Thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt
16478,"Splits the unwedgeable and gnarled oak,"
16479,"Than the soft myrtle. But man, proud man,"
16480,"Dressed in a little brief authority,"
16481,"Most ignorant of what he’s most assured,"
16482,"His glassy essence, like an angry ape"
16483,Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven
16484,"As makes the angels weep; who, with our spleens,"
16485,Would all themselves laugh mortal.
16486,"O, to him, to him, wench! He will relent;"
16487,He’s coming. I perceive ’t.
16488,Pray heaven she win him.
16489,We cannot weigh our brother with ourself.
16490,"Great men may jest with saints; ’tis wit in them,"
16491,"But in the less, foul profanation."
16492,"Thou’rt i’ th’ right, girl; more o’ that."
16493,That in the captain’s but a choleric word
16494,Which in the soldier is flat blasphemy.
16495,Art advised o’ that? More on’t.
16496,Why do you put these sayings upon me?
16497,"Because authority, though it err like others,"
16498,Hath yet a kind of medicine in itself
16499,"That skins the vice o’ th’ top. Go to your bosom,"
16500,"Knock there, and ask your heart what it doth know"
16501,That’s like my brother’s fault. If it confess
16502,"A natural guiltiness such as is his,"
16503,Let it not sound a thought upon your tongue
16504,Against my brother’s life.
16505,"She speaks, and ’tis such sense"
16506,That my sense breeds with it. [_Going_.]
16507,"Gentle my lord, turn back."
16508,I will bethink me. Come again tomorrow.
16509,"Hark how I’ll bribe you. Good my lord, turn back."
16510,"Ay, with such gifts that heaven shall share with you."
16511,You had marred all else.
16512,"Not with fond shekels of the tested gold,"
16513,"Or stones, whose rates are either rich or poor"
16514,"As fancy values them, but with true prayers,"
16515,That shall be up at heaven and enter there
16516,"Ere sunrise, prayers from preserved souls,"
16517,"From fasting maids, whose minds are dedicate"
16518,Well; come to me tomorrow.
16519,Heaven keep your honour safe.
16520,"For I am that way going to temptation,"
16521,At what hour tomorrow
16522,Shall I attend your lordship?
16523,At any time ’fore noon.
16524,"From thee, even from thy virtue!"
16525,What’s this? What’s this? Is this her fault or mine?
16526,"The tempter or the tempted, who sins most, ha?"
16527,Not she; nor doth she tempt; but it is I
16528,"That, lying by the violet in the sun,"
16529,"Do as the carrion does, not as the flower,"
16530,Corrupt with virtuous season. Can it be
16531,That modesty may more betray our sense
16532,"Than woman’s lightness? Having waste ground enough,"
16533,Shall we desire to raze the sanctuary
16534,"And pitch our evils there? O, fie, fie, fie!"
16535,"What dost thou, or what art thou, Angelo?"
16536,Dost thou desire her foully for those things
16537,"That make her good? O, let her brother live."
16538,Thieves for their robbery have authority
16539,"When judges steal themselves. What, do I love her,"
16540,That I desire to hear her speak again
16541,And feast upon her eyes? What is’t I dream on?
16542,"O cunning enemy, that, to catch a saint,"
16543,With saints dost bait thy hook! Most dangerous
16544,Is that temptation that doth goad us on
16545,To sin in loving virtue. Never could the strumpet
16546,"With all her double vigour, art, and nature,"
16547,"Once stir my temper, but this virtuous maid"
16548,Subdues me quite. Ever till now
16549,"When men were fond, I smiled and wondered how."
16550,SCENE III. A room in a prison.
16551,"Enter Duke disguised as a Friar, and Provost."
16552,"Hail to you, Provost, so I think you are."
16553,"I am the Provost. What’s your will, good friar?"
16554,"Bound by my charity and my blessed order,"
16555,I come to visit the afflicted spirits
16556,Here in the prison. Do me the common right
16557,"To let me see them, and to make me know"
16558,"The nature of their crimes, that I may minister"
16559,"I would do more than that, if more were needful."
16560,"Look, here comes one, a gentlewoman of mine,"
16561,"Who, falling in the flaws of her own youth,"
16562,"Hath blistered her report. She is with child,"
16563,"And he that got it, sentenced: a young man"
16564,More fit to do another such offence
16565,Than die for this.
16566,When must he die?
16567,"As I do think, tomorrow."
16568,And you shall be conducted.
16569,"Repent you, fair one, of the sin you carry?"
16570,I do; and bear the shame most patiently.
16571,"I’ll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience,"
16572,"And try your penitence, if it be sound"
16573,Or hollowly put on.
16574,Love you the man that wronged you?
16575,"Yes, as I love the woman that wronged him."
16576,So then it seems your most offenceful act
16577,Then was your sin of heavier kind than his.
16578,"I do confess it, and repent it, father."
16579,"’Tis meet so, daughter; but lest you do repent"
16580,"As that the sin hath brought you to this shame,"
16581,"Which sorrow is always toward ourselves, not heaven,"
16582,"Showing we would not spare heaven as we love it,"
16583,But as we stand in fear—
16584,"I do repent me as it is an evil,"
16585,And take the shame with joy.
16586,"Your partner, as I hear, must die tomorrow,"
16587,And I am going with instruction to him.
16588,Grace go with you! _Benedicite!_
16589,"Must die tomorrow? O, injurious love"
16590,"That respites me a life, whose very comfort"
16591,Is still a dying horror!
16592,’Tis pity of him.
16593,SCENE IV. A room in Angelo’s house.
16594,"When I would pray and think, I think and pray"
16595,"To several subjects. Heaven hath my empty words,"
16596,"Whilst my invention, hearing not my tongue,"
16597,"Anchors on Isabel. Heaven in my mouth,"
16598,"As if I did but only chew his name,"
16599,And in my heart the strong and swelling evil
16600,Of my conception. The state whereon I studied
16601,"Is, like a good thing being often read,"
16602,"Grown sere and tedious; yea, my gravity,"
16603,"Wherein—let no man hear me—I take pride,"
16604,Could I with boot change for an idle plume
16605,"Which the air beats for vain. O place, O form,"
16606,"How often dost thou with thy case, thy habit,"
16607,"Wrench awe from fools, and tie the wiser souls"
16608,"To thy false seeming! Blood, thou art blood."
16609,Let’s write good angel on the devil’s horn.
16610,’Tis not the devil’s crest.
16611,"How now, who’s there?"
16612,"One Isabel, a sister, desires access to you."
16613,Teach her the way.
16614,"Why does my blood thus muster to my heart,"
16615,Making both it unable for itself
16616,And dispossessing all my other parts
16617,"So play the foolish throngs with one that swoons,"
16618,"Come all to help him, and so stop the air"
16619,By which he should revive. And even so
16620,The general subject to a well-wished king
16621,"Quit their own part, and in obsequious fondness"
16622,"Crowd to his presence, where their untaught love"
16623,Must needs appear offence.
16624,"How now, fair maid?"
16625,I am come to know your pleasure.
16626,"That you might know it, would much better please me"
16627,Than to demand what ’tis. Your brother cannot live.
16628,Even so. Heaven keep your honour.
16629,"Yet may he live a while. And, it may be,"
16630,As long as you or I. Yet he must die.
16631,"When, I beseech you? That in his reprieve,"
16632,"Longer or shorter, he may be so fitted"
16633,That his soul sicken not.
16634,"Ha! Fie, these filthy vices! It were as good"
16635,To pardon him that hath from nature stolen
16636,"A man already made, as to remit"
16637,Their saucy sweetness that do coin heaven’s image
16638,In stamps that are forbid. ’Tis all as easy
16639,Falsely to take away a life true made
16640,As to put metal in restrained means
16641,To make a false one.
16642,"’Tis set down so in heaven, but not in earth."
16643,Say you so? Then I shall pose you quickly.
16644,"Which had you rather, that the most just law"
16645,"Now took your brother’s life; or, to redeem him,"
16646,Give up your body to such sweet uncleanness
16647,As she that he hath stained?
16648,I had rather give my body than my soul.
16649,I talk not of your soul. Our compelled sins
16650,Stand more for number than for accompt.
16651,"Nay, I’ll not warrant that, for I can speak"
16652,Against the thing I say. Answer to this:
16653,"I, now the voice of the recorded law,"
16654,Pronounce a sentence on your brother’s life.
16655,Might there not be a charity in sin
16656,To save this brother’s life?
16657,"Please you to do’t,"
16658,I’ll take it as a peril to my soul;
16659,"It is no sin at all, but charity."
16660,"Pleased you to do’t at peril of your soul,"
16661,Were equal poise of sin and charity.
16662,"That I do beg his life, if it be sin,"
16663,"Heaven let me bear it. You granting of my suit,"
16664,"If that be sin, I’ll make it my morn prayer"
16665,"To have it added to the faults of mine,"
16666,And nothing of your answer.
16667,"Nay, but hear me."
16668,"Your sense pursues not mine. Either you are ignorant,"
16669,"Or seem so, crafty; and that’s not good."
16670,"Let me be ignorant, and in nothing good,"
16671,But graciously to know I am no better.
16672,Thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright
16673,"When it doth tax itself, as these black masks"
16674,Proclaim an enshield beauty ten times louder
16675,"Than beauty could, displayed. But mark me;"
16676,"To be received plain, I’ll speak more gross."
16677,Your brother is to die.
16678,"And his offence is so, as it appears,"
16679,Accountant to the law upon that pain.
16680,Admit no other way to save his life—
16681,"As I subscribe not that, nor any other,"
16682,"But, in the loss of question, that you, his sister,"
16683,Finding yourself desired of such a person
16684,"Whose credit with the judge, or own great place,"
16685,Could fetch your brother from the manacles
16686,Of the all-binding law; and that there were
16687,No earthly mean to save him but that either
16688,You must lay down the treasures of your body
16689,"To this supposed, or else to let him suffer,"
16690,What would you do?
16691,As much for my poor brother as myself.
16692,"That is, were I under the terms of death,"
16693,"Th’ impression of keen whips I’d wear as rubies,"
16694,And strip myself to death as to a bed
16695,"That longing have been sick for, ere I’d yield"
16696,My body up to shame.
16697,Then must your brother die.
16698,And ’twere the cheaper way.
16699,Better it were a brother died at once
16700,"Than that a sister, by redeeming him,"
16701,Should die for ever.
16702,Were not you then as cruel as the sentence
16703,That you have slandered so?
16704,Ignominy in ransom and free pardon
16705,Are of two houses. Lawful mercy
16706,Is nothing kin to foul redemption.
16707,"You seemed of late to make the law a tyrant,"
16708,And rather proved the sliding of your brother
16709,A merriment than a vice.
16710,"O, pardon me, my lord. It oft falls out,"
16711,"To have what we would have, we speak not what we mean."
16712,I something do excuse the thing I hate
16713,For his advantage that I dearly love.
16714,We are all frail.
16715,"Else let my brother die,"
16716,If not a feodary but only he
16717,Owe and succeed by weakness.
16718,"Nay, women are frail too."
16719,"Ay, as the glasses where they view themselves,"
16720,Which are as easy broke as they make forms.
16721,"Women?—Help, heaven! Men their creation mar"
16722,"In profiting by them. Nay, call us ten times frail;"
16723,"For we are soft as our complexions are,"
16724,And credulous to false prints.
16725,I think it well.
16726,"And from this testimony of your own sex,"
16727,Since I suppose we are made to be no stronger
16728,"Than faults may shake our frames, let me be bold."
16729,"I do arrest your words. Be that you are,"
16730,"That is, a woman. If you be more, you’re none."
16731,"If you be one, as you are well expressed"
16732,"By all external warrants, show it now"
16733,By putting on the destined livery.
16734,"I have no tongue but one. Gentle my lord,"
16735,Let me intreat you speak the former language.
16736,"Plainly conceive, I love you."
16737,"My brother did love Juliet,"
16738,And you tell me that he shall die for ’t.
16739,"He shall not, Isabel, if you give me love."
16740,"I know your virtue hath a license in’t,"
16741,"Which seems a little fouler than it is,"
16742,To pluck on others.
16743,"Believe me, on mine honour,"
16744,My words express my purpose.
16745,"Ha! Little honour to be much believed,"
16746,"And most pernicious purpose! Seeming, seeming!"
16747,"I will proclaim thee, Angelo, look for’t."
16748,Sign me a present pardon for my brother
16749,Or with an outstretched throat I’ll tell the world aloud
16750,What man thou art.
16751,"Who will believe thee, Isabel?"
16752,"My unsoiled name, th’ austereness of my life,"
16753,"My vouch against you, and my place i’ th’ state"
16754,Will so your accusation overweigh
16755,"That you shall stifle in your own report,"
16756,"And smell of calumny. I have begun,"
16757,And now I give my sensual race the rein.
16758,Fit thy consent to my sharp appetite;
16759,Lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes
16760,That banish what they sue for. Redeem thy brother
16761,By yielding up thy body to my will;
16762,"Or else he must not only die the death,"
16763,But thy unkindness shall his death draw out
16764,"To ling’ring sufferance. Answer me tomorrow,"
16765,"Or, by the affection that now guides me most,"
16766,"I’ll prove a tyrant to him. As for you,"
16767,"Say what you can, my false o’erweighs your true."
16768,"To whom should I complain? Did I tell this,"
16769,"Who would believe me? O perilous mouths,"
16770,That bear in them one and the self-same tongue
16771,"Either of condemnation or approof,"
16772,"Bidding the law make curtsy to their will,"
16773,"Hooking both right and wrong to th’ appetite,"
16774,To follow as it draws! I’ll to my brother.
16775,"Though he hath fall’n by prompture of the blood,"
16776,Yet hath he in him such a mind of honour
16777,"That, had he twenty heads to tender down"
16778,"On twenty bloody blocks, he’d yield them up"
16779,Before his sister should her body stoop
16780,To such abhorred pollution.
16781,"Then, Isabel, live chaste, and, brother, die."
16782,More than our brother is our chastity.
16783,"I’ll tell him yet of Angelo’s request,"
16784,"And fit his mind to death, for his soul’s rest."
16785,SCENE I. A room in the prison.
16786,"Enter Duke, Claudio and Provost."
16787,So then you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo?
16788,The miserable have no other medicine
16789,"I have hope to live, and am prepared to die."
16790,Be absolute for death. Either death or life
16791,Shall thereby be the sweeter. Reason thus with life:
16792,"If I do lose thee, I do lose a thing"
16793,"That none but fools would keep. A breath thou art,"
16794,Servile to all the skyey influences
16795,That dost this habitation where thou keep’st
16796,"Hourly afflict. Merely, thou art death’s fool;"
16797,"For him thou labour’st by thy flight to shun,"
16798,And yet runn’st toward him still. Thou art not noble;
16799,For all th’ accommodations that thou bear’st
16800,Are nursed by baseness. Thou’rt by no means valiant;
16801,For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork
16802,"Of a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep,"
16803,"And that thou oft provok’st, yet grossly fear’st"
16804,"Thy death, which is no more. Thou art not thyself;"
16805,For thou exists on many a thousand grains
16806,That issue out of dust. Happy thou art not;
16807,"For what thou hast not, still thou striv’st to get,"
16808,"And what thou hast, forget’st. Thou art not certain;"
16809,For thy complexion shifts to strange effects
16810,"After the moon. If thou art rich, thou’rt poor;"
16811,"For, like an ass whose back with ingots bows,"
16812,"Thou bear’st thy heavy riches but a journey,"
16813,And death unloads thee. Friend hast thou none;
16814,"For thine own bowels which do call thee sire,"
16815,"The mere effusion of thy proper loins,"
16816,"Do curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum"
16817,"For ending thee no sooner. Thou hast nor youth nor age,"
16818,But as it were an after-dinner’s sleep
16819,Dreaming on both; for all thy blessed youth
16820,"Becomes as aged, and doth beg the alms"
16821,"Of palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich,"
16822,"Thou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty"
16823,To make thy riches pleasant. What’s yet in this
16824,That bears the name of life? Yet in this life
16825,"Lie hid more thousand deaths; yet death we fear,"
16826,That makes these odds all even.
16827,I humbly thank you.
16828,"To sue to live, I find I seek to die,"
16829,"And seeking death, find life. Let it come on."
16830,Who’s there? Come in. The wish deserves a welcome.
16831,"Dear sir, ere long I’ll visit you again."
16832,"Most holy sir, I thank you."
16833,My business is a word or two with Claudio.
16834,"And very welcome. Look, signior, here’s your sister."
16835,"Provost, a word with you."
16836,As many as you please.
16837,"Bring me to hear them speak, where I may be concealed."
16838,"Now, sister, what’s the comfort?"
16839,"As all comforts are, most good, most good indeed."
16840,"Lord Angelo, having affairs to heaven,"
16841,"Intends you for his swift ambassador,"
16842,Where you shall be an everlasting leiger.
16843,Therefore your best appointment make with speed;
16844,Tomorrow you set on.
16845,Is there no remedy?
16846,"None, but such remedy as, to save a head,"
16847,To cleave a heart in twain.
16848,But is there any?
16849,"Yes, brother, you may live."
16850,"There is a devilish mercy in the judge,"
16851,"If you’ll implore it, that will free your life,"
16852,But fetter you till death.
16853,"Ay, just; perpetual durance; a restraint,"
16854,"Though all the world’s vastidity you had,"
16855,To a determined scope.
16856,But in what nature?
16857,"In such a one as, you consenting to’t,"
16858,"Would bark your honour from that trunk you bear,"
16859,And leave you naked.
16860,Let me know the point.
16861,"O, I do fear thee, Claudio, and I quake,"
16862,"Lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain,"
16863,And six or seven winters more respect
16864,Than a perpetual honour. Dar’st thou die?
16865,The sense of death is most in apprehension;
16866,And the poor beetle that we tread upon
16867,In corporal sufferance finds a pang as great
16868,As when a giant dies.
16869,Why give you me this shame?
16870,Think you I can a resolution fetch
16871,"From flowery tenderness? If I must die,"
16872,I will encounter darkness as a bride
16873,And hug it in mine arms.
16874,There spake my brother! There my father’s grave
16875,"Did utter forth a voice. Yes, thou must die."
16876,Thou art too noble to conserve a life
16877,"In base appliances. This outward-sainted deputy,"
16878,Whose settled visage and deliberate word
16879,"Nips youth i’ th’ head, and follies doth enew"
16880,"As falcon doth the fowl, is yet a devil."
16881,"His filth within being cast, he would appear"
16882,A pond as deep as hell.
16883,"O, ’tis the cunning livery of hell"
16884,The damned’st body to invest and cover
16885,"In precise guards! Dost thou think, Claudio,"
16886,If I would yield him my virginity
16887,Thou mightst be freed?
16888,"O heavens, it cannot be."
16889,"Yes, he would give it thee, from this rank offence,"
16890,So to offend him still. This night’s the time
16891,"That I should do what I abhor to name,"
16892,Or else thou diest tomorrow.
16893,Thou shalt not do’t.
16894,"O, were it but my life,"
16895,I’d throw it down for your deliverance
16896,As frankly as a pin.
16897,"Be ready, Claudio, for your death tomorrow."
16898,Yes. Has he affections in him
16899,That thus can make him bite the law by th’ nose
16900,When he would force it? Sure it is no sin;
16901,Or of the deadly seven it is the least.
16902,Which is the least?
16903,"If it were damnable, he being so wise,"
16904,Why would he for the momentary trick
16905,Be perdurably fined? O Isabel!
16906,What says my brother?
16907,Death is a fearful thing.
16908,And shamed life a hateful.
16909,"Ay, but to die, and go we know not where;"
16910,"To lie in cold obstruction, and to rot;"
16911,This sensible warm motion to become
16912,A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit
16913,"To bathe in fiery floods, or to reside"
16914,In thrilling regions of thick-ribbed ice;
16915,To be imprisoned in the viewless winds
16916,And blown with restless violence round about
16917,The pendent world; or to be worse than worst
16918,Of those that lawless and incertain thought
16919,Imagine howling—’tis too horrible.
16920,The weariest and most loathed worldly life
16921,"That age, ache, penury, and imprisonment"
16922,Can lay on nature is a paradise
16923,To what we fear of death.
16924,"Sweet sister, let me live."
16925,"What sin you do to save a brother’s life,"
16926,Nature dispenses with the deed so far
16927,That it becomes a virtue.
16928,O faithless coward! O dishonest wretch!
16929,Wilt thou be made a man out of my vice?
16930,Is’t not a kind of incest to take life
16931,From thine own sister’s shame? What should I think?
16932,"Heaven shield my mother played my father fair,"
16933,For such a warped slip of wilderness
16934,"Ne’er issued from his blood. Take my defiance,"
16935,"Die, perish! Might but my bending down"
16936,"Reprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed."
16937,"I’ll pray a thousand prayers for thy death,"
16938,No word to save thee.
16939,"Nay, hear me, Isabel."
16940,"O fie, fie, fie!"
16941,"Thy sin’s not accidental, but a trade."
16942,Mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd.
16943,’Tis best that thou diest quickly.
16944,"O, hear me, Isabella."
16945,Enter Duke as a Friar.
16946,"Vouchsafe a word, young sister, but one word."
16947,What is your will?
16948,"Might you dispense with your leisure, I would by and by have some"
16949,speech with you. The satisfaction I would require is likewise your own
16950,"I have no superfluous leisure, my stay must be stolen out of other"
16951,"affairs, but I will attend you a while."
16952,you and your sister. Angelo had never the purpose to corrupt her; only
16953,"he hath made an assay of her virtue, to practise his judgement with the"
16954,"disposition of natures. She, having the truth of honour in her, hath"
16955,made him that gracious denial which he is most glad to receive. I am
16956,"confessor to Angelo, and I know this to be true; therefore prepare"
16957,yourself to death. Do not satisfy your resolution with hopes that are
16958,fallible. Tomorrow you must die; go to your knees and make ready.
16959,Let me ask my sister pardon. I am so out of love with life that I will
16960,sue to be rid of it.
16961,Hold you there. Farewell.
16962,"Provost, a word with you."
16963,"What’s your will, father?"
16964,"That, now you are come, you will be gone. Leave me a while with the"
16965,maid; my mind promises with my habit no loss shall touch her by my
16966,The hand that hath made you fair hath made you good. The goodness that
16967,"is cheap in beauty makes beauty brief in goodness; but grace, being the"
16968,"soul of your complexion, shall keep the body of it ever fair. The"
16969,"assault that Angelo hath made to you, fortune hath conveyed to my"
16970,"understanding; and, but that frailty hath examples for his falling, I"
16971,"should wonder at Angelo. How will you do to content this substitute,"
16972,and to save your brother?
16973,I am now going to resolve him. I had rather my brother die by the law
16974,"than my son should be unlawfully born. But, O, how much is the good"
16975,"Duke deceived in Angelo! If ever he return, and I can speak to him, I"
16976,"will open my lips in vain, or discover his government."
16977,"That shall not be much amiss. Yet, as the matter now stands, he will"
16978,avoid your accusation: he made trial of you only. Therefore fasten your
16979,"ear on my advisings, to the love I have in doing good, a remedy"
16980,presents itself. I do make myself believe that you may most
16981,uprighteously do a poor wronged lady a merited benefit; redeem your
16982,brother from the angry law; do no stain to your own gracious person;
16983,"and much please the absent Duke, if peradventure he shall ever return"
16984,to have hearing of this business.
16985,Let me hear you speak farther. I have spirit to do anything that
16986,appears not foul in the truth of my spirit.
16987,"Virtue is bold, and goodness never fearful. Have you not heard speak of"
16988,"Mariana, the sister of Frederick, the great soldier who miscarried at"
16989,"I have heard of the lady, and good words went with her name."
16990,"She should this Angelo have married, was affianced to her oath, and the"
16991,nuptial appointed. Between which time of the contract and limit of the
16992,"solemnity, her brother Frederick was wrecked at sea, having in that"
16993,perished vessel the dowry of his sister. But mark how heavily this
16994,befell to the poor gentlewoman. There she lost a noble and renowned
16995,"brother, in his love toward her ever most kind and natural; with him,"
16996,"the portion and sinew of her fortune, her marriage dowry; with both,"
16997,"her combinate husband, this well-seeming Angelo."
16998,Can this be so? Did Angelo so leave her?
16999,"Left her in her tears, and dried not one of them with his comfort,"
17000,"swallowed his vows whole, pretending in her discoveries of dishonour;"
17001,"in few, bestowed her on her own lamentation, which she yet wears for"
17002,"his sake; and he, a marble to her tears, is washed with them, but"
17003,What a merit were it in death to take this poor maid from the world!
17004,"What corruption in this life, that it will let this man live! But how"
17005,out of this can she avail?
17006,"It is a rupture that you may easily heal, and the cure of it not only"
17007,"saves your brother, but keeps you from dishonour in doing it."
17008,"Show me how, good father."
17009,This forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance of her first
17010,"affection. His unjust unkindness, that in all reason should have"
17011,"quenched her love, hath, like an impediment in the current, made it"
17012,more violent and unruly. Go you to Angelo; answer his requiring with a
17013,plausible obedience; agree with his demands to the point. Only refer
17014,"yourself to this advantage: first, that your stay with him may not be"
17015,long; that the time may have all shadow and silence in it; and the
17016,"place answer to convenience. This being granted in course, and now"
17017,follows all. We shall advise this wronged maid to stead up your
17018,"appointment, go in your place. If the encounter acknowledge itself"
17019,"hereafter, it may compel him to her recompense; and here, by this, is"
17020,"your brother saved, your honour untainted, the poor Mariana advantaged,"
17021,and the corrupt deputy scaled. The maid will I frame and make fit for
17022,"his attempt. If you think well to carry this as you may, the doubleness"
17023,of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof. What think you of it?
17024,"The image of it gives me content already, and I trust it will grow to a"
17025,It lies much in your holding up. Haste you speedily to Angelo; if for
17026,"this night he entreat you to his bed, give him promise of satisfaction."
17027,I will presently to Saint Luke’s; there at the moated grange resides
17028,this dejected Mariana. At that place call upon me; and dispatch with
17029,"Angelo, that it may be quickly."
17030,"I thank you for this comfort. Fare you well, good father."
17031,SCENE II. The street before the prison.
17032,"Enter Elbow, Pompey and Officers."
17033,"Nay, if there be no remedy for it, but that you will needs buy and sell"
17034,"men and women like beasts, we shall have all the world drink brown and"
17035,"O heavens, what stuff is here?"
17036,"’Twas never merry world since, of two usuries, the merriest was put"
17037,"down, and the worser allowed by order of law a furred gown to keep him"
17038,"warm; and furred with fox on lambskins too, to signify that craft,"
17039,"being richer than innocency, stands for the facing."
17040,"Come your way, sir.—Bless you, good father friar."
17041,"And you, good brother father. What offence hath this man made you, sir?"
17042,"Marry, sir, he hath offended the law; and, sir, we take him to be a"
17043,"thief too, sir; for we have found upon him, sir, a strange picklock,"
17044,which we have sent to the deputy.
17045,"Fie, sirrah, a bawd, a wicked bawd;"
17046,"The evil that thou causest to be done,"
17047,That is thy means to live. Do thou but think
17048,What ’tis to cram a maw or clothe a back
17049,"From such a filthy vice. Say to thyself,"
17050,From their abominable and beastly touches
17051,"I drink, I eat, array myself, and live."
17052,"Canst thou believe thy living is a life,"
17053,"So stinkingly depending? Go mend, go mend."
17054,"Indeed, it does stink in some sort, sir. But yet, sir, I would prove—"
17055,"Nay, if the devil have given thee proofs for sin,"
17056,"Thou wilt prove his. Take him to prison, officer."
17057,Correction and instruction must both work
17058,Ere this rude beast will profit.
17059,"He must before the deputy, sir; he has given him warning. The deputy"
17060,cannot abide a whoremaster. If he be a whoremonger and comes before
17061,"him, he were as good go a mile on his errand."
17062,"That we were all, as some would seem to be,"
17063,"Free from our faults, as faults from seeming, free!"
17064,"His neck will come to your waist—a cord, sir."
17065,"I spy comfort, I cry bail! Here’s a gentleman, and a friend of mine."
17066,"How now, noble Pompey? What, at the wheels of Caesar? Art thou led in"
17067,"triumph? What, is there none of Pygmalion’s images, newly made woman,"
17068,"to be had now, for putting the hand in the pocket and extracting it"
17069,"clutched? What reply, ha? What say’st thou to this tune, matter, and"
17070,"method? Is’t not drowned i’ th’ last rain, ha? What say’st thou, trot?"
17071,"Is the world as it was, man? Which is the way? Is it sad and few words?"
17072,Or how? The trick of it?
17073,"Still thus, and thus; still worse!"
17074,"How doth my dear morsel, thy mistress? Procures she still, ha?"
17075,"Troth, sir, she hath eaten up all her beef, and she is herself in the"
17076,"Why, ’tis good. It is the right of it. It must be so. Ever your fresh"
17077,whore and your powdered bawd; an unshunned consequence; it must be so.
17078,"Art going to prison, Pompey?"
17079,"Why, ’tis not amiss, Pompey. Farewell. Go, say I sent thee thither. For"
17080,"debt, Pompey? Or how?"
17081,"For being a bawd, for being a bawd."
17082,"Well, then, imprison him. If imprisonment be the due of a bawd, why,"
17083,"’tis his right. Bawd is he doubtless, and of antiquity, too. Bawd born."
17084,"Farewell, good Pompey. Commend me to the prison, Pompey. You will turn"
17085,"good husband now, Pompey; you will keep the house."
17086,"I hope, sir, your good worship will be my bail."
17087,"No, indeed, will I not, Pompey; it is not the wear. I will pray,"
17088,"Pompey, to increase your bondage. If you take it not patiently, why,"
17089,"your mettle is the more. Adieu, trusty Pompey.—Bless you, friar."
17090,"Does Bridget paint still, Pompey, ha?"
17091,"Come your ways, sir, come."
17092,"You will not bail me then, sir?"
17093,"Then, Pompey, nor now.—What news abroad, friar? What news?"
17094,"Come your ways, sir, come."
17095,"Go to kennel, Pompey, go."
17096,"What news, friar, of the Duke?"
17097,I know none. Can you tell me of any?
17098,"Some say he is with the Emperor of Russia; other some, he is in Rome."
17099,"But where is he, think you?"
17100,"I know not where, but wheresoever, I wish him well."
17101,It was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from the state and usurp
17102,the beggary he was never born to. Lord Angelo dukes it well in his
17103,absence. He puts transgression to’t.
17104,He does well in’t.
17105,A little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in him. Something too
17106,"crabbed that way, friar."
17107,"It is too general a vice, and severity must cure it."
17108,"Yes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred; it is well allied;"
17109,"but it is impossible to extirp it quite, friar, till eating and"
17110,drinking be put down. They say this Angelo was not made by man and
17111,"woman after this downright way of creation. Is it true, think you?"
17112,"How should he be made, then?"
17113,"Some report a sea-maid spawned him; some, that he was begot between two"
17114,"stockfishes. But it is certain that when he makes water, his urine is"
17115,congealed ice; that I know to be true. And he is a motion ungenerative;
17116,"You are pleasant, sir, and speak apace."
17117,"Why, what a ruthless thing is this in him, for the rebellion of a"
17118,codpiece to take away the life of a man! Would the Duke that is absent
17119,have done this? Ere he would have hanged a man for the getting a
17120,"hundred bastards, he would have paid for the nursing a thousand. He had"
17121,"some feeling of the sport; he knew the service, and that instructed him"
17122,I never heard the absent Duke much detected for women; he was not
17123,"O, sir, you are deceived."
17124,"Who, not the Duke? Yes, your beggar of fifty; and his use was to put a"
17125,ducat in her clack-dish. The Duke had crotchets in him. He would be
17126,"drunk too, that let me inform you."
17127,"You do him wrong, surely."
17128,"Sir, I was an inward of his. A shy fellow was the Duke; and I believe I"
17129,know the cause of his withdrawing.
17130,"What, I prithee, might be the cause?"
17131,"No, pardon. ’Tis a secret must be locked within the teeth and the lips."
17132,But this I can let you understand: the greater file of the subject held
17133,the Duke to be wise.
17134,"Wise? Why, no question but he was."
17135,"A very superficial, ignorant, unweighing fellow."
17136,"Either this is envy in you, folly, or mistaking. The very stream of his"
17137,"life, and the business he hath helmed, must upon a warranted need give"
17138,him a better proclamation. Let him be but testimonied in his own
17139,"bringings-forth, and he shall appear to the envious a scholar, a"
17140,"statesman, and a soldier. Therefore you speak unskilfully. Or, if your"
17141,"knowledge be more, it is much darkened in your malice."
17142,"Sir, I know him, and I love him."
17143,"Love talks with better knowledge, and knowledge with dearer love."
17144,"Come, sir, I know what I know."
17145,"I can hardly believe that, since you know not what you speak. But, if"
17146,"ever the Duke return, as our prayers are he may, let me desire you to"
17147,"make your answer before him. If it be honest you have spoke, you have"
17148,"courage to maintain it. I am bound to call upon you, and I pray you"
17149,"Sir, my name is Lucio, well known to the Duke."
17150,"He shall know you better, sir, if I may live to report you."
17151,I fear you not.
17152,"O, you hope the Duke will return no more; or you imagine me too"
17153,"unhurtful an opposite. But indeed, I can do you little harm. You’ll"
17154,"I’ll be hanged first! Thou art deceived in me, friar. But no more of"
17155,this. Canst thou tell if Claudio die tomorrow or no?
17156,"Why should he die, sir?"
17157,Why? For filling a bottle with a tun-dish. I would the Duke we talk of
17158,were returned again. This ungenitured agent will unpeople the province
17159,with continency. Sparrows must not build in his house-eaves because
17160,they are lecherous. The Duke yet would have dark deeds darkly answered.
17161,"He would never bring them to light. Would he were returned! Marry, this"
17162,"Claudio is condemned for untrussing. Farewell, good friar, I prithee"
17163,"pray for me. The Duke, I say to thee again, would eat mutton on"
17164,"Fridays. He’s now past it; yet, and, I say to thee, he would mouth with"
17165,a beggar though she smelt brown bread and garlic. Say that I said so.
17166,No might nor greatness in mortality
17167,Can censure ’scape. Back-wounding calumny
17168,The whitest virtue strikes. What king so strong
17169,Can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue?
17170,But who comes here?
17171,"Enter Escalus, Provost and Officers with Mistress Overdone, a Bawd."
17172,"Go, away with her to prison."
17173,"Good my lord, be good to me. Your honour is accounted a merciful man,"
17174,"Double and treble admonition, and still forfeit in the same kind? This"
17175,would make mercy swear and play the tyrant.
17176,"A bawd of eleven years’ continuance, may it please your honour."
17177,"My lord, this is one Lucio’s information against me. Mistress Kate"
17178,Keepdown was with child by him in the Duke’s time; he promised her
17179,marriage. His child is a year and a quarter old come Philip and Jacob.
17180,I have kept it myself; and see how he goes about to abuse me.
17181,That fellow is a fellow of much license. Let him be called before us.
17182,"Away with her to prison. Go to, no more words."
17183,"Provost, my brother Angelo will not be altered; Claudio must die"
17184,"tomorrow. Let him be furnished with divines, and have all charitable"
17185,"preparation. If my brother wrought by my pity, it should not be so with"
17186,"So please you, this friar hath been with him, and advised him for th’"
17187,"Good even, good father."
17188,Bliss and goodness on you!
17189,Of whence are you?
17190,"Not of this country, though my chance is now"
17191,To use it for my time. I am a brother
17192,"Of gracious order, late come from the See"
17193,In special business from his Holiness.
17194,What news abroad i’ th’ world?
17195,"None, but that there is so great a fever on goodness that the"
17196,"dissolution of it must cure it. Novelty is only in request, and as it"
17197,is as dangerous to be aged in any kind of course as it is virtuous to
17198,be constant in any undertaking. There is scarce truth enough alive to
17199,make societies secure; but security enough to make fellowships
17200,accursed. Much upon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world. This news
17201,"is old enough, yet it is every day’s news. I pray you, sir, of what"
17202,disposition was the Duke?
17203,"One that, above all other strifes, contended especially to know"
17204,What pleasure was he given to?
17205,"Rather rejoicing to see another merry, than merry at anything which"
17206,professed to make him rejoice. A gentleman of all temperance. But leave
17207,"we him to his events, with a prayer they may prove prosperous, and let"
17208,me desire to know how you find Claudio prepared. I am made to
17209,understand that you have lent him visitation.
17210,"He professes to have received no sinister measure from his judge, but"
17211,most willingly humbles himself to the determination of justice. Yet had
17212,"he framed to himself, by the instruction of his frailty, many deceiving"
17213,"promises of life, which I, by my good leisure, have discredited to him,"
17214,and now he is resolved to die.
17215,"You have paid the heavens your function, and the prisoner the very debt"
17216,of your calling. I have laboured for the poor gentleman to the
17217,"extremest shore of my modesty, but my brother justice have I found so"
17218,severe that he hath forced me to tell him he is indeed Justice.
17219,"If his own life answer the straitness of his proceeding, it shall"
17220,"become him well; wherein if he chance to fail, he hath sentenced"
17221,I am going to visit the prisoner. Fare you well.
17222,Peace be with you.
17223,He who the sword of heaven will bear
17224,"Should be as holy as severe,"
17225,"Pattern in himself to know,"
17226,"Grace to stand, and virtue go;"
17227,More nor less to others paying
17228,Than by self-offences weighing.
17229,Shame to him whose cruel striking
17230,Kills for faults of his own liking!
17231,"Twice treble shame on Angelo,"
17232,"To weed my vice, and let his grow!"
17233,"O, what may man within him hide,"
17234,Though angel on the outward side!
17235,"How may likeness, made in crimes,"
17236,"Make practice on the times,"
17237,To draw with idle spiders’ strings
17238,Most ponderous and substantial things!
17239,Craft against vice I must apply.
17240,With Angelo tonight shall lie
17241,His old betrothed but despised.
17242,"So disguise shall, by th’ disguised,"
17243,"Pay with falsehood false exacting,"
17244,And perform an old contracting.
17245,SCENE I. A room in Mariana’s house.
17246,Enter Mariana and a Boy singing.
17247,"_  Take, O take those lips away,"
17248,"That so sweetly were forsworn,"
17249,"And those eyes, the break of day,"
17250,Lights that do mislead the morn.
17251,"But my kisses bring again,"
17252,"Seals of love, but sealed in vain,"
17253,Enter Duke as a Friar.
17254,"Break off thy song, and haste thee quick away;"
17255,"Here comes a man of comfort, whose advice"
17256,Hath often stilled my brawling discontent.
17257,"I cry you mercy, sir, and well could wish"
17258,You had not found me here so musical.
17259,"Let me excuse me, and believe me so,"
17260,"My mirth it much displeased, but pleased my woe."
17261,’Tis good; though music oft hath such a charm
17262,To make bad good and good provoke to harm.
17263,"I pray you tell me, hath anybody inquired for me here today? Much upon"
17264,this time have I promised here to meet.
17265,You have not been inquired after. I have sat here all day.
17266,I do constantly believe you. The time is come even now. I shall crave
17267,your forbearance a little. Maybe I will call upon you anon for some
17268,I am always bound to you.
17269,"Very well met, and welcome."
17270,What is the news from this good deputy?
17271,"He hath a garden circummured with brick,"
17272,Whose western side is with a vineyard backed;
17273,And to that vineyard is a planched gate
17274,That makes his opening with this bigger key.
17275,This other doth command a little door
17276,Which from the vineyard to the garden leads;
17277,"There have I made my promise, upon the"
17278,Heavy middle of the night to call on him.
17279,But shall you on your knowledge find this way?
17280,I have ta’en a due and wary note upon’t;
17281,"With whispering and most guilty diligence,"
17282,"In action all of precept, he did show me"
17283,The way twice o’er.
17284,Are there no other tokens
17285,Between you ’greed concerning her observance?
17286,"No, none, but only a repair i’ th’ dark,"
17287,And that I have possessed him my most stay
17288,"Can be but brief, for I have made him know"
17289,"I have a servant comes with me along,"
17290,That stays upon me; whose persuasion is
17291,I come about my brother.
17292,’Tis well borne up.
17293,I have not yet made known to Mariana
17294,"A word of this.—What ho, within! Come forth."
17295,I pray you be acquainted with this maid;
17296,She comes to do you good.
17297,I do desire the like.
17298,Do you persuade yourself that I respect you?
17299,"Good friar, I know you do, and have found it."
17300,"Take, then, this your companion by the hand,"
17301,Who hath a story ready for your ear.
17302,I shall attend your leisure; but make haste.
17303,The vaporous night approaches.
17304,Will’t please you walk aside?
17305,"O place and greatness, millions of false eyes"
17306,Are stuck upon thee; volumes of report
17307,"Run with these false, and most contrarious quest"
17308,Upon thy doings; thousand escapes of wit
17309,Make thee the father of their idle dream
17310,And rack thee in their fancies.
17311,Enter Mariana and Isabella.
17312,"She’ll take the enterprise upon her, father,"
17313,If you advise it.
17314,"It is not my consent,"
17315,But my entreaty too.
17316,Little have you to say
17317,"When you depart from him, but, soft and low,"
17318,“Remember now my brother.”
17319,"Nor, gentle daughter, fear you not at all."
17320,He is your husband on a pre-contract.
17321,"To bring you thus together ’tis no sin,"
17322,Sith that the justice of your title to him
17323,"Doth flourish the deceit. Come, let us go;"
17324,"Our corn’s to reap, for yet our tithe’s to sow."
17325,SCENE II. A room in the prison.
17326,Enter Provost and Pompey.
17327,"Come hither, sirrah. Can you cut off a man’s head?"
17328,"If the man be a bachelor, sir, I can; but if he be a married man, he’s"
17329,"his wife’s head, and I can never cut off a woman’s head."
17330,"Come, sir, leave me your snatches, and yield me a direct answer."
17331,Tomorrow morning are to die Claudio and Barnardine. Here is in our
17332,"prison a common executioner, who in his office lacks a helper; if you"
17333,"will take it on you to assist him, it shall redeem you from your gyves;"
17334,"if not, you shall have your full time of imprisonment, and your"
17335,deliverance with an unpitied whipping; for you have been a notorious
17336,"Sir, I have been an unlawful bawd time out of mind, but yet I will be"
17337,content to be a lawful hangman. I would be glad to receive some
17338,instruction from my fellow-partner.
17339,"What ho, Abhorson! Where’s Abhorson, there?"
17340,"Do you call, sir?"
17341,"Sirrah, here’s a fellow will help you tomorrow in your execution. If"
17342,"you think it meet, compound with him by the year, and let him abide"
17343,"here with you; if not, use him for the present, and dismiss him. He"
17344,cannot plead his estimation with you; he hath been a bawd.
17345,"A bawd, sir? Fie upon him, he will discredit our mystery."
17346,"Go to, sir; you weigh equally. A feather will turn the scale."
17347,"Pray, sir, by your good favour—for surely, sir, a good favour you have,"
17348,"but that you have a hanging look—do you call, sir, your occupation a"
17349,"Ay, sir, a mystery."
17350,"Painting, sir, I have heard say, is a mystery; and your whores, sir,"
17351,"being members of my occupation, using painting, do prove my occupation"
17352,"a mystery. But what mystery there should be in hanging, if I should be"
17353,"hanged, I cannot imagine."
17354,"Sir, it is a mystery."
17355,Every true man’s apparel fits your thief. If it be too little for your
17356,"thief, your true man thinks it big enough; if it be too big for your"
17357,"thief, your thief thinks it little enough. So every true man’s apparel"
17358,"Sir, I will serve him; for I do find your hangman is a more penitent"
17359,trade than your bawd. He doth oftener ask forgiveness.
17360,"You, sirrah, provide your block and your axe tomorrow four o’clock."
17361,"Come on, bawd. I will instruct thee in my trade. Follow."
17362,"I do desire to learn, sir; and I hope, if you have occasion to use me"
17363,"for your own turn, you shall find me yare. For truly, sir, for your"
17364,kindness I owe you a good turn.
17365,Call hither Barnardine and Claudio.
17366,"Th’ one has my pity; not a jot the other,"
17367,"Being a murderer, though he were my brother."
17368,"Look, here’s the warrant, Claudio, for thy death."
17369,"’Tis now dead midnight, and by eight tomorrow"
17370,Thou must be made immortal. Where’s Barnardine?
17371,As fast locked up in sleep as guiltless labour
17372,When it lies starkly in the traveller’s bones.
17373,He will not wake.
17374,Who can do good on him?
17375,"Well, go, prepare yourself. [_Knocking within_.] But hark, what noise?"
17376,Heaven give your spirits comfort!
17377,I hope it is some pardon or reprieve
17378,For the most gentle Claudio.
17379,The best and wholesom’st spirits of the night
17380,"Envelop you, good Provost! Who called here of late?"
17381,"None, since the curfew rung."
17382,"They will then, ere’t be long."
17383,What comfort is for Claudio?
17384,There’s some in hope.
17385,It is a bitter deputy.
17386,"Not so, not so. His life is paralleled"
17387,Even with the stroke and line of his great justice.
17388,He doth with holy abstinence subdue
17389,That in himself which he spurs on his power
17390,To qualify in others. Were he mealed with that
17391,"Which he corrects, then were he tyrannous;"
17392,"But this being so, he’s just."
17393,Now are they come.
17394,This is a gentle provost. Seldom when
17395,The steeled gaoler is the friend of men.
17396,How now? What noise? That spirit’s possessed with haste
17397,That wounds th’ unsisting postern with these strokes.
17398,There he must stay until the officer
17399,Arise to let him in. He is called up.
17400,"Have you no countermand for Claudio yet,"
17401,But he must die tomorrow?
17402,"As near the dawning, Provost, as it is,"
17403,You shall hear more ere morning.
17404,"You something know, yet I believe there comes"
17405,No countermand. No such example have we.
17406,"Besides, upon the very siege of justice"
17407,Lord Angelo hath to the public ear
17408,This is his Lordship’s man.
17409,And here comes Claudio’s pardon.
17410,"My lord hath sent you this note, and by me this further charge: that"
17411,"you swerve not from the smallest article of it, neither in time,"
17412,"matter, or other circumstance. Good morrow; for, as I take it, it is"
17413,I shall obey him.
17414,For which the pardoner himself is in.
17415,"Hence hath offence his quick celerity,"
17416,When it is borne in high authority.
17417,"When vice makes mercy, mercy’s so extended"
17418,That for the fault’s love is th’ offender friended.
17419,"Now, sir, what news?"
17420,"I told you: Lord Angelo, belike thinking me remiss in mine office,"
17421,"awakens me with this unwonted putting-on; methinks strangely, for he"
17422,hath not used it before.
17423,"Pray you, let’s hear."
17424,"executed by four of the clock, and in the afternoon, Barnardine. For my"
17425,"better satisfaction, let me have Claudio’s head sent me by five. Let"
17426,"this be duly performed, with a thought that more depends on it than we"
17427,"must yet deliver. Thus fail not to do your office, as you will answer"
17428,it at your peril._
17429,"What say you to this, sir?"
17430,What is that Barnardine who is to be executed in th’ afternoon?
17431,"A Bohemian born, but here nursed up and bred; one that is a prisoner"
17432,How came it that the absent Duke had not either delivered him to his
17433,"liberty, or executed him? I have heard it was ever his manner to do so."
17434,"His friends still wrought reprieves for him; and indeed, his fact till"
17435,"now in the government of Lord Angelo, came not to an undoubtful proof."
17436,It is now apparent?
17437,"Most manifest, and not denied by himself."
17438,Hath he borne himself penitently in prison? How seems he to be touched?
17439,A man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but as a drunken sleep;
17440,"careless, reckless, and fearless of what’s past, present, or to come;"
17441,insensible of mortality and desperately mortal.
17442,He will hear none. He hath evermore had the liberty of the prison; give
17443,"him leave to escape hence, he would not. Drunk many times a day, if not"
17444,"many days entirely drunk. We have very oft awaked him, as if to carry"
17445,"him to execution, and showed him a seeming warrant for it. It hath not"
17446,moved him at all.
17447,"More of him anon. There is written in your brow, Provost, honesty and"
17448,"constancy; if I read it not truly, my ancient skill beguiles me. But in"
17449,"the boldness of my cunning I will lay myself in hazard. Claudio, whom"
17450,"here you have warrant to execute, is no greater forfeit to the law than"
17451,Angelo who hath sentenced him. To make you understand this in a
17452,"manifested effect, I crave but four days’ respite, for the which you"
17453,are to do me both a present and a dangerous courtesy.
17454,"Pray, sir, in what?"
17455,In the delaying death.
17456,"Alack, how may I do it? Having the hour limited, and an express"
17457,"command, under penalty, to deliver his head in the view of Angelo? I"
17458,"may make my case as Claudio’s, to cross this in the smallest."
17459,"By the vow of mine order, I warrant you, if my instructions may be your"
17460,"guide. Let this Barnardine be this morning executed, and his head borne"
17461,"Angelo hath seen them both, and will discover the favour."
17462,"O, death’s a great disguiser, and you may add to it. Shave the head and"
17463,"tie the beard, and say it was the desire of the penitent to be so bared"
17464,before his death. You know the course is common. If anything fall to
17465,"you upon this, more than thanks and good fortune, by the saint whom I"
17466,"profess, I will plead against it with my life."
17467,"Pardon me, good father; it is against my oath."
17468,"Were you sworn to the Duke, or to the Deputy?"
17469,To him and to his substitutes.
17470,You will think you have made no offence if the Duke avouch the justice
17471,But what likelihood is in that?
17472,"Not a resemblance, but a certainty. Yet since I see you fearful, that"
17473,"neither my coat, integrity, nor persuasion, can with ease attempt you,"
17474,"I will go further than I meant, to pluck all fears out of you. Look"
17475,"you, sir, here is the hand and seal of the Duke. You know the"
17476,"character, I doubt not, and the signet is not strange to you."
17477,I know them both.
17478,The contents of this is the return of the Duke; you shall anon
17479,"over-read it at your pleasure, where you shall find within these two"
17480,days he will be here. This is a thing that Angelo knows not; for he
17481,"this very day receives letters of strange tenour, perchance of the"
17482,"Duke’s death, perchance entering into some monastery; but, by chance,"
17483,"nothing of what is writ. Look, th’ unfolding star calls up the"
17484,shepherd. Put not yourself into amazement how these things should be.
17485,All difficulties are but easy when they are known. Call your
17486,"executioner, and off with Barnardine’s head. I will give him a present"
17487,"shrift, and advise him for a better place. Yet you are amazed; but this"
17488,shall absolutely resolve you. Come away; it is almost clear dawn.
17489,SCENE III. Another room in the same.
17490,I am as well acquainted here as I was in our house of profession. One
17491,"would think it were Mistress Overdone’s own house, for here be many of"
17492,"her old customers. First, here’s young Master Rash; he’s in for a"
17493,"commodity of brown paper and old ginger, nine score and seventeen"
17494,"pounds; of which he made five marks ready money. Marry, then ginger was"
17495,"not much in request, for the old women were all dead. Then is there"
17496,"here one Master Caper, at the suit of Master Three-pile the mercer, for"
17497,"some four suits of peach-coloured satin, which now peaches him a"
17498,"beggar. Then have we here young Dizie, and young Master Deep-vow, and"
17499,"Master Copperspur, and Master Starve-lackey, the rapier and dagger man,"
17500,"and young Drop-heir that killed lusty Pudding, and Master Forthright"
17501,"the tilter, and brave Master Shoe-tie the great traveller, and wild"
17502,"Half-can that stabbed Pots, and I think forty more, all great doers in"
17503,"our trade, and are now “for the Lord’s sake.”"
17504,"Sirrah, bring Barnardine hither."
17505,"Master Barnardine! You must rise and be hanged, Master Barnardine."
17506,"Your friends, sir; the hangman. You must be so good, sir, to rise and"
17507,be put to death.
17508,"Tell him he must awake, and that quickly too."
17509,"Pray, Master Barnardine, awake till you are executed, and sleep"
17510,"Go in to him, and fetch him out."
17511,"He is coming, sir, he is coming. I hear his straw rustle."
17512,"Is the axe upon the block, sirrah?"
17513,"How now, Abhorson? What’s the news with you?"
17514,"Truly, sir, I would desire you to clap into your prayers; for, look"
17515,"you, the warrant’s come."
17516,"You rogue, I have been drinking all night; I am not fitted for’t."
17517,"O, the better, sir; for he that drinks all night and is hanged betimes"
17518,in the morning may sleep the sounder all the next day.
17519,"Look you, sir, here comes your ghostly father. Do we jest now, think"
17520,"Sir, induced by my charity, and hearing how hastily you are to depart,"
17521,"I am come to advise you, comfort you, and pray with you."
17522,"Friar, not I. I have been drinking hard all night, and I will have more"
17523,"time to prepare me, or they shall beat out my brains with billets. I"
17524,"will not consent to die this day, that’s certain."
17525,"O, sir, you must; and therefore I beseech you"
17526,Look forward on the journey you shall go.
17527,I swear I will not die today for any man’s persuasion.
17528,"Not a word. If you have anything to say to me, come to my ward, for"
17529,thence will not I today.
17530,Unfit to live or die. O gravel heart!
17531,"After him, fellows; bring him to the block."
17532,"Now, sir, how do you find the prisoner?"
17533,"A creature unprepared, unmeet for death;"
17534,And to transport him in the mind he is
17535,"Here in the prison, father,"
17536,There died this morning of a cruel fever
17537,"One Ragozine, a most notorious pirate,"
17538,A man of Claudio’s years; his beard and head
17539,Just of his colour. What if we do omit
17540,"This reprobate till he were well inclined,"
17541,And satisfy the Deputy with the visage
17542,"Of Ragozine, more like to Claudio?"
17543,"O, ’tis an accident that heaven provides!"
17544,Dispatch it presently; the hour draws on
17545,"Prefixed by Angelo. See this be done,"
17546,"And sent according to command, whiles I"
17547,Persuade this rude wretch willingly to die.
17548,"This shall be done, good father, presently."
17549,But Barnardine must die this afternoon;
17550,"And how shall we continue Claudio,"
17551,To save me from the danger that might come
17552,If he were known alive?
17553,Let this be done:
17554,"Put them in secret holds, both Barnardine and Claudio."
17555,Ere twice the sun hath made his journal greeting
17556,"To yonder generation, you shall find"
17557,I am your free dependant.
17558,"Quick, dispatch, and send the head to Angelo."
17559,"Now will I write letters to Angelo,"
17560,"The Provost, he shall bear them, whose contents"
17561,Shall witness to him I am near at home;
17562,And that by great injunctions I am bound
17563,To enter publicly. Him I’ll desire
17564,"To meet me at the consecrated fount,"
17565,"A league below the city; and from thence,"
17566,By cold gradation and well-balanced form.
17567,We shall proceed with Angelo.
17568,Here is the head; I’ll carry it myself.
17569,Convenient is it. Make a swift return;
17570,For I would commune with you of such things
17571,That want no ear but yours.
17572,I’ll make all speed.
17573,The tongue of Isabel. She’s come to know
17574,If yet her brother’s pardon be come hither.
17575,"But I will keep her ignorant of her good,"
17576,To make her heavenly comforts of despair
17577,When it is least expected.
17578,"Ho, by your leave!"
17579,"Good morning to you, fair and gracious daughter."
17580,"The better, given me by so holy a man."
17581,Hath yet the Deputy sent my brother’s pardon?
17582,"He hath released him, Isabel, from the world."
17583,"His head is off, and sent to Angelo."
17584,"Nay, but it is not so."
17585,It is no other.
17586,"Show your wisdom, daughter, in your close patience."
17587,"O, I will to him and pluck out his eyes!"
17588,You shall not be admitted to his sight.
17589,Unhappy Claudio! Wretched Isabel!
17590,Injurious world! Most damned Angelo!
17591,This nor hurts him nor profits you a jot.
17592,"Forbear it, therefore; give your cause to heaven."
17593,"Mark what I say, which you shall find"
17594,By every syllable a faithful verity.
17595,"The Duke comes home tomorrow;—nay, dry your eyes."
17596,"One of our convent, and his confessor,"
17597,Gives me this instance. Already he hath carried
17598,"Notice to Escalus and Angelo,"
17599,"Who do prepare to meet him at the gates,"
17600,"There to give up their power. If you can, pace your wisdom"
17601,"In that good path that I would wish it go,"
17602,"And you shall have your bosom on this wretch,"
17603,"Grace of the Duke, revenges to your heart,"
17604,I am directed by you.
17605,"This letter, then, to Friar Peter give;"
17606,’Tis that he sent me of the Duke’s return.
17607,"Say, by this token, I desire his company"
17608,At Mariana’s house tonight. Her cause and yours
17609,"I’ll perfect him withal, and he shall bring you"
17610,Before the Duke; and to the head of Angelo
17611,"Accuse him home and home. For my poor self,"
17612,"I am combined by a sacred vow,"
17613,And shall be absent. Wend you with this letter.
17614,Command these fretting waters from your eyes
17615,"With a light heart; trust not my holy order,"
17616,If I pervert your course.—Who’s here?
17617,"Good even. Friar, where is the Provost?"
17618,"O pretty Isabella, I am pale at mine heart to see thine eyes so red."
17619,Thou must be patient. I am fain to dine and sup with water and bran. I
17620,dare not for my head fill my belly. One fruitful meal would set me
17621,"to’t. But they say the Duke will be here tomorrow. By my troth, Isabel,"
17622,I loved thy brother. If the old fantastical duke of dark corners had
17623,"been at home, he had lived."
17624,"Sir, the Duke is marvellous little beholding to your reports; but the"
17625,"best is, he lives not in them."
17626,"Friar, thou knowest not the Duke so well as I do. He’s a better woodman"
17627,than thou tak’st him for.
17628,"Well, you’ll answer this one day. Fare ye well."
17629,"Nay, tarry, I’ll go along with thee. I can tell thee pretty tales of"
17630,"You have told me too many of him already, sir, if they be true; if not"
17631,"true, none were enough."
17632,I was once before him for getting a wench with child.
17633,Did you such a thing?
17634,"Yes, marry, did I; but I was fain to forswear it. They would else have"
17635,married me to the rotten medlar.
17636,"Sir, your company is fairer than honest. Rest you well."
17637,"By my troth, I’ll go with thee to the lane’s end. If bawdy talk offend"
17638,"you, we’ll have very little of it. Nay, friar, I am a kind of burr; I"
17639,SCENE IV. A room in Angelo’s house.
17640,Enter Angelo and Escalus.
17641,Every letter he hath writ hath disvouched other.
17642,In most uneven and distracted manner. His actions show much like to
17643,madness; pray heaven his wisdom be not tainted. And why meet him at the
17644,gates and redeliver our authorities there?
17645,"And why should we proclaim it in an hour before his entering, that if"
17646,"any crave redress of injustice, they should exhibit their petitions in"
17647,"He shows his reason for that: to have a dispatch of complaints, and to"
17648,"deliver us from devices hereafter, which shall then have no power to"
17649,"Well, I beseech you, let it be proclaimed."
17650,Betimes i’ th’ morn I’ll call you at your house.
17651,Give notice to such men of sort and suit
17652,As are to meet him.
17653,"I shall, sir. Fare you well."
17654,"This deed unshapes me quite, makes me unpregnant"
17655,And dull to all proceedings. A deflowered maid;
17656,And by an eminent body that enforced
17657,The law against it! But that her tender shame
17658,"Will not proclaim against her maiden loss,"
17659,"How might she tongue me! Yet reason dares her no,"
17660,For my authority bears so credent bulk
17661,That no particular scandal once can touch
17662,"But it confounds the breather. He should have lived,"
17663,"Save that his riotous youth, with dangerous sense,"
17664,Might in the times to come have ta’en revenge
17665,By so receiving a dishonoured life
17666,With ransom of such shame. Would yet he had lived.
17667,"Alack, when once our grace we have forgot,"
17668,"Nothing goes right; we would, and we would not."
17669,SCENE V. Fields without the town.
17670,"Enter Duke, in his own habit, and Friar Peter."
17671,These letters at fit time deliver me.
17672,The Provost knows our purpose and our plot.
17673,"The matter being afoot, keep your instruction"
17674,"And hold you ever to our special drift,"
17675,Though sometimes you do blench from this to that
17676,"As cause doth minister. Go call at Flavius’ house,"
17677,And tell him where I stay. Give the like notice
17678,"To Valencius, Rowland, and to Crassus,"
17679,And bid them bring the trumpets to the gate.
17680,But send me Flavius first.
17681,It shall be speeded well.
17682,"I thank thee, Varrius, thou hast made good haste."
17683,"Come, we will walk. There’s other of our friends"
17684,Will greet us here anon. My gentle Varrius.
17685,SCENE VI. Street near the city gate.
17686,Enter Isabella and Mariana.
17687,To speak so indirectly I am loath;
17688,"I would say the truth, but to accuse him so"
17689,"That is your part; yet I am advised to do it,"
17690,"He says, to veil full purpose."
17691,Be ruled by him.
17692,"Besides, he tells me that, if peradventure"
17693,"He speak against me on the adverse side,"
17694,"I should not think it strange, for ’tis a physic"
17695,That’s bitter to sweet end.
17696,I would Friar Peter—
17697,"O, peace, the friar is come."
17698,"Come, I have found you out a stand most fit,"
17699,Where you may have such vantage on the Duke
17700,He shall not pass you. Twice have the trumpets sounded.
17701,The generous and gravest citizens
17702,"Have hent the gates, and very near upon"
17703,"The Duke is entering. Therefore hence, away."
17704,SCENE I. A public place near the city gate.
17705,"Enter at several doors Duke, Varrius, Lords; Angelo, Escalus, Lucio,"
17706,"Provost, Officers and Citizens."
17707,"My very worthy cousin, fairly met."
17708,"Our old and faithful friend, we are glad to see you."
17709,Happy return be to your royal grace!
17710,Many and hearty thankings to you both.
17711,"We have made inquiry of you, and we hear"
17712,Such goodness of your justice that our soul
17713,"Cannot but yield you forth to public thanks,"
17714,You make my bonds still greater.
17715,"O, your desert speaks loud, and I should wrong it"
17716,"To lock it in the wards of covert bosom,"
17717,When it deserves with characters of brass
17718,A forted residence ’gainst the tooth of time
17719,And rasure of oblivion. Give me your hand
17720,"And let the subject see, to make them know"
17721,That outward courtesies would fain proclaim
17722,"Favours that keep within.—Come, Escalus,"
17723,You must walk by us on our other hand.
17724,And good supporters are you.
17725,Enter Friar Peter and Isabella.
17726,"Now is your time. Speak loud, and kneel before him."
17727,"Justice, O royal Duke! Vail your regard"
17728,"Upon a wronged—I would fain have said, a maid."
17729,"O worthy prince, dishonour not your eye"
17730,By throwing it on any other object
17731,"Till you have heard me in my true complaint,"
17732,"And given me justice, justice, justice, justice!"
17733,Relate your wrongs. In what? By whom? Be brief.
17734,Here is Lord Angelo shall give you justice.
17735,Reveal yourself to him.
17736,You bid me seek redemption of the devil.
17737,"Hear me yourself, for that which I must speak"
17738,"Must either punish me, not being believed,"
17739,"Or wring redress from you. Hear me, O hear me, here!"
17740,"My lord, her wits, I fear me, are not firm."
17741,"She hath been a suitor to me for her brother,"
17742,Cut off by course of justice.
17743,By course of justice!
17744,And she will speak most bitterly and strange.
17745,"Most strange, but yet most truly will I speak."
17746,"That Angelo’s forsworn, is it not strange?"
17747,"That Angelo’s a murderer, is’t not strange?"
17748,"That Angelo is an adulterous thief,"
17749,"An hypocrite, a virgin-violator,"
17750,Is it not strange and strange?
17751,"Nay, it is ten times strange."
17752,It is not truer he is Angelo
17753,Than this is all as true as it is strange.
17754,"Nay, it is ten times true, for truth is truth"
17755,To th’ end of reckoning.
17756,"Away with her. Poor soul,"
17757,She speaks this in th’ infirmity of sense.
17758,"O Prince, I conjure thee, as thou believ’st"
17759,"There is another comfort than this world,"
17760,That thou neglect me not with that opinion
17761,That I am touched with madness. Make not impossible
17762,That which but seems unlike. ’Tis not impossible
17763,"But one, the wicked’st caitiff on the ground,"
17764,"May seem as shy, as grave, as just, as absolute,"
17765,"As Angelo; even so may Angelo,"
17766,"In all his dressings, characts, titles, forms,"
17767,"Be an arch-villain. Believe it, royal Prince,"
17768,"If he be less, he’s nothing; but he’s more,"
17769,Had I more name for badness.
17770,"If she be mad, as I believe no other,"
17771,"Her madness hath the oddest frame of sense,"
17772,"Such a dependency of thing on thing,"
17773,As e’er I heard in madness.
17774,Harp not on that; nor do not banish reason
17775,For inequality; but let your reason serve
17776,"To make the truth appear where it seems hid,"
17777,And hide the false seems true.
17778,Many that are not mad
17779,"Have, sure, more lack of reason. What would you say?"
17780,"I am the sister of one Claudio,"
17781,Condemned upon the act of fornication
17782,To lose his head; condemned by Angelo.
17783,"I, in probation of a sisterhood,"
17784,Was sent to by my brother; one Lucio
17785,As then the messenger.
17786,"That’s I, an’t like your Grace."
17787,I came to her from Claudio and desired her
17788,To try her gracious fortune with Lord Angelo
17789,For her poor brother’s pardon.
17790,You were not bid to speak.
17791,"No, my good lord,"
17792,Nor wished to hold my peace.
17793,"I wish you now, then;"
17794,Pray you take note of it; and when you have
17795,"A business for yourself, pray heaven you then"
17796,I warrant your honour.
17797,The warrant’s for yourself. Take heed to it.
17798,This gentleman told somewhat of my tale.
17799,"It may be right, but you are i’ the wrong"
17800,To speak before your time.—Proceed.
17801,To this pernicious caitiff deputy.
17802,That’s somewhat madly spoken.
17803,The phrase is to the matter.
17804,Mended again. The matter; proceed.
17805,"In brief, to set the needless process by:"
17806,"How I persuaded, how I prayed and kneeled,"
17807,"How he refelled me, and how I replied—"
17808,For this was of much length—the vile conclusion
17809,I now begin with grief and shame to utter.
17810,"He would not, but by gift of my chaste body"
17811,"To his concupiscible intemperate lust,"
17812,"Release my brother; and after much debatement,"
17813,"My sisterly remorse confutes mine honour,"
17814,"And I did yield to him. But the next morn betimes,"
17815,"His purpose surfeiting, he sends a warrant"
17816,For my poor brother’s head.
17817,This is most likely!
17818,"O, that it were as like as it is true!"
17819,"By heaven, fond wretch, thou know’st not what thou speak’st,"
17820,Or else thou art suborned against his honour
17821,"In hateful practice. First, his integrity"
17822,"Stands without blemish; next, it imports no reason"
17823,That with such vehemency he should pursue
17824,"Faults proper to himself. If he had so offended,"
17825,"He would have weighed thy brother by himself,"
17826,And not have cut him off. Someone hath set you on.
17827,"Confess the truth, and say by whose advice"
17828,Thou cam’st here to complain.
17829,And is this all?
17830,"Then, O you blessed ministers above,"
17831,"Keep me in patience, and with ripened time"
17832,Unfold the evil which is here wrapt up
17833,"In countenance! Heaven shield your Grace from woe,"
17834,"As I, thus wronged, hence unbelieved go."
17835,I know you’d fain be gone. An officer!
17836,To prison with her! Shall we thus permit
17837,A blasting and a scandalous breath to fall
17838,On him so near us? This needs must be a practice.
17839,Who knew of your intent and coming hither?
17840,"One that I would were here, Friar Lodowick."
17841,"A ghostly father, belike. Who knows that Lodowick?"
17842,"My lord, I know him. ’Tis a meddling friar."
17843,"I do not like the man. Had he been lay, my lord,"
17844,For certain words he spake against your Grace
17845,"In your retirement, I had swinged him soundly."
17846,"Words against me? This’s a good friar, belike."
17847,And to set on this wretched woman here
17848,Against our substitute! Let this friar be found.
17849,"But yesternight, my lord, she and that friar,"
17850,"I saw them at the prison. A saucy friar,"
17851,A very scurvy fellow.
17852,Blessed be your royal Grace!
17853,"I have stood by, my lord, and I have heard"
17854,Your royal ear abused. First hath this woman
17855,"Most wrongfully accused your substitute,"
17856,Who is as free from touch or soil with her
17857,As she from one ungot.
17858,We did believe no less.
17859,Know you that Friar Lodowick that she speaks of?
17860,"I know him for a man divine and holy,"
17861,"Not scurvy, nor a temporary meddler,"
17862,As he’s reported by this gentleman;
17863,"And, on my trust, a man that never yet"
17864,"Did, as he vouches, misreport your Grace."
17865,"My lord, most villainously; believe it."
17866,"Well, he in time may come to clear himself;"
17867,"But at this instant he is sick, my lord,"
17868,"Of a strange fever. Upon his mere request,"
17869,Being come to knowledge that there was complaint
17870,"Intended ’gainst Lord Angelo, came I hither"
17871,"To speak, as from his mouth, what he doth know"
17872,Is true and false; and what he with his oath
17873,And all probation will make up full clear
17874,"Whensoever he’s convented. First, for this woman,"
17875,"To justify this worthy nobleman,"
17876,"So vulgarly and personally accused,"
17877,"Her shall you hear disproved to her eyes,"
17878,Till she herself confess it.
17879,"Good friar, let’s hear it."
17880,"Do you not smile at this, Lord Angelo?"
17881,"O heaven, the vanity of wretched fools!"
17882,"Give us some seats.—Come, cousin Angelo,"
17883,In this I’ll be impartial. Be you judge
17884,Of your own cause.
17885,"Is this the witness, friar?"
17886,"First let her show her face, and after speak."
17887,"Pardon, my lord; I will not show my face"
17888,Until my husband bid me.
17889,"What, are you married?"
17890,Are you a maid?
17891,"Why, you are nothing then, neither maid, widow, nor wife?"
17892,"My lord, she may be a punk; for many of them are neither maid, widow,"
17893,Silence that fellow. I would he had some cause to prattle for himself.
17894,"My lord, I do confess I ne’er was married,"
17895,"And I confess besides, I am no maid."
17896,I have known my husband; yet my husband
17897,Knows not that ever he knew me.
17898,"He was drunk, then, my lord; it can be no better."
17899,"For the benefit of silence, would thou wert so too."
17900,This is no witness for Lord Angelo.
17901,"Now I come to’t, my lord."
17902,She that accuses him of fornication
17903,"In self-same manner doth accuse my husband,"
17904,"And charges him, my lord, with such a time"
17905,When I’ll depose I had him in mine arms
17906,With all th’ effect of love.
17907,Charges she more than me?
17908,Not that I know.
17909,No? You say your husband.
17910,"Why, just, my lord, and that is Angelo,"
17911,"Who thinks he knows that he ne’er knew my body,"
17912,"But knows, he thinks, that he knows Isabel’s."
17913,This is a strange abuse. Let’s see thy face.
17914,My husband bids me; now I will unmask. [_Unveiling_.]
17915,"This is that face, thou cruel Angelo,"
17916,Which once thou swor’st was worth the looking on.
17917,"This is the hand which, with a vowed contract,"
17918,Was fast belocked in thine. This is the body
17919,That took away the match from Isabel
17920,And did supply thee at thy garden-house
17921,In her imagined person.
17922,Know you this woman?
17923,"My lord, I must confess I know this woman;"
17924,And five years since there was some speech of marriage
17925,"Betwixt myself and her; which was broke off,"
17926,Partly for that her promised proportions
17927,Came short of composition; but in chief
17928,For that her reputation was disvalued
17929,In levity. Since which time of five years
17930,"I never spake with her, saw her, nor heard from her,"
17931,Upon my faith and honour.
17932,"As there comes light from heaven and words from breath,"
17933,"As there is sense in truth and truth in virtue,"
17934,I am affianced this man’s wife as strongly
17935,"As words could make up vows. And, my good lord,"
17936,"But Tuesday night last gone, in’s garden-house,"
17937,"He knew me as a wife. As this is true,"
17938,"Let me in safety raise me from my knees,"
17939,"Or else for ever be confixed here,"
17940,I did but smile till now.
17941,"Now, good my lord, give me the scope of justice."
17942,My patience here is touched. I do perceive
17943,These poor informal women are no more
17944,But instruments of some more mightier member
17945,"That sets them on. Let me have way, my lord,"
17946,To find this practice out.
17947,"Ay, with my heart;"
17948,And punish them to your height of pleasure.
17949,"Thou foolish friar, and thou pernicious woman,"
17950,"Compact with her that’s gone, think’st thou thy oaths,"
17951,"Though they would swear down each particular saint,"
17952,"Were testimonies against his worth and credit,"
17953,"That’s sealed in approbation? You, Lord Escalus,"
17954,Sit with my cousin; lend him your kind pains
17955,"To find out this abuse, whence ’tis derived."
17956,There is another friar that set them on;
17957,Let him be sent for.
17958,"Would he were here, my lord; for he indeed"
17959,Hath set the women on to this complaint.
17960,"Your Provost knows the place where he abides,"
17961,And he may fetch him.
17962,"Go, do it instantly."
17963,"And you, my noble and well-warranted cousin,"
17964,"Whom it concerns to hear this matter forth,"
17965,Do with your injuries as seems you best
17966,In any chastisement. I for a while
17967,Will leave you; but stir not you till you have
17968,Well determined upon these slanderers.
17969,"My lord, we’ll do it throughly."
17970,"Signior Lucio, did not you say you knew that Friar Lodowick to be a"
17971,"_Cucullus non facit monachum_, honest in nothing but in his clothes,"
17972,and one that hath spoke most villainous speeches of the Duke.
17973,"We shall entreat you to abide here till he come, and enforce them"
17974,against him. We shall find this friar a notable fellow.
17975,"As any in Vienna, on my word."
17976,Call that same Isabel here once again. I would speak with her.
17977,"Pray you, my lord, give me leave to question; you shall see how I’ll"
17978,"Not better than he, by her own report."
17979,"Marry, sir, I think, if you handled her privately, she would sooner"
17980,"confess; perchance, publicly, she’ll be ashamed."
17981,"Enter at several doors Duke as a friar, Provost and Isabella with"
17982,I will go darkly to work with her.
17983,That’s the way; for women are light at midnight.
17984,that you have said.
17985,"My lord, here comes the rascal I spoke of, here with the Provost."
17986,In very good time. Speak not you to him till we call upon you.
17987,"Come, sir, did you set these women on to slander Lord Angelo? They have"
17988,How! Know you where you are?
17989,Respect to your great place; and let the devil
17990,Be sometime honoured for his burning throne.
17991,Where is the Duke? ’Tis he should hear me speak.
17992,The Duke’s in us; and we will hear you speak.
17993,Look you speak justly.
17994,"Boldly, at least. But, O, poor souls,"
17995,"Come you to seek the lamb here of the fox,"
17996,Good night to your redress! Is the Duke gone?
17997,Then is your cause gone too. The Duke’s unjust
17998,"Thus to retort your manifest appeal,"
17999,And put your trial in the villain’s mouth
18000,Which here you come to accuse.
18001,This is the rascal; this is he I spoke of.
18002,"Why, thou unreverend and unhallowed friar,"
18003,Is’t not enough thou hast suborned these women
18004,"To accuse this worthy man, but, in foul mouth,"
18005,"And in the witness of his proper ear,"
18006,To call him villain? And then to glance from him
18007,"To th’ Duke himself, to tax him with injustice?"
18008,Take him hence! To th’ rack with him! We’ll touse you
18009,"Joint by joint, but we will know his purpose."
18010,Be not so hot. The Duke
18011,Dare no more stretch this finger of mine than he
18012,"Dare rack his own. His subject am I not,"
18013,Nor here provincial. My business in this state
18014,"Made me a looker-on here in Vienna,"
18015,Where I have seen corruption boil and bubble
18016,"Till it o’errun the stew. Laws for all faults,"
18017,But faults so countenanced that the strong statutes
18018,"Stand like the forfeits in a barber’s shop,"
18019,As much in mock as mark.
18020,Slander to the state! Away with him to prison!
18021,"What can you vouch against him, Signior Lucio?"
18022,Is this the man that you did tell us of?
18023,"’Tis he, my lord. Come hither, goodman Baldpate."
18024,Do you know me?
18025,"I remember you, sir, by the sound of your voice. I met you at the"
18026,"prison, in the absence of the Duke."
18027,O did you so? And do you remember what you said of the Duke?
18028,"Do you so, sir? And was the Duke a fleshmonger, a fool, and a coward,"
18029,as you then reported him to be?
18030,"You must, sir, change persons with me ere you make that my report. You"
18031,"indeed spoke so of him, and much more, much worse."
18032,O thou damnable fellow! Did not I pluck thee by the nose for thy
18033,I protest I love the Duke as I love myself.
18034,"Hark how the villain would close now, after his treasonable abuses!"
18035,Such a fellow is not to be talked withal. Away with him to prison!
18036,Where is the provost? Away with him to prison! Lay bolts enough upon
18037,"him. Let him speak no more. Away with those giglets too, and with the"
18038,"Stay, sir, stay a while."
18039,"What, resists he? Help him, Lucio."
18040,"Come, sir, come, sir, come, sir. Foh, sir! Why, you bald-pated lying"
18041,"rascal! You must be hooded, must you? Show your knave’s visage, with a"
18042,"pox to you! Show your sheep-biting face, and be hanged an hour! Will’t"
18043,Thou art the first knave that e’er mad’st a duke.
18044,"First, Provost, let me bail these gentle three."
18045,Must have a word anon.—Lay hold on him.
18046,This may prove worse than hanging.
18047,"We’ll borrow place of him. [_To Angelo_.] Sir, by your leave."
18048,"Hast thou or word, or wit, or impudence,"
18049,"That yet can do thee office? If thou hast,"
18050,"Rely upon it till my tale be heard,"
18051,And hold no longer out.
18052,"O my dread lord,"
18053,I should be guiltier than my guiltiness
18054,"To think I can be undiscernible,"
18055,"When I perceive your Grace, like power divine,"
18056,"Hath looked upon my passes. Then, good Prince,"
18057,"No longer session hold upon my shame,"
18058,But let my trial be mine own confession.
18059,"Immediate sentence then, and sequent death"
18060,Is all the grace I beg.
18061,"Say, wast thou e’er contracted to this woman?"
18062,"I was, my lord."
18063,"Go, take her hence and marry her instantly."
18064,"Do you the office, friar; which consummate,"
18065,"Return him here again.—Go with him, Provost."
18066,"My lord, I am more amazed at his dishonour"
18067,Than at the strangeness of it.
18068,Your friar is now your prince. As I was then
18069,"Advertising and holy to your business,"
18070,"Not changing heart with habit, I am still"
18071,Attorneyed at your service.
18072,"O, give me pardon,"
18073,"That I, your vassal, have employed and pained"
18074,"You are pardoned, Isabel."
18075,"And now, dear maid, be you as free to us."
18076,"Your brother’s death, I know, sits at your heart,"
18077,"And you may marvel why I obscured myself,"
18078,"Labouring to save his life, and would not rather"
18079,Make rash remonstrance of my hidden power
18080,"Than let him so be lost. O most kind maid,"
18081,"It was the swift celerity of his death,"
18082,"Which I did think with slower foot came on,"
18083,That brained my purpose. But peace be with him.
18084,"That life is better life, past fearing death,"
18085,"Than that which lives to fear. Make it your comfort,"
18086,So happy is your brother.
18087,"I do, my lord."
18088,"Enter Angelo, Mariana, Friar Peter and Provost."
18089,"For this new-married man approaching here,"
18090,Whose salt imagination yet hath wronged
18091,"Your well-defended honour, you must pardon"
18092,"For Mariana’s sake. But as he adjudged your brother,"
18093,Being criminal in double violation
18094,Of sacred chastity and of promise-breach
18095,"Thereon dependent, for your brother’s life,"
18096,The very mercy of the law cries out
18097,"Most audible, even from his proper tongue,"
18098,"“An Angelo for Claudio, death for death.”"
18099,"Haste still pays haste, and leisure answers leisure;"
18100,"Like doth quit like, and measure still for measure."
18101,"Then, Angelo, thy fault’s thus manifested,"
18102,"Which, though thou wouldst deny, denies thee vantage."
18103,We do condemn thee to the very block
18104,"Where Claudio stooped to death, and with like haste."
18105,"O my most gracious lord,"
18106,I hope you will not mock me with a husband.
18107,It is your husband mocked you with a husband.
18108,"Consenting to the safeguard of your honour,"
18109,"I thought your marriage fit. Else imputation,"
18110,"For that he knew you, might reproach your life,"
18111,"And choke your good to come. For his possessions,"
18112,"Although by confiscation they are ours,"
18113,We do instate and widow you with all
18114,To buy you a better husband.
18115,"O my dear lord,"
18116,"I crave no other, nor no better man."
18117,Never crave him; we are definitive.
18118,You do but lose your labour.
18119,"Away with him to death. [_To Lucio_.] Now, sir, to you."
18120,"O my good lord.—Sweet Isabel, take my part;"
18121,"Lend me your knees, and all my life to come"
18122,I’ll lend you all my life to do you service.
18123,Against all sense you do importune her.
18124,"Should she kneel down in mercy of this fact,"
18125,"Her brother’s ghost his paved bed would break,"
18126,And take her hence in horror.
18127,"Sweet Isabel, do yet but kneel by me;"
18128,"Hold up your hands, say nothing. I’ll speak all."
18129,"They say best men are moulded out of faults,"
18130,"And, for the most, become much more the better"
18131,For being a little bad. So may my husband.
18132,"O Isabel, will you not lend a knee?"
18133,He dies for Claudio’s death.
18134,"Look, if it please you, on this man condemned"
18135,As if my brother lived. I partly think
18136,A due sincerity governed his deeds
18137,"Till he did look on me. Since it is so,"
18138,"Let him not die. My brother had but justice,"
18139,In that he did the thing for which he died.
18140,"His act did not o’ertake his bad intent,"
18141,And must be buried but as an intent
18142,That perished by the way. Thoughts are no subjects;
18143,Intents but merely thoughts.
18144,"Your suit’s unprofitable. Stand up, I say."
18145,I have bethought me of another fault.
18146,"Provost, how came it Claudio was beheaded"
18147,At an unusual hour?
18148,It was commanded so.
18149,Had you a special warrant for the deed?
18150,"No, my good lord, it was by private message."
18151,For which I do discharge you of your office.
18152,Give up your keys.
18153,"Pardon me, noble lord."
18154,"I thought it was a fault, but knew it not;"
18155,Yet did repent me after more advice.
18156,"For testimony whereof, one in the prison"
18157,"That should by private order else have died,"
18158,I have reserved alive.
18159,His name is Barnardine.
18160,I would thou hadst done so by Claudio.
18161,"Go fetch him hither, let me look upon him."
18162,I am sorry one so learned and so wise
18163,"As you, Lord Angelo, have still appeared,"
18164,"Should slip so grossly, both in the heat of blood"
18165,And lack of tempered judgement afterward.
18166,"I am sorry that such sorrow I procure,"
18167,And so deep sticks it in my penitent heart
18168,That I crave death more willingly than mercy;
18169,"’Tis my deserving, and I do entreat it."
18170,"Enter Provost with Barnardine, Claudio (muffled) and Juliet."
18171,Which is that Barnardine?
18172,There was a friar told me of this man.
18173,"Sirrah, thou art said to have a stubborn soul"
18174,"That apprehends no further than this world,"
18175,And squar’st thy life according. Thou’rt condemned;
18176,"But, for those earthly faults, I quit them all,"
18177,And pray thee take this mercy to provide
18178,"For better times to come. Friar, advise him;"
18179,I leave him to your hand.—What muffled fellow’s that?
18180,"This is another prisoner that I saved,"
18181,Who should have died when Claudio lost his head;
18182,As like almost to Claudio as himself.
18183,"Is he pardoned; and for your lovely sake,"
18184,Give me your hand and say you will be mine.
18185,He is my brother too. But fitter time for that.
18186,By this Lord Angelo perceives he’s safe;
18187,Methinks I see a quick’ning in his eye.
18188,"Well, Angelo, your evil quits you well."
18189,"Look that you love your wife, her worth worth yours."
18190,I find an apt remission in myself.
18191,And yet here’s one in place I cannot pardon.
18192,"One all of luxury, an ass, a madman."
18193,Wherein have I so deserved of you
18194,That you extol me thus?
18195,"Faith, my lord, I spoke it but according to the trick. If you will hang"
18196,"me for it, you may, but I had rather it would please you I might be"
18197,"Whipped first, sir, and hanged after."
18198,"Proclaim it, Provost, round about the city,"
18199,"If any woman wronged by this lewd fellow,"
18200,As I have heard him swear himself there’s one
18201,"Whom he begot with child—let her appear,"
18202,"And he shall marry her. The nuptial finished,"
18203,Let him be whipped and hanged.
18204,"I beseech your Highness, do not marry me to a whore. Your highness said"
18205,"even now I made you a duke; good my lord, do not recompense me in"
18206,making me a cuckold.
18207,"Upon mine honour, thou shalt marry her."
18208,"Thy slanders I forgive, and therewithal"
18209,"Remit thy other forfeits.—Take him to prison,"
18210,And see our pleasure herein executed.
18211,"Marrying a punk, my lord, is pressing to death, whipping, and hanging."
18212,Slandering a prince deserves it.
18213,"She, Claudio, that you wronged, look you restore."
18214,"Joy to you, Mariana! Love her, Angelo."
18215,"I have confessed her, and I know her virtue."
18216,"Thanks, good friend Escalus, for thy much goodness;"
18217,There’s more behind that is more gratulate.
18218,"Thanks, Provost, for thy care and secrecy;"
18219,We shall employ thee in a worthier place.
18220,"Forgive him, Angelo, that brought you home"
18221,The head of Ragozine for Claudio’s.
18222,"Th’ offence pardons itself. Dear Isabel,"
18223,I have a motion much imports your good;
18224,"Whereto if you’ll a willing ear incline,"
18225,"What’s mine is yours, and what is yours is mine."
18226,"So, bring us to our palace, where we’ll show"
18227,What’s yet behind that’s meet you all should know.

18269,SCENE I. Venice. A street.
18270,"Enter Antonio, Salarino and Solanio."
18271,"In sooth I know not why I am so sad,"
18272,"It wearies me, you say it wearies you;"
18273,"But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,"
18274,"What stuff ’tis made of, whereof it is born,"
18275,I am to learn.
18276,"And such a want-wit sadness makes of me,"
18277,That I have much ado to know myself.
18278,"Your mind is tossing on the ocean,"
18279,"There where your argosies, with portly sail"
18280,"Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood,"
18281,"Or as it were the pageants of the sea,"
18282,Do overpeer the petty traffickers
18283,"That curtsy to them, do them reverence,"
18284,As they fly by them with their woven wings.
18285,"Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,"
18286,The better part of my affections would
18287,Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still
18288,"Plucking the grass to know where sits the wind,"
18289,"Peering in maps for ports, and piers and roads;"
18290,And every object that might make me fear
18291,"Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt"
18292,Would make me sad.
18293,My wind cooling my broth
18294,Would blow me to an ague when I thought
18295,What harm a wind too great might do at sea.
18296,I should not see the sandy hour-glass run
18297,"But I should think of shallows and of flats,"
18298,"And see my wealthy Andrew dock’d in sand,"
18299,Vailing her high top lower than her ribs
18300,To kiss her burial. Should I go to church
18301,And see the holy edifice of stone
18302,"And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,"
18303,"Which, touching but my gentle vessel’s side,"
18304,"Would scatter all her spices on the stream,"
18305,"Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,"
18306,"And, in a word, but even now worth this,"
18307,And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought
18308,"To think on this, and shall I lack the thought"
18309,That such a thing bechanc’d would make me sad?
18310,"But tell not me, I know Antonio"
18311,Is sad to think upon his merchandise.
18312,"Believe me, no. I thank my fortune for it,"
18313,"My ventures are not in one bottom trusted,"
18314,Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate
18315,Upon the fortune of this present year.
18316,Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.
18317,Why then you are in love.
18318,Not in love neither? Then let us say you are sad
18319,Because you are not merry; and ’twere as easy
18320,For you to laugh and leap and say you are merry
18321,"Because you are not sad. Now, by two-headed Janus,"
18322,Nature hath fram’d strange fellows in her time:
18323,"Some that will evermore peep through their eyes,"
18324,And laugh like parrots at a bagpiper.
18325,And other of such vinegar aspect
18326,That they’ll not show their teeth in way of smile
18327,Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable.
18328,"Enter Bassanio, Lorenzo and Gratiano."
18329,"Here comes Bassanio, your most noble kinsman,"
18330,"Gratiano, and Lorenzo. Fare ye well."
18331,We leave you now with better company.
18332,"I would have stay’d till I had made you merry,"
18333,If worthier friends had not prevented me.
18334,Your worth is very dear in my regard.
18335,"I take it your own business calls on you,"
18336,And you embrace th’ occasion to depart.
18337,"Good morrow, my good lords."
18338,"Good signiors both, when shall we laugh? Say, when?"
18339,You grow exceeding strange. Must it be so?
18340,We’ll make our leisures to attend on yours.
18341,"My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio,"
18342,"We two will leave you, but at dinner-time"
18343,I pray you have in mind where we must meet.
18344,I will not fail you.
18345,"You look not well, Signior Antonio,"
18346,You have too much respect upon the world.
18347,They lose it that do buy it with much care.
18348,"Believe me, you are marvellously chang’d."
18349,"I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano,"
18350,"A stage, where every man must play a part,"
18351,And mine a sad one.
18352,"Let me play the fool,"
18353,"With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come,"
18354,And let my liver rather heat with wine
18355,Than my heart cool with mortifying groans.
18356,Why should a man whose blood is warm within
18357,Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster?
18358,Sleep when he wakes? And creep into the jaundice
18359,"By being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio,"
18360,There are a sort of men whose visages
18361,"Do cream and mantle like a standing pond,"
18362,"And do a wilful stillness entertain,"
18363,With purpose to be dress’d in an opinion
18364,"Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit,"
18365,"As who should say, “I am Sir Oracle,"
18366,"And when I ope my lips, let no dog bark.”"
18367,"O my Antonio, I do know of these"
18368,That therefore only are reputed wise
18369,"For saying nothing; when, I am very sure,"
18370,"If they should speak, would almost damn those ears"
18371,"Which, hearing them, would call their brothers fools."
18372,I’ll tell thee more of this another time.
18373,But fish not with this melancholy bait
18374,"For this fool gudgeon, this opinion."
18375,"Come, good Lorenzo. Fare ye well a while."
18376,I’ll end my exhortation after dinner.
18377,"Well, we will leave you then till dinner-time."
18378,"I must be one of these same dumb wise men,"
18379,For Gratiano never lets me speak.
18380,"Well, keep me company but two years moe,"
18381,Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue.
18382,Fare you well. I’ll grow a talker for this gear.
18383,"Thanks, i’ faith, for silence is only commendable"
18384,"In a neat’s tongue dried, and a maid not vendible."
18385,Is that anything now?
18386,"Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more than any man in all"
18387,Venice. His reasons are as two grains of wheat hid in two bushels of
18388,"chaff: you shall seek all day ere you find them, and when you have them"
18389,they are not worth the search.
18390,"Well, tell me now what lady is the same"
18391,"To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage,"
18392,That you today promis’d to tell me of?
18393,"’Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,"
18394,How much I have disabled mine estate
18395,By something showing a more swelling port
18396,Than my faint means would grant continuance.
18397,Nor do I now make moan to be abridg’d
18398,"From such a noble rate, but my chief care"
18399,Is to come fairly off from the great debts
18400,"Wherein my time, something too prodigal,"
18401,"Hath left me gag’d. To you, Antonio,"
18402,"I owe the most in money and in love,"
18403,And from your love I have a warranty
18404,To unburden all my plots and purposes
18405,How to get clear of all the debts I owe.
18406,"I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;"
18407,"And if it stand, as you yourself still do,"
18408,"Within the eye of honour, be assur’d"
18409,"My purse, my person, my extremest means"
18410,Lie all unlock’d to your occasions.
18411,"In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,"
18412,I shot his fellow of the self-same flight
18413,"The self-same way, with more advised watch"
18414,To find the other forth; and by adventuring both
18415,I oft found both. I urge this childhood proof
18416,Because what follows is pure innocence.
18417,"I owe you much, and, like a wilful youth,"
18418,That which I owe is lost. But if you please
18419,To shoot another arrow that self way
18420,"Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,"
18421,"As I will watch the aim, or to find both,"
18422,"Or bring your latter hazard back again,"
18423,And thankfully rest debtor for the first.
18424,"You know me well, and herein spend but time"
18425,To wind about my love with circumstance;
18426,And out of doubt you do me now more wrong
18427,In making question of my uttermost
18428,Than if you had made waste of all I have.
18429,Then do but say to me what I should do
18430,"That in your knowledge may by me be done,"
18431,"And I am prest unto it. Therefore, speak."
18432,"In Belmont is a lady richly left,"
18433,"And she is fair, and, fairer than that word,"
18434,Of wondrous virtues. Sometimes from her eyes
18435,I did receive fair speechless messages:
18436,"Her name is Portia, nothing undervalu’d"
18437,"To Cato’s daughter, Brutus’ Portia."
18438,"Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth,"
18439,For the four winds blow in from every coast
18440,"Renowned suitors, and her sunny locks"
18441,"Hang on her temples like a golden fleece,"
18442,"Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos’ strond,"
18443,And many Jasons come in quest of her.
18444,"O my Antonio, had I but the means"
18445,"To hold a rival place with one of them,"
18446,I have a mind presages me such thrift
18447,That I should questionless be fortunate.
18448,Thou know’st that all my fortunes are at sea;
18449,Neither have I money nor commodity
18450,"To raise a present sum, therefore go forth"
18451,Try what my credit can in Venice do;
18452,"That shall be rack’d even to the uttermost,"
18453,To furnish thee to Belmont to fair Portia.
18454,"Go presently inquire, and so will I,"
18455,"Where money is, and I no question make"
18456,To have it of my trust or for my sake.
18457,SCENE II. Belmont. A room in Portia’s house.
18458,Enter Portia with her waiting-woman Nerissa.
18459,"By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary of this great world."
18460,"You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in the same abundance"
18461,"as your good fortunes are. And yet, for aught I see, they are as sick"
18462,that surfeit with too much as they that starve with nothing. It is no
18463,"mean happiness, therefore, to be seated in the mean. Superfluity come"
18464,"sooner by white hairs, but competency lives longer."
18465,"Good sentences, and well pronounc’d."
18466,They would be better if well followed.
18467,"If to do were as easy as to know what were good to do, chapels had been"
18468,"churches, and poor men’s cottages princes’ palaces. It is a good divine"
18469,that follows his own instructions; I can easier teach twenty what were
18470,good to be done than to be one of the twenty to follow mine own
18471,"teaching. The brain may devise laws for the blood, but a hot temper"
18472,"leaps o’er a cold decree; such a hare is madness the youth, to skip"
18473,o’er the meshes of good counsel the cripple. But this reasoning is not
18474,"in the fashion to choose me a husband. O me, the word “choose”! I may"
18475,"neither choose who I would nor refuse who I dislike, so is the will of"
18476,"a living daughter curb’d by the will of a dead father. Is it not hard,"
18477,"Nerissa, that I cannot choose one, nor refuse none?"
18478,"Your father was ever virtuous, and holy men at their death have good"
18479,inspirations. Therefore the lott’ry that he hath devised in these three
18480,"chests of gold, silver, and lead, whereof who chooses his meaning"
18481,"chooses you, will no doubt never be chosen by any rightly but one who"
18482,you shall rightly love. But what warmth is there in your affection
18483,towards any of these princely suitors that are already come?
18484,"I pray thee over-name them, and as thou namest them, I will describe"
18485,"them, and according to my description level at my affection."
18486,"First, there is the Neapolitan prince."
18487,"Ay, that’s a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but talk of his horse,"
18488,and he makes it a great appropriation to his own good parts that he can
18489,shoe him himself. I am much afeard my lady his mother play’d false with
18490,Then is there the County Palatine.
18491,"He doth nothing but frown, as who should say “And you will not have me,"
18492,choose.” He hears merry tales and smiles not. I fear he will prove the
18493,"weeping philosopher when he grows old, being so full of unmannerly"
18494,sadness in his youth. I had rather be married to a death’s-head with a
18495,bone in his mouth than to either of these. God defend me from these
18496,"How say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon?"
18497,"God made him, and therefore let him pass for a man. In truth, I know it"
18498,"is a sin to be a mocker, but he! why, he hath a horse better than the"
18499,"Neapolitan’s, a better bad habit of frowning than the Count Palatine."
18500,"He is every man in no man. If a throstle sing, he falls straight"
18501,"a-cap’ring. He will fence with his own shadow. If I should marry him, I"
18502,"should marry twenty husbands. If he would despise me, I would forgive"
18503,"him, for if he love me to madness, I shall never requite him."
18504,"What say you then to Falconbridge, the young baron of England?"
18505,"You know I say nothing to him, for he understands not me, nor I him: he"
18506,"hath neither Latin, French, nor Italian, and you will come into the"
18507,court and swear that I have a poor pennyworth in the English. He is a
18508,"proper man’s picture; but alas, who can converse with a dumb-show? How"
18509,"oddly he is suited! I think he bought his doublet in Italy, his round"
18510,"hose in France, his bonnet in Germany, and his behaviour everywhere."
18511,"What think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbour?"
18512,"That he hath a neighbourly charity in him, for he borrowed a box of the"
18513,"ear of the Englishman, and swore he would pay him again when he was"
18514,"able. I think the Frenchman became his surety, and seal’d under for"
18515,"How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony’s nephew?"
18516,"Very vilely in the morning when he is sober, and most vilely in the"
18517,"afternoon when he is drunk: when he is best, he is a little worse than"
18518,"a man, and when he is worst, he is little better than a beast. And the"
18519,"worst fall that ever fell, I hope I shall make shift to go without him."
18520,"If he should offer to choose, and choose the right casket, you should"
18521,"refuse to perform your father’s will, if you should refuse to accept"
18522,"Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee set a deep glass of"
18523,"Rhenish wine on the contrary casket, for if the devil be within and"
18524,"that temptation without, I know he will choose it. I will do anything,"
18525,"Nerissa, ere I will be married to a sponge."
18526,"You need not fear, lady, the having any of these lords. They have"
18527,"acquainted me with their determinations, which is indeed to return to"
18528,"their home, and to trouble you with no more suit, unless you may be won"
18529,"by some other sort than your father’s imposition, depending on the"
18530,"If I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as chaste as Diana,"
18531,unless I be obtained by the manner of my father’s will. I am glad this
18532,"parcel of wooers are so reasonable, for there is not one among them but"
18533,I dote on his very absence. And I pray God grant them a fair departure.
18534,"Do you not remember, lady, in your father’s time, a Venetian, a scholar"
18535,"and a soldier, that came hither in company of the Marquis of"
18536,"Yes, yes, it was Bassanio, as I think, so was he call’d."
18537,"True, madam. He, of all the men that ever my foolish eyes look’d upon,"
18538,was the best deserving a fair lady.
18539,"I remember him well, and I remember him worthy of thy praise."
18540,How now! what news?
18541,"The four strangers seek for you, madam, to take their leave. And there"
18542,"is a forerunner come from a fifth, the Prince of Morocco, who brings"
18543,word the Prince his master will be here tonight.
18544,If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good heart as I can bid the
18545,"other four farewell, I should be glad of his approach. If he have the"
18546,"condition of a saint and the complexion of a devil, I had rather he"
18547,"should shrive me than wive me. Come, Nerissa. Sirrah, go before. Whiles"
18548,"we shut the gate upon one wooer, another knocks at the door."
18549,SCENE III. Venice. A public place.
18550,Enter Bassanio with Shylock the Jew.
18551,"Three thousand ducats, well."
18552,"Ay, sir, for three months."
18553,"For three months, well."
18554,"For the which, as I told you, Antonio shall be bound."
18555,"Antonio shall become bound, well."
18556,May you stead me? Will you pleasure me? Shall I know your answer?
18557,"Three thousand ducats for three months, and Antonio bound."
18558,Your answer to that.
18559,Antonio is a good man.
18560,Have you heard any imputation to the contrary?
18561,"Ho, no, no, no, no: my meaning in saying he is a good man is to have"
18562,you understand me that he is sufficient. Yet his means are in
18563,"supposition: he hath an argosy bound to Tripolis, another to the"
18564,"Indies. I understand, moreover, upon the Rialto, he hath a third at"
18565,"Mexico, a fourth for England, and other ventures he hath squandered"
18566,"abroad. But ships are but boards, sailors but men; there be land-rats"
18567,"and water-rats, water-thieves and land-thieves—I mean pirates—and then"
18568,"there is the peril of waters, winds, and rocks. The man is,"
18569,"notwithstanding, sufficient. Three thousand ducats. I think I may take"
18570,Be assured you may.
18571,"I will be assured I may. And that I may be assured, I will bethink me."
18572,May I speak with Antonio?
18573,If it please you to dine with us.
18574,"Yes, to smell pork, to eat of the habitation which your prophet, the"
18575,"Nazarite, conjured the devil into. I will buy with you, sell with you,"
18576,"talk with you, walk with you, and so following; but I will not eat with"
18577,"you, drink with you, nor pray with you. What news on the Rialto? Who is"
18578,This is Signior Antonio.
18579,"I hate him for he is a Christian,"
18580,But more for that in low simplicity
18581,"He lends out money gratis, and brings down"
18582,The rate of usance here with us in Venice.
18583,"If I can catch him once upon the hip,"
18584,I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him.
18585,"He hates our sacred nation, and he rails,"
18586,"Even there where merchants most do congregate,"
18587,"On me, my bargains, and my well-won thrift,"
18588,Which he calls interest. Cursed be my tribe
18589,If I forgive him!
18590,"Shylock, do you hear?"
18591,"I am debating of my present store,"
18592,And by the near guess of my memory
18593,I cannot instantly raise up the gross
18594,Of full three thousand ducats. What of that?
18595,"Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe,"
18596,Will furnish me. But soft! how many months
18597,"Do you desire? [_To Antonio._] Rest you fair, good signior,"
18598,Your worship was the last man in our mouths.
18599,"Shylock, albeit I neither lend nor borrow"
18600,"By taking nor by giving of excess,"
18601,"Yet to supply the ripe wants of my friend,"
18602,I’ll break a custom. [_To Bassanio._] Is he yet possess’d
18603,How much ye would?
18604,"Ay, ay, three thousand ducats."
18605,And for three months.
18606,"I had forgot, three months, you told me so."
18607,"Well then, your bond. And let me see, but hear you,"
18608,Methought you said you neither lend nor borrow
18609,I do never use it.
18610,"When Jacob graz’d his uncle Laban’s sheep,—"
18611,This Jacob from our holy Abram was
18612,"As his wise mother wrought in his behalf,"
18613,"The third possessor; ay, he was the third."
18614,And what of him? Did he take interest?
18615,"No, not take interest, not, as you would say,"
18616,Directly interest; mark what Jacob did.
18617,When Laban and himself were compromis’d
18618,That all the eanlings which were streak’d and pied
18619,"Should fall as Jacob’s hire, the ewes being rank"
18620,"In end of autumn turned to the rams,"
18621,And when the work of generation was
18622,"Between these woolly breeders in the act,"
18623,"The skilful shepherd pill’d me certain wands,"
18624,"And in the doing of the deed of kind,"
18625,"He stuck them up before the fulsome ewes,"
18626,Who then conceiving did in eaning time
18627,"Fall parti-colour’d lambs, and those were Jacob’s."
18628,"This was a way to thrive, and he was blest;"
18629,And thrift is blessing if men steal it not.
18630,"This was a venture, sir, that Jacob serv’d for,"
18631,"A thing not in his power to bring to pass,"
18632,But sway’d and fashion’d by the hand of heaven.
18633,Was this inserted to make interest good?
18634,Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?
18635,I cannot tell; I make it breed as fast.
18636,"But note me, signior."
18637,"Mark you this, Bassanio,"
18638,The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.
18639,An evil soul producing holy witness
18640,"Is like a villain with a smiling cheek,"
18641,A goodly apple rotten at the heart.
18642,"O, what a goodly outside falsehood hath!"
18643,"Three thousand ducats, ’tis a good round sum."
18644,"Three months from twelve, then let me see the rate."
18645,"Well, Shylock, shall we be beholding to you?"
18646,"Signior Antonio, many a time and oft"
18647,In the Rialto you have rated me
18648,About my moneys and my usances.
18649,"Still have I borne it with a patient shrug,"
18650,"You call me misbeliever, cut-throat dog,"
18651,"And spet upon my Jewish gaberdine,"
18652,And all for use of that which is mine own.
18653,"Well then, it now appears you need my help."
18654,"Go to, then, you come to me, and you say"
18655,"“Shylock, we would have moneys.” You say so:"
18656,"You that did void your rheum upon my beard,"
18657,And foot me as you spurn a stranger cur
18658,"Over your threshold, moneys is your suit."
18659,What should I say to you? Should I not say
18660,“Hath a dog money? Is it possible
18661,A cur can lend three thousand ducats?” Or
18662,"Shall I bend low and, in a bondman’s key,"
18663,"With bated breath and whisp’ring humbleness,"
18664,"“Fair sir, you spet on me on Wednesday last;"
18665,You spurn’d me such a day; another time
18666,You call’d me dog; and for these courtesies
18667,I’ll lend you thus much moneys”?
18668,"I am as like to call thee so again,"
18669,"To spet on thee again, to spurn thee too."
18670,"If thou wilt lend this money, lend it not"
18671,"As to thy friends, for when did friendship take"
18672,A breed for barren metal of his friend?
18673,"But lend it rather to thine enemy,"
18674,"Who if he break, thou mayst with better face"
18675,"Why, look you how you storm!"
18676,"I would be friends with you, and have your love,"
18677,"Forget the shames that you have stain’d me with,"
18678,"Supply your present wants, and take no doit"
18679,"Of usance for my moneys, and you’ll not hear me,"
18680,This is kind I offer.
18681,This kindness will I show.
18682,"Go with me to a notary, seal me there"
18683,"Your single bond; and in a merry sport,"
18684,"If you repay me not on such a day,"
18685,"In such a place, such sum or sums as are"
18686,"Express’d in the condition, let the forfeit"
18687,Be nominated for an equal pound
18688,"Of your fair flesh, to be cut off and taken"
18689,In what part of your body pleaseth me.
18690,"Content, in faith, I’ll seal to such a bond,"
18691,And say there is much kindness in the Jew.
18692,"You shall not seal to such a bond for me,"
18693,I’ll rather dwell in my necessity.
18694,"Why, fear not, man, I will not forfeit it,"
18695,"Within these two months, that’s a month before"
18696,"This bond expires, I do expect return"
18697,Of thrice three times the value of this bond.
18698,"O father Abram, what these Christians are,"
18699,Whose own hard dealings teaches them suspect
18700,"The thoughts of others. Pray you, tell me this,"
18701,"If he should break his day, what should I gain"
18702,By the exaction of the forfeiture?
18703,"A pound of man’s flesh, taken from a man,"
18704,"Is not so estimable, profitable neither,"
18705,"As flesh of muttons, beefs, or goats. I say,"
18706,"To buy his favour, I extend this friendship."
18707,"If he will take it, so. If not, adieu,"
18708,And for my love I pray you wrong me not.
18709,"Yes, Shylock, I will seal unto this bond."
18710,"Then meet me forthwith at the notary’s,"
18711,"Give him direction for this merry bond,"
18712,"And I will go and purse the ducats straight,"
18713,See to my house left in the fearful guard
18714,"Of an unthrifty knave, and presently"
18715,I’ll be with you.
18716,"Hie thee, gentle Jew."
18717,This Hebrew will turn Christian; he grows kind.
18718,I like not fair terms and a villain’s mind.
18719,Come on; in this there can be no dismay;
18720,My ships come home a month before the day.
18721,SCENE I. Belmont. A room in Portia’s house.
18722,"Flourish of cornets. Enter the Prince of Morocco, a tawny Moor all in"
18723,"white, and three or four followers accordingly, with Portia, Nerissa"
18724,"Mislike me not for my complexion,"
18725,"The shadowed livery of the burnish’d sun,"
18726,"To whom I am a neighbour, and near bred."
18727,"Bring me the fairest creature northward born,"
18728,"Where Phœbus’ fire scarce thaws the icicles,"
18729,And let us make incision for your love
18730,"To prove whose blood is reddest, his or mine."
18731,"I tell thee, lady, this aspect of mine"
18732,Hath fear’d the valiant; by my love I swear
18733,The best-regarded virgins of our clime
18734,"Have lov’d it too. I would not change this hue,"
18735,"Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen."
18736,In terms of choice I am not solely led
18737,By nice direction of a maiden’s eyes;
18738,"Besides, the lott’ry of my destiny"
18739,Bars me the right of voluntary choosing.
18740,But if my father had not scanted me
18741,And hedg’d me by his wit to yield myself
18742,"His wife who wins me by that means I told you,"
18743,"Yourself, renowned Prince, then stood as fair"
18744,As any comer I have look’d on yet
18745,Even for that I thank you.
18746,Therefore I pray you lead me to the caskets
18747,To try my fortune. By this scimitar
18748,"That slew the Sophy and a Persian prince,"
18749,"That won three fields of Sultan Solyman,"
18750,"I would o’erstare the sternest eyes that look,"
18751,"Outbrave the heart most daring on the earth,"
18752,"Pluck the young sucking cubs from the she-bear,"
18753,"Yea, mock the lion when he roars for prey,"
18754,"To win thee, lady. But, alas the while!"
18755,If Hercules and Lichas play at dice
18756,"Which is the better man, the greater throw"
18757,May turn by fortune from the weaker hand:
18758,"So is Alcides beaten by his rage,"
18759,"And so may I, blind Fortune leading me,"
18760,"Miss that which one unworthier may attain,"
18761,And die with grieving.
18762,"You must take your chance,"
18763,"And either not attempt to choose at all,"
18764,"Or swear before you choose, if you choose wrong"
18765,Never to speak to lady afterward
18766,In way of marriage. Therefore be advis’d.
18767,"Nor will not. Come, bring me unto my chance."
18768,"First, forward to the temple. After dinner"
18769,Your hazard shall be made.
18770,To make me blest or cursed’st among men!
18771,SCENE II. Venice. A street.
18772,"Enter Launcelet Gobbo, the clown, alone."
18773,Certainly my conscience will serve me to run from this Jew my master.
18774,"The fiend is at mine elbow and tempts me, saying to me “Gobbo,"
18775,"Launcelet Gobbo, good Launcelet” or “good Gobbo,” or “good Launcelet"
18776,"Gobbo, use your legs, take the start, run away.” My conscience says"
18777,"“No; take heed, honest Launcelet, take heed, honest Gobbo” or, as"
18778,"aforesaid, “honest Launcelet Gobbo, do not run, scorn running with thy"
18779,"heels.” Well, the most courageous fiend bids me pack. “Fia!” says the"
18780,"fiend, “away!” says the fiend. “For the heavens, rouse up a brave"
18781,"mind,” says the fiend, “and run.” Well, my conscience, hanging about"
18782,"the neck of my heart, says very wisely to me “My honest friend"
18783,"Launcelet, being an honest man’s son”—or rather an honest woman’s son,"
18784,"for indeed my father did something smack, something grow to, he had a"
18785,"kind of taste;—well, my conscience says “Launcelet, budge not.”"
18786,"“Budge,” says the fiend. “Budge not,” says my conscience. “Conscience,”"
18787,"say I, “you counsel well.” “Fiend,” say I, “you counsel well.” To be"
18788,"ruled by my conscience, I should stay with the Jew my master, who, (God"
18789,"bless the mark) is a kind of devil; and, to run away from the Jew, I"
18790,"should be ruled by the fiend, who (saving your reverence) is the devil"
18791,"himself. Certainly the Jew is the very devil incarnation, and, in my"
18792,"conscience, my conscience is but a kind of hard conscience, to offer to"
18793,counsel me to stay with the Jew. The fiend gives the more friendly
18794,"counsel. I will run, fiend, my heels are at your commandment, I will"
18795,Enter Old Gobbo with a basket.
18796,"Master young man, you, I pray you; which is the way to Master Jew’s?"
18797,"than sand-blind, high-gravel blind, knows me not. I will try confusions"
18798,"Master young gentleman, I pray you, which is the way to Master Jew’s?"
18799,"Turn up on your right hand at the next turning, but at the next turning"
18800,"of all on your left; marry, at the very next turning, turn of no hand,"
18801,but turn down indirectly to the Jew’s house.
18802,"Be God’s sonties, ’twill be a hard way to hit. Can you tell me whether"
18803,"one Launcelet, that dwells with him, dwell with him or no?"
18804,"Talk you of young Master Launcelet? [_Aside._] Mark me now, now will I"
18805,raise the waters. Talk you of young Master Launcelet?
18806,"No master, sir, but a poor man’s son, his father, though I say’t, is an"
18807,"honest exceeding poor man, and, God be thanked, well to live."
18808,"Well, let his father be what he will, we talk of young Master"
18809,"Your worship’s friend, and Launcelet, sir."
18810,"But I pray you, _ergo_, old man, _ergo_, I beseech you, talk you of"
18811,"Of Launcelet, an’t please your mastership."
18812,"_Ergo_, Master Launcelet. Talk not of Master Launcelet, father, for the"
18813,"young gentleman, according to Fates and Destinies, and such odd"
18814,"sayings, the Sisters Three and such branches of learning, is indeed"
18815,"deceased, or, as you would say in plain terms, gone to heaven."
18816,"Marry, God forbid! The boy was the very staff of my age, my very prop."
18817,"Do you know me, father?"
18818,"Alack the day! I know you not, young gentleman, but I pray you tell me,"
18819,"is my boy, God rest his soul, alive or dead?"
18820,"Do you not know me, father?"
18821,"Alack, sir, I am sand-blind, I know you not."
18822,"Nay, indeed, if you had your eyes, you might fail of the knowing me: it"
18823,"is a wise father that knows his own child. Well, old man, I will tell"
18824,"you news of your son. Give me your blessing, truth will come to light,"
18825,"murder cannot be hid long, a man’s son may, but in the end truth will"
18826,"Pray you, sir, stand up, I am sure you are not Launcelet my boy."
18827,"Pray you, let’s have no more fooling about it, but give me your"
18828,"blessing. I am Launcelet, your boy that was, your son that is, your"
18829,child that shall be.
18830,I cannot think you are my son.
18831,"I know not what I shall think of that; but I am Launcelet, the Jew’s"
18832,"man, and I am sure Margery your wife is my mother."
18833,"Her name is Margery, indeed. I’ll be sworn if thou be Launcelet, thou"
18834,"art mine own flesh and blood. Lord worshipped might he be, what a beard"
18835,hast thou got! Thou hast got more hair on thy chin than Dobbin my
18836,fill-horse has on his tail.
18837,"It should seem, then, that Dobbin’s tail grows backward. I am sure he"
18838,had more hair on his tail than I have on my face when I last saw him.
18839,"Lord, how art thou changed! How dost thou and thy master agree? I have"
18840,brought him a present. How ’gree you now?
18841,"Well, well. But for mine own part, as I have set up my rest to run"
18842,"away, so I will not rest till I have run some ground. My master’s a"
18843,very Jew. Give him a present! Give him a halter. I am famished in his
18844,"service. You may tell every finger I have with my ribs. Father, I am"
18845,"glad you are come, give me your present to one Master Bassanio, who"
18846,"indeed gives rare new liveries. If I serve not him, I will run as far"
18847,"as God has any ground. O rare fortune, here comes the man! To him,"
18848,"father; for I am a Jew, if I serve the Jew any longer."
18849,Enter Bassanio with Leonardo and a follower or two.
18850,"You may do so, but let it be so hasted that supper be ready at the"
18851,"farthest by five of the clock. See these letters delivered, put the"
18852,"liveries to making, and desire Gratiano to come anon to my lodging."
18853,God bless your worship!
18854,"Gramercy, wouldst thou aught with me?"
18855,"Here’s my son, sir, a poor boy."
18856,"Not a poor boy, sir, but the rich Jew’s man, that would, sir, as my"
18857,"He hath a great infection, sir, as one would say, to serve."
18858,"Indeed the short and the long is, I serve the Jew, and have a desire,"
18859,as my father shall specify.
18860,His master and he (saving your worship’s reverence) are scarce
18861,"To be brief, the very truth is that the Jew, having done me wrong, doth"
18862,"cause me, as my father, being I hope an old man, shall frutify unto"
18863,"I have here a dish of doves that I would bestow upon your worship, and"
18864,"In very brief, the suit is impertinent to myself, as your worship shall"
18865,"know by this honest old man, and though I say it, though old man, yet"
18866,"poor man, my father."
18867,One speak for both. What would you?
18868,"That is the very defect of the matter, sir."
18869,I know thee well; thou hast obtain’d thy suit.
18870,"Shylock thy master spoke with me this day,"
18871,"And hath preferr’d thee, if it be preferment"
18872,To leave a rich Jew’s service to become
18873,The follower of so poor a gentleman.
18874,"The old proverb is very well parted between my master Shylock and you,"
18875,"sir: you have “the grace of God”, sir, and he hath “enough”."
18876,"Thou speak’st it well. Go, father, with thy son."
18877,"Take leave of thy old master, and inquire"
18878,My lodging out. [_To a Servant._] Give him a livery
18879,More guarded than his fellows’; see it done.
18880,"Father, in. I cannot get a service, no! I have ne’er a tongue in my"
18881,"head! [_Looking on his palm._] Well, if any man in Italy have a fairer"
18882,"table which doth offer to swear upon a book, I shall have good fortune;"
18883,"go to, here’s a simple line of life. Here’s a small trifle of wives,"
18884,"alas, fifteen wives is nothing; eleven widows and nine maids is a"
18885,"simple coming-in for one man. And then to scape drowning thrice, and to"
18886,be in peril of my life with the edge of a feather-bed; here are simple
18887,"’scapes. Well, if Fortune be a woman, she’s a good wench for this gear."
18888,"Father, come; I’ll take my leave of the Jew in the twinkling."
18889,"I pray thee, good Leonardo, think on this."
18890,"These things being bought and orderly bestow’d,"
18891,"Return in haste, for I do feast tonight"
18892,"My best esteem’d acquaintance; hie thee, go."
18893,My best endeavours shall be done herein.
18894,"Yonder, sir, he walks."
18895,I have suit to you.
18896,You have obtain’d it.
18897,"You must not deny me, I must go with you to Belmont."
18898,"Why, then you must. But hear thee, Gratiano,"
18899,"Thou art too wild, too rude, and bold of voice,"
18900,"Parts that become thee happily enough,"
18901,And in such eyes as ours appear not faults;
18902,"But where thou art not known, why there they show"
18903,"Something too liberal. Pray thee, take pain"
18904,To allay with some cold drops of modesty
18905,"Thy skipping spirit, lest through thy wild behaviour"
18906,"I be misconst’red in the place I go to,"
18907,And lose my hopes.
18908,"Signior Bassanio, hear me."
18909,"If I do not put on a sober habit,"
18910,"Talk with respect, and swear but now and then,"
18911,"Wear prayer-books in my pocket, look demurely,"
18912,"Nay more, while grace is saying, hood mine eyes"
18913,"Thus with my hat, and sigh, and say “amen”;"
18914,Use all the observance of civility
18915,Like one well studied in a sad ostent
18916,"To please his grandam, never trust me more."
18917,"Well, we shall see your bearing."
18918,"Nay, but I bar tonight, you shall not gauge me"
18919,By what we do tonight.
18920,"No, that were pity."
18921,I would entreat you rather to put on
18922,"Your boldest suit of mirth, for we have friends"
18923,"That purpose merriment. But fare you well,"
18924,I have some business.
18925,"And I must to Lorenzo and the rest,"
18926,But we will visit you at supper-time.
18927,SCENE III. The same. A room in Shylock’s house.
18928,Enter Jessica and Launcelet.
18929,I am sorry thou wilt leave my father so.
18930,"Our house is hell, and thou, a merry devil,"
18931,Didst rob it of some taste of tediousness.
18932,"But fare thee well, there is a ducat for thee,"
18933,"And, Launcelet, soon at supper shalt thou see"
18934,"Lorenzo, who is thy new master’s guest."
18935,"Give him this letter, do it secretly."
18936,And so farewell. I would not have my father
18937,See me in talk with thee.
18938,"Adieu! tears exhibit my tongue, most beautiful pagan, most sweet Jew!"
18939,"If a Christian do not play the knave and get thee, I am much deceived."
18940,"But, adieu! These foolish drops do something drown my manly spirit."
18941,"Alack, what heinous sin is it in me"
18942,To be ashamed to be my father’s child!
18943,"But though I am a daughter to his blood,"
18944,"I am not to his manners. O Lorenzo,"
18945,"If thou keep promise, I shall end this strife,"
18946,Become a Christian and thy loving wife.
18947,SCENE IV. The same. A street.
18948,"Enter Gratiano, Lorenzo, Salarino and Solanio."
18949,"Nay, we will slink away in supper-time,"
18950,"Disguise us at my lodging, and return"
18951,All in an hour.
18952,We have not made good preparation.
18953,We have not spoke us yet of torch-bearers.
18954,"’Tis vile, unless it may be quaintly order’d,"
18955,And better in my mind not undertook.
18956,"’Tis now but four o’clock, we have two hours"
18957,Enter Launcelet with a letter.
18958,"Friend Launcelet, what’s the news?"
18959,"And it shall please you to break up this, it shall seem to signify."
18960,"I know the hand, in faith ’tis a fair hand,"
18961,And whiter than the paper it writ on
18962,Is the fair hand that writ.
18963,"Love news, in faith."
18964,"By your leave, sir."
18965,"Marry, sir, to bid my old master the Jew to sup tonight with my new"
18966,"Hold here, take this. Tell gentle Jessica"
18967,"I will not fail her, speak it privately."
18968,Will you prepare you for this masque tonight?
18969,I am provided of a torch-bearer.
18970,"Ay, marry, I’ll be gone about it straight."
18971,And so will I.
18972,Meet me and Gratiano
18973,At Gratiano’s lodging some hour hence.
18974,’Tis good we do so.
18975,Was not that letter from fair Jessica?
18976,I must needs tell thee all. She hath directed
18977,"How I shall take her from her father’s house,"
18978,"What gold and jewels she is furnish’d with,"
18979,What page’s suit she hath in readiness.
18980,"If e’er the Jew her father come to heaven,"
18981,It will be for his gentle daughter’s sake;
18982,"And never dare misfortune cross her foot,"
18983,"Unless she do it under this excuse,"
18984,That she is issue to a faithless Jew.
18985,"Come, go with me, peruse this as thou goest;"
18986,Fair Jessica shall be my torch-bearer.
18987,SCENE V. The same. Before Shylock’s house.
18988,Enter Shylock the Jew and Launcelet his man that was the clown.
18989,"Well, thou shalt see, thy eyes shall be thy judge,"
18990,The difference of old Shylock and Bassanio.—
18991,"What, Jessica!—Thou shalt not gormandize"
18992,"As thou hast done with me;—What, Jessica!—"
18993,"And sleep, and snore, and rend apparel out."
18994,"Why, Jessica, I say!"
18995,Who bids thee call? I do not bid thee call.
18996,Your worship was wont to tell me I could do nothing without bidding.
18997,Call you? What is your will?
18998,"I am bid forth to supper, Jessica."
18999,There are my keys. But wherefore should I go?
19000,"I am not bid for love, they flatter me."
19001,"But yet I’ll go in hate, to feed upon"
19002,"The prodigal Christian. Jessica, my girl,"
19003,Look to my house. I am right loath to go;
19004,"There is some ill a-brewing towards my rest,"
19005,For I did dream of money-bags tonight.
19006,"I beseech you, sir, go. My young master doth expect your reproach."
19007,So do I his.
19008,And they have conspired together. I will not say you shall see a
19009,"masque, but if you do, then it was not for nothing that my nose fell"
19010,"a-bleeding on Black Monday last at six o’clock i’ th’ morning, falling"
19011,out that year on Ash-Wednesday was four year in th’ afternoon.
19012,"What, are there masques? Hear you me, Jessica,"
19013,"Lock up my doors, and when you hear the drum"
19014,"And the vile squealing of the wry-neck’d fife,"
19015,"Clamber not you up to the casements then,"
19016,Nor thrust your head into the public street
19017,"To gaze on Christian fools with varnish’d faces,"
19018,"But stop my house’s ears, I mean my casements."
19019,Let not the sound of shallow fopp’ry enter
19020,My sober house. By Jacob’s staff I swear
19021,I have no mind of feasting forth tonight.
19022,"But I will go. Go you before me, sirrah."
19023,Say I will come.
19024,"I will go before, sir."
19025,"Mistress, look out at window for all this."
19026,There will come a Christian by
19027,Will be worth a Jewess’ eye.
19028,"What says that fool of Hagar’s offspring, ha?"
19029,"His words were “Farewell, mistress,” nothing else."
19030,"The patch is kind enough, but a huge feeder,"
19031,"Snail-slow in profit, and he sleeps by day"
19032,"More than the wild-cat. Drones hive not with me,"
19033,"Therefore I part with him, and part with him"
19034,To one that I would have him help to waste
19035,"His borrowed purse. Well, Jessica, go in."
19036,Perhaps I will return immediately:
19037,"Do as I bid you, shut doors after you,"
19038,"“Fast bind, fast find.”"
19039,A proverb never stale in thrifty mind.
19040,"Farewell, and if my fortune be not crost,"
19041,"I have a father, you a daughter, lost."
19042,SCENE VI. The same.
19043,"Enter the masquers, Gratiano and Salarino."
19044,This is the penthouse under which Lorenzo
19045,Desired us to make stand.
19046,His hour is almost past.
19047,"And it is marvel he out-dwells his hour,"
19048,For lovers ever run before the clock.
19049,O ten times faster Venus’ pigeons fly
19050,To seal love’s bonds new-made than they are wont
19051,To keep obliged faith unforfeited!
19052,That ever holds: who riseth from a feast
19053,With that keen appetite that he sits down?
19054,Where is the horse that doth untread again
19055,His tedious measures with the unbated fire
19056,"That he did pace them first? All things that are,"
19057,Are with more spirit chased than enjoy’d.
19058,How like a younger or a prodigal
19059,"The scarfed bark puts from her native bay,"
19060,Hugg’d and embraced by the strumpet wind!
19061,How like the prodigal doth she return
19062,"With over-weather’d ribs and ragged sails,"
19063,"Lean, rent, and beggar’d by the strumpet wind!"
19064,"Here comes Lorenzo, more of this hereafter."
19065,"Sweet friends, your patience for my long abode."
19066,Not I but my affairs have made you wait.
19067,"When you shall please to play the thieves for wives,"
19068,I’ll watch as long for you then. Approach.
19069,Here dwells my father Jew. Ho! who’s within?
19070,"Enter Jessica above, in boy’s clothes."
19071,"Who are you? Tell me, for more certainty,"
19072,Albeit I’ll swear that I do know your tongue.
19073,"Lorenzo, and thy love."
19074,"Lorenzo certain, and my love indeed,"
19075,For who love I so much? And now who knows
19076,"But you, Lorenzo, whether I am yours?"
19077,Heaven and thy thoughts are witness that thou art.
19078,"Here, catch this casket; it is worth the pains."
19079,"I am glad ’tis night, you do not look on me,"
19080,For I am much asham’d of my exchange.
19081,"But love is blind, and lovers cannot see"
19082,"The pretty follies that themselves commit,"
19083,"For if they could, Cupid himself would blush"
19084,To see me thus transformed to a boy.
19085,"Descend, for you must be my torch-bearer."
19086,What! must I hold a candle to my shames?
19087,"They in themselves, good sooth, are too too light."
19088,"Why, ’tis an office of discovery, love,"
19089,And I should be obscur’d.
19090,"So are you, sweet,"
19091,Even in the lovely garnish of a boy.
19092,"But come at once,"
19093,"For the close night doth play the runaway,"
19094,And we are stay’d for at Bassanio’s feast.
19095,"I will make fast the doors, and gild myself"
19096,"With some moe ducats, and be with you straight."
19097,"Now, by my hood, a gentle, and no Jew."
19098,"Beshrew me but I love her heartily,"
19099,"For she is wise, if I can judge of her,"
19100,"And fair she is, if that mine eyes be true,"
19101,"And true she is, as she hath prov’d herself."
19102,"And therefore, like herself, wise, fair, and true,"
19103,Shall she be placed in my constant soul.
19104,"What, art thou come? On, gentlemen, away!"
19105,Our masquing mates by this time for us stay.
19106,"Fie, fie, Gratiano! where are all the rest?"
19107,"’Tis nine o’clock, our friends all stay for you."
19108,"No masque tonight, the wind is come about;"
19109,Bassanio presently will go aboard.
19110,I have sent twenty out to seek for you.
19111,I am glad on’t. I desire no more delight
19112,Than to be under sail and gone tonight.
19113,SCENE VII. Belmont. A room in Portia’s house.
19114,Flourish of cornets. Enter Portia with the Prince of Morocco and both
19115,"Go, draw aside the curtains and discover"
19116,The several caskets to this noble prince.
19117,Now make your choice.
19118,"The first, of gold, who this inscription bears,"
19119,“Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.”
19120,"The second, silver, which this promise carries,"
19121,“Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.”
19122,"This third, dull lead, with warning all as blunt,"
19123,“Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.”
19124,How shall I know if I do choose the right?
19125,"The one of them contains my picture, prince."
19126,"If you choose that, then I am yours withal."
19127,Some god direct my judgment! Let me see.
19128,I will survey the inscriptions back again.
19129,What says this leaden casket?
19130,“Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.”
19131,"Must give, for what? For lead? Hazard for lead!"
19132,This casket threatens; men that hazard all
19133,Do it in hope of fair advantages:
19134,"A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross,"
19135,I’ll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead.
19136,What says the silver with her virgin hue?
19137,“Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.”
19138,"As much as he deserves! Pause there, Morocco,"
19139,And weigh thy value with an even hand.
19140,If thou be’st rated by thy estimation
19141,"Thou dost deserve enough, and yet enough"
19142,May not extend so far as to the lady.
19143,And yet to be afeard of my deserving
19144,Were but a weak disabling of myself.
19145,"As much as I deserve! Why, that’s the lady:"
19146,"I do in birth deserve her, and in fortunes,"
19147,"In graces, and in qualities of breeding;"
19148,"But more than these, in love I do deserve."
19149,"What if I stray’d no farther, but chose here?"
19150,Let’s see once more this saying grav’d in gold:
19151,“Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.”
19152,"Why, that’s the lady, all the world desires her."
19153,From the four corners of the earth they come
19154,"To kiss this shrine, this mortal breathing saint."
19155,The Hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds
19156,Of wide Arabia are as throughfares now
19157,For princes to come view fair Portia.
19158,"The watery kingdom, whose ambitious head"
19159,"Spets in the face of heaven, is no bar"
19160,"To stop the foreign spirits, but they come"
19161,As o’er a brook to see fair Portia.
19162,One of these three contains her heavenly picture.
19163,Is’t like that lead contains her? ’Twere damnation
19164,To think so base a thought. It were too gross
19165,To rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave.
19166,Or shall I think in silver she’s immur’d
19167,Being ten times undervalued to tried gold?
19168,O sinful thought! Never so rich a gem
19169,Was set in worse than gold. They have in England
19170,A coin that bears the figure of an angel
19171,Stamped in gold; but that’s insculp’d upon;
19172,But here an angel in a golden bed
19173,Lies all within. Deliver me the key.
19174,"Here do I choose, and thrive I as I may."
19175,"There, take it, prince, and if my form lie there,"
19176,Then I am yours.
19177,O hell! what have we here?
19178,"A carrion Death, within whose empty eye"
19179,There is a written scroll. I’ll read the writing.
19180,"_All that glisters is not gold,"
19181,Often have you heard that told.
19182,Many a man his life hath sold
19183,But my outside to behold.
19184,Gilded tombs do worms infold.
19185,"Had you been as wise as bold,"
19186,"Young in limbs, in judgment old,"
19187,"Your answer had not been inscroll’d,"
19188,"Fare you well, your suit is cold._"
19189,"Cold indeed and labour lost,"
19190,"Then farewell heat, and welcome frost."
19191,"Portia, adieu! I have too griev’d a heart"
19192,To take a tedious leave. Thus losers part.
19193,"A gentle riddance. Draw the curtains, go."
19194,Let all of his complexion choose me so.
19195,SCENE VIII. Venice. A street.
19196,Enter Salarino and Solanio.
19197,"Why, man, I saw Bassanio under sail;"
19198,With him is Gratiano gone along;
19199,And in their ship I am sure Lorenzo is not.
19200,"The villain Jew with outcries rais’d the Duke,"
19201,Who went with him to search Bassanio’s ship.
19202,"He came too late, the ship was under sail;"
19203,But there the Duke was given to understand
19204,That in a gondola were seen together
19205,Lorenzo and his amorous Jessica.
19206,"Besides, Antonio certified the Duke"
19207,They were not with Bassanio in his ship.
19208,"I never heard a passion so confus’d,"
19209,"So strange, outrageous, and so variable"
19210,As the dog Jew did utter in the streets.
19211,“My daughter! O my ducats! O my daughter!
19212,Fled with a Christian! O my Christian ducats!
19213,Justice! the law! my ducats and my daughter!
19214,"A sealed bag, two sealed bags of ducats,"
19215,"Of double ducats, stol’n from me by my daughter!"
19216,"And jewels, two stones, two rich and precious stones,"
19217,"Stol’n by my daughter! Justice! find the girl,"
19218,She hath the stones upon her and the ducats.”
19219,"Why, all the boys in Venice follow him,"
19220,"Crying, his stones, his daughter, and his ducats."
19221,Let good Antonio look he keep his day
19222,Or he shall pay for this.
19223,"I reason’d with a Frenchman yesterday,"
19224,"Who told me, in the narrow seas that part"
19225,"The French and English, there miscarried"
19226,A vessel of our country richly fraught.
19227,"I thought upon Antonio when he told me,"
19228,And wish’d in silence that it were not his.
19229,"You were best to tell Antonio what you hear,"
19230,"Yet do not suddenly, for it may grieve him."
19231,A kinder gentleman treads not the earth.
19232,"I saw Bassanio and Antonio part,"
19233,Bassanio told him he would make some speed
19234,"Of his return. He answered “Do not so,"
19235,"Slubber not business for my sake, Bassanio,"
19236,"But stay the very riping of the time,"
19237,"And for the Jew’s bond which he hath of me,"
19238,Let it not enter in your mind of love:
19239,"Be merry, and employ your chiefest thoughts"
19240,"To courtship, and such fair ostents of love"
19241,As shall conveniently become you there.”
19242,"And even there, his eye being big with tears,"
19243,"Turning his face, he put his hand behind him,"
19244,And with affection wondrous sensible
19245,"He wrung Bassanio’s hand, and so they parted."
19246,I think he only loves the world for him.
19247,"I pray thee, let us go and find him out"
19248,And quicken his embraced heaviness
19249,With some delight or other.
19250,SCENE IX. Belmont. A room in Portia’s house.
19251,Enter Nerissa and a Servitor.
19252,"Quick, quick, I pray thee, draw the curtain straight."
19253,"The Prince of Arragon hath ta’en his oath,"
19254,And comes to his election presently.
19255,"Flourish of cornets. Enter the Prince of Arragon, his train, and"
19256,"Behold, there stand the caskets, noble Prince,"
19257,"If you choose that wherein I am contain’d,"
19258,Straight shall our nuptial rites be solemniz’d.
19259,"But if you fail, without more speech, my lord,"
19260,You must be gone from hence immediately.
19261,I am enjoin’d by oath to observe three things:
19262,"First, never to unfold to anyone"
19263,"Which casket ’twas I chose; next, if I fail"
19264,"Of the right casket, never in my life"
19265,To woo a maid in way of marriage;
19266,"If I do fail in fortune of my choice,"
19267,Immediately to leave you and be gone.
19268,To these injunctions everyone doth swear
19269,That comes to hazard for my worthless self.
19270,And so have I address’d me. Fortune now
19271,"To my heart’s hope! Gold, silver, and base lead."
19272,“Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.”
19273,You shall look fairer ere I give or hazard.
19274,What says the golden chest? Ha! let me see:
19275,“Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.”
19276,What many men desire! that “many” may be meant
19277,"By the fool multitude, that choose by show,"
19278,"Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach,"
19279,"Which pries not to th’ interior, but like the martlet"
19280,"Builds in the weather on the outward wall,"
19281,Even in the force and road of casualty.
19282,"I will not choose what many men desire,"
19283,Because I will not jump with common spirits
19284,And rank me with the barbarous multitudes.
19285,"Why, then to thee, thou silver treasure-house,"
19286,Tell me once more what title thou dost bear.
19287,“Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.”
19288,And well said too; for who shall go about
19289,"To cozen fortune, and be honourable"
19290,Without the stamp of merit? Let none presume
19291,To wear an undeserved dignity.
19292,"O that estates, degrees, and offices"
19293,"Were not deriv’d corruptly, and that clear honour"
19294,Were purchas’d by the merit of the wearer!
19295,How many then should cover that stand bare?
19296,How many be commanded that command?
19297,How much low peasantry would then be gleaned
19298,From the true seed of honour? And how much honour
19299,"Pick’d from the chaff and ruin of the times,"
19300,"To be new varnish’d? Well, but to my choice."
19301,“Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.”
19302,"I will assume desert. Give me a key for this,"
19303,And instantly unlock my fortunes here.
19304,Too long a pause for that which you find there.
19305,What’s here? The portrait of a blinking idiot
19306,Presenting me a schedule! I will read it.
19307,How much unlike art thou to Portia!
19308,How much unlike my hopes and my deservings!
19309,“Who chooseth me shall have as much as he deserves.”
19310,Did I deserve no more than a fool’s head?
19311,Is that my prize? Are my deserts no better?
19312,"To offend and judge are distinct offices,"
19313,And of opposed natures.
19314,_The fire seven times tried this;
19315,Seven times tried that judgment is
19316,That did never choose amiss.
19317,Some there be that shadows kiss;
19318,Such have but a shadow’s bliss.
19319,"There be fools alive, I wis,"
19320,"Silver’d o’er, and so was this."
19321,"Take what wife you will to bed,"
19322,I will ever be your head:
19323,So be gone; you are sped._
19324,Still more fool I shall appear
19325,By the time I linger here.
19326,"With one fool’s head I came to woo,"
19327,But I go away with two.
19328,"Sweet, adieu! I’ll keep my oath,"
19329,Patiently to bear my wroth.
19330,Thus hath the candle sing’d the moth.
19331,"O, these deliberate fools! When they do choose,"
19332,They have the wisdom by their wit to lose.
19333,The ancient saying is no heresy:
19334,Hanging and wiving goes by destiny.
19335,"Come, draw the curtain, Nerissa."
19336,Where is my lady?
19337,Here. What would my lord?
19338,"Madam, there is alighted at your gate"
19339,"A young Venetian, one that comes before"
19340,"To signify th’ approaching of his lord,"
19341,From whom he bringeth sensible regreets;
19342,To wit (besides commends and courteous breath)
19343,Gifts of rich value; yet I have not seen
19344,So likely an ambassador of love.
19345,"A day in April never came so sweet,"
19346,"To show how costly summer was at hand,"
19347,As this fore-spurrer comes before his lord.
19348,"No more, I pray thee. I am half afeard"
19349,"Thou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee,"
19350,Thou spend’st such high-day wit in praising him.
19351,"Come, come, Nerissa, for I long to see"
19352,Quick Cupid’s post that comes so mannerly.
19353,"Bassanio, Lord Love, if thy will it be!"
19354,SCENE I. Venice. A street.
19355,Enter Solanio and Salarino.
19356,"Now, what news on the Rialto?"
19357,"Why, yet it lives there unchecked that Antonio hath a ship of rich"
19358,"lading wrack’d on the narrow seas; the Goodwins, I think they call the"
19359,"place, a very dangerous flat and fatal, where the carcasses of many a"
19360,"tall ship lie buried, as they say, if my gossip Report be an honest"
19361,woman of her word.
19362,I would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever knapped ginger or
19363,made her neighbours believe she wept for the death of a third husband.
19364,"But it is true, without any slips of prolixity or crossing the plain"
19365,"highway of talk, that the good Antonio, the honest Antonio,—O that I"
19366,had a title good enough to keep his name company!—
19367,"Come, the full stop."
19368,"Ha, what sayest thou? Why, the end is, he hath lost a ship."
19369,I would it might prove the end of his losses.
19370,"Let me say “amen” betimes, lest the devil cross my prayer, for here he"
19371,comes in the likeness of a Jew.
19372,"How now, Shylock, what news among the merchants?"
19373,"You knew, none so well, none so well as you, of my daughter’s flight."
19374,"That’s certain, I, for my part, knew the tailor that made the wings she"
19375,"And Shylock, for his own part, knew the bird was fledged; and then it"
19376,is the complexion of them all to leave the dam.
19377,She is damn’d for it.
19378,"That’s certain, if the devil may be her judge."
19379,My own flesh and blood to rebel!
19380,"Out upon it, old carrion! Rebels it at these years?"
19381,I say my daughter is my flesh and my blood.
19382,There is more difference between thy flesh and hers than between jet
19383,"and ivory, more between your bloods than there is between red wine and"
19384,"Rhenish. But tell us, do you hear whether Antonio have had any loss at"
19385,"There I have another bad match, a bankrupt, a prodigal, who dare scarce"
19386,"show his head on the Rialto, a beggar that used to come so smug upon"
19387,the mart; let him look to his bond. He was wont to call me usurer; let
19388,him look to his bond: he was wont to lend money for a Christian cur’sy;
19389,let him look to his bond.
19390,"Why, I am sure if he forfeit, thou wilt not take his flesh! What’s that"
19391,"To bait fish withal; if it will feed nothing else, it will feed my"
19392,"revenge. He hath disgrac’d me and hind’red me half a million, laugh’d"
19393,"at my losses, mock’d at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted my"
19394,"bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine enemies. And what’s his"
19395,"reason? I am a Jew. Hath not a Jew eyes? Hath not a Jew hands, organs,"
19396,"dimensions, senses, affections, passions? Fed with the same food, hurt"
19397,"with the same weapons, subject to the same diseases, healed by the same"
19398,"means, warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer as a Christian"
19399,"is? If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not"
19400,"laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we"
19401,"not revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will resemble you in"
19402,"that. If a Jew wrong a Christian, what is his humility? Revenge. If a"
19403,"Christian wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by Christian"
19404,"example? Why, revenge! The villainy you teach me I will execute, and it"
19405,shall go hard but I will better the instruction.
19406,Enter a man from Antonio.
19407,"Gentlemen, my master Antonio is at his house, and desires to speak with"
19408,We have been up and down to seek him.
19409,"Here comes another of the tribe; a third cannot be match’d, unless the"
19410,devil himself turn Jew.
19411,"How now, Tubal, what news from Genoa? Hast thou found my daughter?"
19412,"I often came where I did hear of her, but cannot find her."
19413,"Why there, there, there, there! A diamond gone cost me two thousand"
19414,"ducats in Frankfort! The curse never fell upon our nation till now, I"
19415,"never felt it till now. Two thousand ducats in that, and other"
19416,"precious, precious jewels. I would my daughter were dead at my foot,"
19417,"and the jewels in her ear; would she were hearsed at my foot, and the"
19418,ducats in her coffin. No news of them? Why so? And I know not what’s
19419,"spent in the search. Why, thou—loss upon loss! The thief gone with so"
19420,"much, and so much to find the thief, and no satisfaction, no revenge,"
19421,"nor no ill luck stirring but what lights o’ my shoulders, no sighs but"
19422,"o’ my breathing, no tears but o’ my shedding."
19423,"Yes, other men have ill luck too. Antonio, as I heard in Genoa—"
19424,"What, what, what? Ill luck, ill luck?"
19425,—hath an argosy cast away coming from Tripolis.
19426,"I thank God! I thank God! Is it true, is it true?"
19427,I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wrack.
19428,"I thank thee, good Tubal. Good news, good news! Ha, ha, heard in Genoa?"
19429,"Your daughter spent in Genoa, as I heard, one night, fourscore ducats."
19430,Thou stick’st a dagger in me. I shall never see my gold again.
19431,Fourscore ducats at a sitting! Fourscore ducats!
19432,There came divers of Antonio’s creditors in my company to Venice that
19433,swear he cannot choose but break.
19434,"I am very glad of it. I’ll plague him, I’ll torture him. I am glad of"
19435,One of them showed me a ring that he had of your daughter for a monkey.
19436,"Out upon her! Thou torturest me, Tubal. It was my turquoise, I had it"
19437,of Leah when I was a bachelor. I would not have given it for a
19438,But Antonio is certainly undone.
19439,"Nay, that’s true, that’s very true. Go, Tubal, fee me an officer;"
19440,bespeak him a fortnight before. I will have the heart of him if he
19441,"forfeit, for were he out of Venice I can make what merchandise I will."
19442,"Go, Tubal, and meet me at our synagogue. Go, good Tubal, at our"
19443,SCENE II. Belmont. A room in Portia’s house.
19444,"Enter Bassanio, Portia, Gratiano, Nerissa and all their trains."
19445,"I pray you tarry, pause a day or two"
19446,"Before you hazard, for in choosing wrong"
19447,I lose your company; therefore forbear a while.
19448,There’s something tells me (but it is not love)
19449,"I would not lose you, and you know yourself"
19450,Hate counsels not in such a quality.
19451,"But lest you should not understand me well,—"
19452,"And yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought,—"
19453,I would detain you here some month or two
19454,Before you venture for me. I could teach you
19455,"How to choose right, but then I am forsworn."
19456,So will I never be. So may you miss me.
19457,"But if you do, you’ll make me wish a sin,"
19458,"That I had been forsworn. Beshrew your eyes,"
19459,They have o’erlook’d me and divided me.
19460,"One half of me is yours, the other half yours,"
19461,"Mine own, I would say; but if mine, then yours,"
19462,And so all yours. O these naughty times
19463,Puts bars between the owners and their rights!
19464,"And so though yours, not yours. Prove it so,"
19465,"Let Fortune go to hell for it, not I."
19466,"I speak too long, but ’tis to peise the time,"
19467,"To eche it, and to draw it out in length,"
19468,To stay you from election.
19469,"For as I am, I live upon the rack."
19470,"Upon the rack, Bassanio! Then confess"
19471,What treason there is mingled with your love.
19472,"None but that ugly treason of mistrust,"
19473,Which makes me fear th’ enjoying of my love.
19474,There may as well be amity and life
19475,’Tween snow and fire as treason and my love.
19476,"Ay, but I fear you speak upon the rack"
19477,Where men enforced do speak anything.
19478,"Promise me life, and I’ll confess the truth."
19479,"Well then, confess and live."
19480,Had been the very sum of my confession:
19481,"O happy torment, when my torturer"
19482,Doth teach me answers for deliverance!
19483,But let me to my fortune and the caskets.
19484,"Away, then! I am lock’d in one of them."
19485,"If you do love me, you will find me out."
19486,"Nerissa and the rest, stand all aloof."
19487,Let music sound while he doth make his choice.
19488,"Then if he lose he makes a swan-like end,"
19489,Fading in music. That the comparison
19490,"May stand more proper, my eye shall be the stream"
19491,"And wat’ry death-bed for him. He may win,"
19492,And what is music then? Then music is
19493,Even as the flourish when true subjects bow
19494,To a new-crowned monarch. Such it is
19495,As are those dulcet sounds in break of day
19496,That creep into the dreaming bridegroom’s ear
19497,"And summon him to marriage. Now he goes,"
19498,"With no less presence, but with much more love"
19499,Than young Alcides when he did redeem
19500,The virgin tribute paid by howling Troy
19501,To the sea-monster: I stand for sacrifice;
19502,"The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives,"
19503,With bleared visages come forth to view
19504,"The issue of th’ exploit. Go, Hercules!"
19505,"Live thou, I live. With much much more dismay"
19506,I view the fight than thou that mak’st the fray.
19507,"A song, whilst Bassanio comments on the caskets to himself."
19508,"_Tell me where is fancy bred,"
19509,Or in the heart or in the head?
19510,"How begot, how nourished?"
19511,"It is engend’red in the eyes,"
19512,"With gazing fed, and fancy dies"
19513,In the cradle where it lies.
19514,Let us all ring fancy’s knell:
19515,"I’ll begin it.—Ding, dong, bell._"
19516,So may the outward shows be least themselves.
19517,The world is still deceiv’d with ornament.
19518,"In law, what plea so tainted and corrupt"
19519,"But, being season’d with a gracious voice,"
19520,"Obscures the show of evil? In religion,"
19521,What damned error but some sober brow
19522,"Will bless it, and approve it with a text,"
19523,Hiding the grossness with fair ornament?
19524,There is no vice so simple but assumes
19525,Some mark of virtue on his outward parts.
19526,"How many cowards, whose hearts are all as false"
19527,"As stairs of sand, wear yet upon their chins"
19528,"The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars,"
19529,"Who inward search’d, have livers white as milk,"
19530,And these assume but valour’s excrement
19531,"To render them redoubted. Look on beauty,"
19532,"And you shall see ’tis purchas’d by the weight,"
19533,"Which therein works a miracle in nature,"
19534,Making them lightest that wear most of it:
19535,So are those crisped snaky golden locks
19536,Which make such wanton gambols with the wind
19537,"Upon supposed fairness, often known"
19538,"To be the dowry of a second head,"
19539,The skull that bred them in the sepulchre.
19540,Thus ornament is but the guiled shore
19541,To a most dangerous sea; the beauteous scarf
19542,"Veiling an Indian beauty; in a word,"
19543,The seeming truth which cunning times put on
19544,"To entrap the wisest. Therefore thou gaudy gold,"
19545,"Hard food for Midas, I will none of thee,"
19546,"Nor none of thee, thou pale and common drudge"
19547,"’Tween man and man: but thou, thou meagre lead,"
19548,"Which rather threaten’st than dost promise aught,"
19549,"Thy palenness moves me more than eloquence,"
19550,"And here choose I, joy be the consequence!"
19551,"As doubtful thoughts, and rash-embrac’d despair,"
19552,"And shudd’ring fear, and green-ey’d jealousy."
19553,"O love, be moderate; allay thy ecstasy,"
19554,In measure rain thy joy; scant this excess!
19555,"I feel too much thy blessing, make it less,"
19556,For fear I surfeit.
19557,What find I here? [_Opening the leaden casket_.]
19558,Fair Portia’s counterfeit! What demi-god
19559,Hath come so near creation? Move these eyes?
19560,"Or whether, riding on the balls of mine,"
19561,"Seem they in motion? Here are sever’d lips,"
19562,"Parted with sugar breath, so sweet a bar"
19563,Should sunder such sweet friends. Here in her hairs
19564,"The painter plays the spider, and hath woven"
19565,A golden mesh t’entrap the hearts of men
19566,Faster than gnats in cobwebs. But her eyes!—
19567,"How could he see to do them? Having made one,"
19568,Methinks it should have power to steal both his
19569,And leave itself unfurnish’d. Yet look how far
19570,The substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow
19571,"In underprizing it, so far this shadow"
19572,"Doth limp behind the substance. Here’s the scroll,"
19573,The continent and summary of my fortune.
19574,_You that choose not by the view
19575,Chance as fair and choose as true!
19576,"Since this fortune falls to you,"
19577,Be content and seek no new.
19578,"If you be well pleas’d with this,"
19579,"And hold your fortune for your bliss,"
19580,"Turn to where your lady is,"
19581,And claim her with a loving kiss._
19582,"A gentle scroll. Fair lady, by your leave, [_Kissing her_.]"
19583,I come by note to give and to receive.
19584,Like one of two contending in a prize
19585,"That thinks he hath done well in people’s eyes,"
19586,"Hearing applause and universal shout,"
19587,"Giddy in spirit, still gazing in a doubt"
19588,"Whether those peals of praise be his or no,"
19589,"So, thrice-fair lady, stand I even so,"
19590,"As doubtful whether what I see be true,"
19591,"Until confirm’d, sign’d, ratified by you."
19592,"You see me, Lord Bassanio, where I stand,"
19593,Such as I am; though for myself alone
19594,I would not be ambitious in my wish
19595,"To wish myself much better, yet for you"
19596,"I would be trebled twenty times myself,"
19597,"A thousand times more fair, ten thousand times"
19598,"That only to stand high in your account,"
19599,"I might in virtues, beauties, livings, friends,"
19600,Exceed account. But the full sum of me
19601,"Is sum of something, which, to term in gross,"
19602,"Is an unlesson’d girl, unschool’d, unpractis’d;"
19603,"Happy in this, she is not yet so old"
19604,"But she may learn; happier than this,"
19605,She is not bred so dull but she can learn;
19606,"Happiest of all, is that her gentle spirit"
19607,"Commits itself to yours to be directed,"
19608,"As from her lord, her governor, her king."
19609,"Myself, and what is mine, to you and yours"
19610,Is now converted. But now I was the lord
19611,"Of this fair mansion, master of my servants,"
19612,"Queen o’er myself; and even now, but now,"
19613,"This house, these servants, and this same myself"
19614,"Are yours,—my lord’s. I give them with this ring,"
19615,"Which when you part from, lose, or give away,"
19616,"Let it presage the ruin of your love,"
19617,And be my vantage to exclaim on you.
19618,"Madam, you have bereft me of all words,"
19619,"Only my blood speaks to you in my veins,"
19620,And there is such confusion in my powers
19621,As after some oration fairly spoke
19622,"By a beloved prince, there doth appear"
19623,"Among the buzzing pleased multitude,"
19624,"Where every something being blent together,"
19625,"Turns to a wild of nothing, save of joy"
19626,Express’d and not express’d. But when this ring
19627,"Parts from this finger, then parts life from hence."
19628,O then be bold to say Bassanio’s dead!
19629,"My lord and lady, it is now our time,"
19630,"That have stood by and seen our wishes prosper,"
19631,"To cry, good joy. Good joy, my lord and lady!"
19632,"My Lord Bassanio, and my gentle lady,"
19633,I wish you all the joy that you can wish;
19634,For I am sure you can wish none from me.
19635,And when your honours mean to solemnize
19636,"The bargain of your faith, I do beseech you"
19637,Even at that time I may be married too.
19638,"With all my heart, so thou canst get a wife."
19639,"I thank your lordship, you have got me one."
19640,"My eyes, my lord, can look as swift as yours:"
19641,"You saw the mistress, I beheld the maid."
19642,"You lov’d, I lov’d; for intermission"
19643,"No more pertains to me, my lord, than you."
19644,"Your fortune stood upon the caskets there,"
19645,"And so did mine too, as the matter falls."
19646,"For wooing here until I sweat again,"
19647,And swearing till my very roof was dry
19648,"With oaths of love, at last, (if promise last)"
19649,I got a promise of this fair one here
19650,"To have her love, provided that your fortune"
19651,"Is this true, Nerissa?"
19652,"Madam, it is, so you stand pleas’d withal."
19653,"And do you, Gratiano, mean good faith?"
19654,"Yes, faith, my lord."
19655,Our feast shall be much honoured in your marriage.
19656,We’ll play with them the first boy for a thousand ducats.
19657,What! and stake down?
19658,"No, we shall ne’er win at that sport and stake down."
19659,But who comes here? Lorenzo and his infidel?
19660,"What, and my old Venetian friend, Salerio!"
19661,"Enter Lorenzo, Jessica and Salerio."
19662,"Lorenzo and Salerio, welcome hither,"
19663,If that the youth of my new int’rest here
19664,"Have power to bid you welcome. By your leave,"
19665,"I bid my very friends and countrymen,"
19666,"So do I, my lord,"
19667,They are entirely welcome.
19668,"I thank your honour. For my part, my lord,"
19669,"My purpose was not to have seen you here,"
19670,"But meeting with Salerio by the way,"
19671,"He did entreat me, past all saying nay,"
19672,To come with him along.
19673,"I did, my lord,"
19674,And I have reason for it. Signior Antonio
19675,Commends him to you.
19676,"Ere I ope his letter,"
19677,I pray you tell me how my good friend doth.
19678,"Not sick, my lord, unless it be in mind,"
19679,"Nor well, unless in mind. His letter there"
19680,Will show you his estate.
19681,"Nerissa, cheer yond stranger, bid her welcome."
19682,"Your hand, Salerio. What’s the news from Venice?"
19683,"How doth that royal merchant, good Antonio?"
19684,I know he will be glad of our success.
19685,"We are the Jasons, we have won the fleece."
19686,I would you had won the fleece that he hath lost.
19687,There are some shrewd contents in yond same paper
19688,That steals the colour from Bassanio’s cheek.
19689,"Some dear friend dead, else nothing in the world"
19690,Could turn so much the constitution
19691,"Of any constant man. What, worse and worse?"
19692,"With leave, Bassanio, I am half yourself,"
19693,And I must freely have the half of anything
19694,That this same paper brings you.
19695,Here are a few of the unpleasant’st words
19696,"That ever blotted paper. Gentle lady,"
19697,"When I did first impart my love to you,"
19698,I freely told you all the wealth I had
19699,"Ran in my veins, I was a gentleman."
19700,"And then I told you true. And yet, dear lady,"
19701,"Rating myself at nothing, you shall see"
19702,How much I was a braggart. When I told you
19703,"My state was nothing, I should then have told you"
19704,That I was worse than nothing; for indeed
19705,"I have engag’d myself to a dear friend,"
19706,"Engag’d my friend to his mere enemy,"
19707,"To feed my means. Here is a letter, lady,"
19708,"The paper as the body of my friend,"
19709,And every word in it a gaping wound
19710,"Issuing life-blood. But is it true, Salerio?"
19711,"Hath all his ventures fail’d? What, not one hit?"
19712,"From Tripolis, from Mexico, and England,"
19713,"From Lisbon, Barbary, and India,"
19714,And not one vessel scape the dreadful touch
19715,"Not one, my lord."
19716,"Besides, it should appear, that if he had"
19717,"The present money to discharge the Jew,"
19718,He would not take it. Never did I know
19719,A creature that did bear the shape of man
19720,So keen and greedy to confound a man.
19721,"He plies the Duke at morning and at night,"
19722,And doth impeach the freedom of the state
19723,"If they deny him justice. Twenty merchants,"
19724,"The Duke himself, and the magnificoes"
19725,"Of greatest port have all persuaded with him,"
19726,But none can drive him from the envious plea
19727,"Of forfeiture, of justice, and his bond."
19728,"When I was with him, I have heard him swear"
19729,"To Tubal and to Chus, his countrymen,"
19730,That he would rather have Antonio’s flesh
19731,Than twenty times the value of the sum
19732,"That he did owe him. And I know, my lord,"
19733,"If law, authority, and power deny not,"
19734,It will go hard with poor Antonio.
19735,Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble?
19736,"The dearest friend to me, the kindest man,"
19737,The best condition’d and unwearied spirit
19738,"In doing courtesies, and one in whom"
19739,The ancient Roman honour more appears
19740,Than any that draws breath in Italy.
19741,What sum owes he the Jew?
19742,For me three thousand ducats.
19743,"Pay him six thousand, and deface the bond."
19744,"Double six thousand, and then treble that,"
19745,Before a friend of this description
19746,Shall lose a hair through Bassanio’s fault.
19747,"First go with me to church and call me wife,"
19748,And then away to Venice to your friend.
19749,For never shall you lie by Portia’s side
19750,With an unquiet soul. You shall have gold
19751,To pay the petty debt twenty times over.
19752,"When it is paid, bring your true friend along."
19753,"My maid Nerissa and myself meantime,"
19754,"Will live as maids and widows. Come, away!"
19755,For you shall hence upon your wedding day.
19756,"Bid your friends welcome, show a merry cheer;"
19757,"Since you are dear bought, I will love you dear."
19758,But let me hear the letter of your friend.
19759,"_Sweet Bassanio, my ships have all miscarried, my creditors grow cruel,"
19760,"my estate is very low, my bond to the Jew is forfeit, and since in"
19761,"paying it, it is impossible I should live, all debts are clear’d"
19762,"between you and I, if I might but see you at my death. Notwithstanding,"
19763,"use your pleasure. If your love do not persuade you to come, let not my"
19764,"O love, dispatch all business and be gone!"
19765,"Since I have your good leave to go away,"
19766,"I will make haste; but, till I come again,"
19767,"No bed shall e’er be guilty of my stay,"
19768,Nor rest be interposer ’twixt us twain.
19769,SCENE III. Venice. A street.
19770,"Enter Shylock, Salarino, Antonio and Gaoler."
19771,"Gaoler, look to him. Tell not me of mercy."
19772,This is the fool that lent out money gratis.
19773,"Gaoler, look to him."
19774,"Hear me yet, good Shylock."
19775,"I’ll have my bond, speak not against my bond."
19776,I have sworn an oath that I will have my bond.
19777,"Thou call’dst me dog before thou hadst a cause,"
19778,"But since I am a dog, beware my fangs;"
19779,"The Duke shall grant me justice. I do wonder,"
19780,"Thou naughty gaoler, that thou art so fond"
19781,To come abroad with him at his request.
19782,I pray thee hear me speak.
19783,I’ll have my bond. I will not hear thee speak.
19784,"I’ll have my bond, and therefore speak no more."
19785,"I’ll not be made a soft and dull-eyed fool,"
19786,"To shake the head, relent, and sigh, and yield"
19787,"To Christian intercessors. Follow not,"
19788,"I’ll have no speaking, I will have my bond."
19789,It is the most impenetrable cur
19790,That ever kept with men.
19791,I’ll follow him no more with bootless prayers.
19792,"He seeks my life, his reason well I know:"
19793,I oft deliver’d from his forfeitures
19794,Many that have at times made moan to me.
19795,Therefore he hates me.
19796,I am sure the Duke
19797,Will never grant this forfeiture to hold.
19798,"The Duke cannot deny the course of law,"
19799,For the commodity that strangers have
19800,"With us in Venice, if it be denied,"
19801,"’Twill much impeach the justice of the state,"
19802,Since that the trade and profit of the city
19803,"Consisteth of all nations. Therefore, go."
19804,These griefs and losses have so bated me
19805,That I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh
19806,Tomorrow to my bloody creditor.
19807,"Well, gaoler, on, pray God Bassanio come"
19808,"To see me pay his debt, and then I care not."
19809,SCENE IV. Belmont. A room in Portia’s house.
19810,"Enter Portia, Nerissa, Lorenzo, Jessica and Balthazar."
19811,"Madam, although I speak it in your presence,"
19812,You have a noble and a true conceit
19813,"Of godlike amity, which appears most strongly"
19814,In bearing thus the absence of your lord.
19815,"But if you knew to whom you show this honour,"
19816,"How true a gentleman you send relief,"
19817,"How dear a lover of my lord your husband,"
19818,I know you would be prouder of the work
19819,Than customary bounty can enforce you.
19820,"I never did repent for doing good,"
19821,Nor shall not now; for in companions
19822,"That do converse and waste the time together,"
19823,"Whose souls do bear an equal yoke of love,"
19824,There must be needs a like proportion
19825,"Of lineaments, of manners, and of spirit;"
19826,"Which makes me think that this Antonio,"
19827,"Being the bosom lover of my lord,"
19828,"Must needs be like my lord. If it be so,"
19829,How little is the cost I have bestowed
19830,In purchasing the semblance of my soul
19831,From out the state of hellish cruelty!
19832,This comes too near the praising of myself;
19833,Therefore no more of it. Hear other things.
19834,"Lorenzo, I commit into your hands"
19835,The husbandry and manage of my house
19836,"Until my lord’s return. For mine own part,"
19837,I have toward heaven breath’d a secret vow
19838,"To live in prayer and contemplation,"
19839,"Only attended by Nerissa here,"
19840,Until her husband and my lord’s return.
19841,"There is a monastery two miles off,"
19842,And there we will abide. I do desire you
19843,"Not to deny this imposition,"
19844,The which my love and some necessity
19845,Now lays upon you.
19846,"Madam, with all my heart"
19847,I shall obey you in all fair commands.
19848,"My people do already know my mind,"
19849,And will acknowledge you and Jessica
19850,In place of Lord Bassanio and myself.
19851,So fare you well till we shall meet again.
19852,Fair thoughts and happy hours attend on you!
19853,I wish your ladyship all heart’s content.
19854,"I thank you for your wish, and am well pleas’d"
19855,"To wish it back on you. Fare you well, Jessica."
19856,"As I have ever found thee honest-true,"
19857,"So let me find thee still. Take this same letter,"
19858,And use thou all th’ endeavour of a man
19859,"In speed to Padua, see thou render this"
19860,"Into my cousin’s hands, Doctor Bellario;"
19861,"And look what notes and garments he doth give thee,"
19862,"Bring them, I pray thee, with imagin’d speed"
19863,"Unto the traject, to the common ferry"
19864,"Which trades to Venice. Waste no time in words,"
19865,But get thee gone. I shall be there before thee.
19866,"Madam, I go with all convenient speed."
19867,"Come on, Nerissa, I have work in hand"
19868,That you yet know not of; we’ll see our husbands
19869,Before they think of us.
19870,Shall they see us?
19871,"They shall, Nerissa, but in such a habit"
19872,That they shall think we are accomplished
19873,"With that we lack. I’ll hold thee any wager,"
19874,"When we are both accoutered like young men,"
19875,"I’ll prove the prettier fellow of the two,"
19876,"And wear my dagger with the braver grace,"
19877,And speak between the change of man and boy
19878,With a reed voice; and turn two mincing steps
19879,Into a manly stride; and speak of frays
19880,Like a fine bragging youth; and tell quaint lies
19881,"How honourable ladies sought my love,"
19882,"Which I denying, they fell sick and died;"
19883,"I could not do withal. Then I’ll repent,"
19884,"And wish for all that, that I had not kill’d them."
19885,"And twenty of these puny lies I’ll tell,"
19886,That men shall swear I have discontinued school
19887,About a twelvemonth. I have within my mind
19888,"A thousand raw tricks of these bragging Jacks,"
19889,Which I will practise.
19890,"Why, shall we turn to men?"
19891,"Fie, what a question’s that,"
19892,If thou wert near a lewd interpreter!
19893,"But come, I’ll tell thee all my whole device"
19894,"When I am in my coach, which stays for us"
19895,"At the park gate; and therefore haste away,"
19896,For we must measure twenty miles today.
19897,SCENE V. The same. A garden.
19898,Enter Launcelet and Jessica.
19899,"Yes, truly, for look you, the sins of the father are to be laid upon"
19900,"the children, therefore, I promise you, I fear you. I was always plain"
19901,"with you, and so now I speak my agitation of the matter. Therefore be"
19902,"of good cheer, for truly I think you are damn’d. There is but one hope"
19903,"in it that can do you any good, and that is but a kind of bastard hope"
19904,"And what hope is that, I pray thee?"
19905,"Marry, you may partly hope that your father got you not, that you are"
19906,not the Jew’s daughter.
19907,That were a kind of bastard hope indeed; so the sins of my mother
19908,should be visited upon me.
19909,Truly then I fear you are damn’d both by father and mother; thus when I
19910,"shun Scylla your father, I fall into Charybdis your mother. Well, you"
19911,are gone both ways.
19912,I shall be saved by my husband. He hath made me a Christian.
19913,"Truly the more to blame he, we were Christians enow before, e’en as"
19914,many as could well live one by another. This making of Christians will
19915,"raise the price of hogs; if we grow all to be pork-eaters, we shall not"
19916,shortly have a rasher on the coals for money.
19917,"I’ll tell my husband, Launcelet, what you say. Here he comes."
19918,"I shall grow jealous of you shortly, Launcelet, if you thus get my wife"
19919,"Nay, you need not fear us, Lorenzo. Launcelet and I are out. He tells"
19920,"me flatly there’s no mercy for me in heaven, because I am a Jew’s"
19921,"daughter; and he says you are no good member of the commonwealth, for"
19922,in converting Jews to Christians you raise the price of pork.
19923,I shall answer that better to the commonwealth than you can the getting
19924,"up of the negro’s belly! The Moor is with child by you, Launcelet."
19925,It is much that the Moor should be more than reason; but if she be less
19926,"than an honest woman, she is indeed more than I took her for."
19927,How every fool can play upon the word! I think the best grace of wit
19928,"will shortly turn into silence, and discourse grow commendable in none"
19929,"only but parrots. Go in, sirrah; bid them prepare for dinner."
19930,"That is done, sir, they have all stomachs."
19931,"Goodly Lord, what a wit-snapper are you! Then bid them prepare dinner."
19932,"That is done too, sir, only “cover” is the word."
19933,"Will you cover, then, sir?"
19934,"Not so, sir, neither. I know my duty."
19935,Yet more quarrelling with occasion! Wilt thou show the whole wealth of
19936,thy wit in an instant? I pray thee understand a plain man in his plain
19937,"meaning: go to thy fellows, bid them cover the table, serve in the"
19938,"meat, and we will come in to dinner."
19939,"For the table, sir, it shall be served in; for the meat, sir, it shall"
19940,"be covered; for your coming in to dinner, sir, why, let it be as"
19941,humours and conceits shall govern.
19942,"O dear discretion, how his words are suited!"
19943,The fool hath planted in his memory
19944,"An army of good words, and I do know"
19945,"A many fools that stand in better place,"
19946,"Garnish’d like him, that for a tricksy word"
19947,"Defy the matter. How cheer’st thou, Jessica?"
19948,"And now, good sweet, say thy opinion,"
19949,How dost thou like the Lord Bassanio’s wife?
19950,Past all expressing. It is very meet
19951,"The Lord Bassanio live an upright life,"
19952,"For having such a blessing in his lady,"
19953,"He finds the joys of heaven here on earth,"
19954,"And if on earth he do not merit it,"
19955,In reason he should never come to heaven.
19956,"Why, if two gods should play some heavenly match,"
19957,"And on the wager lay two earthly women,"
19958,"And Portia one, there must be something else"
19959,"Pawn’d with the other, for the poor rude world"
19960,Hath not her fellow.
19961,Even such a husband
19962,Hast thou of me as she is for a wife.
19963,"Nay, but ask my opinion too of that."
19964,I will anon. First let us go to dinner.
19965,"Nay, let me praise you while I have a stomach."
19966,"No pray thee, let it serve for table-talk."
19967,"Then howsome’er thou speak’st, ’mong other things"
19968,I shall digest it.
19969,"Well, I’ll set you forth."
19970,SCENE I. Venice. A court of justice.
19971,"Enter the Duke, the Magnificoes, Antonio, Bassanio, Gratiano, Salerio"
19972,"What, is Antonio here?"
19973,"Ready, so please your Grace."
19974,"I am sorry for thee, thou art come to answer"
19975,"A stony adversary, an inhuman wretch,"
19976,"Uncapable of pity, void and empty"
19977,From any dram of mercy.
19978,Your Grace hath ta’en great pains to qualify
19979,"His rigorous course; but since he stands obdurate,"
19980,And that no lawful means can carry me
19981,"Out of his envy’s reach, I do oppose"
19982,"My patience to his fury, and am arm’d"
19983,To suffer with a quietness of spirit
19984,The very tyranny and rage of his.
19985,Go one and call the Jew into the court.
19986,"He is ready at the door. He comes, my lord."
19987,"Make room, and let him stand before our face."
19988,"Shylock, the world thinks, and I think so too,"
19989,That thou but leadest this fashion of thy malice
19990,"To the last hour of act, and then, ’tis thought,"
19991,Thou’lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange
19992,Than is thy strange apparent cruelty;
19993,"And where thou now exacts the penalty,"
19994,"Which is a pound of this poor merchant’s flesh,"
19995,"Thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture,"
19996,"But, touch’d with human gentleness and love,"
19997,"Forgive a moiety of the principal,"
19998,Glancing an eye of pity on his losses
19999,"That have of late so huddled on his back,"
20000,"Enow to press a royal merchant down,"
20001,And pluck commiseration of his state
20002,"From brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint,"
20003,From stubborn Turks and Tartars never train’d
20004,To offices of tender courtesy.
20005,"We all expect a gentle answer, Jew."
20006,"I have possess’d your Grace of what I purpose,"
20007,And by our holy Sabbath have I sworn
20008,To have the due and forfeit of my bond.
20009,"If you deny it, let the danger light"
20010,Upon your charter and your city’s freedom!
20011,You’ll ask me why I rather choose to have
20012,A weight of carrion flesh than to receive
20013,"Three thousand ducats. I’ll not answer that,"
20014,But say it is my humour. Is it answer’d?
20015,"What if my house be troubled with a rat,"
20016,And I be pleas’d to give ten thousand ducats
20017,"To have it ban’d? What, are you answer’d yet?"
20018,Some men there are love not a gaping pig;
20019,Some that are mad if they behold a cat;
20020,"And others, when the bagpipe sings i’ the nose,"
20021,Cannot contain their urine; for affection
20022,"Mistress of passion, sways it to the mood"
20023,"Of what it likes or loathes. Now, for your answer:"
20024,As there is no firm reason to be render’d
20025,"Why he cannot abide a gaping pig,"
20026,"Why he a harmless necessary cat,"
20027,"Why he a woollen bagpipe, but of force"
20028,Must yield to such inevitable shame
20029,"As to offend, himself being offended,"
20030,"So can I give no reason, nor I will not,"
20031,More than a lodg’d hate and a certain loathing
20032,"I bear Antonio, that I follow thus"
20033,A losing suit against him. Are you answered?
20034,"This is no answer, thou unfeeling man,"
20035,To excuse the current of thy cruelty.
20036,I am not bound to please thee with my answer.
20037,Do all men kill the things they do not love?
20038,Hates any man the thing he would not kill?
20039,Every offence is not a hate at first.
20040,"What, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice?"
20041,"I pray you, think you question with the Jew."
20042,You may as well go stand upon the beach
20043,And bid the main flood bate his usual height;
20044,"You may as well use question with the wolf,"
20045,Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb;
20046,You may as well forbid the mountain pines
20047,To wag their high tops and to make no noise
20048,When they are fretten with the gusts of heaven;
20049,You may as well do anything most hard
20050,As seek to soften that—than which what’s harder?—
20051,"His Jewish heart. Therefore, I do beseech you,"
20052,"Make no moe offers, use no farther means,"
20053,But with all brief and plain conveniency.
20054,"Let me have judgment, and the Jew his will."
20055,For thy three thousand ducats here is six.
20056,If every ducat in six thousand ducats
20057,"Were in six parts, and every part a ducat,"
20058,"I would not draw them, I would have my bond."
20059,"How shalt thou hope for mercy, rend’ring none?"
20060,"What judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong?"
20061,"You have among you many a purchas’d slave,"
20062,"Which, like your asses and your dogs and mules,"
20063,"You use in abject and in slavish parts,"
20064,Because you bought them. Shall I say to you
20065,"“Let them be free, marry them to your heirs?"
20066,Why sweat they under burdens? Let their beds
20067,"Be made as soft as yours, and let their palates"
20068,Be season’d with such viands”? You will answer
20069,“The slaves are ours.” So do I answer you:
20070,The pound of flesh which I demand of him
20071,Is dearly bought; ’tis mine and I will have it.
20072,"If you deny me, fie upon your law!"
20073,There is no force in the decrees of Venice.
20074,I stand for judgment. Answer; shall I have it?
20075,"Upon my power I may dismiss this court,"
20076,"Unless Bellario, a learned doctor,"
20077,"Whom I have sent for to determine this,"
20078,"My lord, here stays without"
20079,"A messenger with letters from the doctor,"
20080,New come from Padua.
20081,Bring us the letters. Call the messenger.
20082,"Good cheer, Antonio! What, man, courage yet!"
20083,"The Jew shall have my flesh, blood, bones, and all,"
20084,Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.
20085,"I am a tainted wether of the flock,"
20086,"Meetest for death, the weakest kind of fruit"
20087,"Drops earliest to the ground, and so let me."
20088,"You cannot better be employ’d, Bassanio,"
20089,"Than to live still, and write mine epitaph."
20090,Enter Nerissa dressed like a lawyer’s clerk.
20091,"Came you from Padua, from Bellario?"
20092,"From both, my lord. Bellario greets your Grace."
20093,Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly?
20094,To cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there.
20095,"Not on thy sole but on thy soul, harsh Jew,"
20096,"Thou mak’st thy knife keen. But no metal can,"
20097,"No, not the hangman’s axe, bear half the keenness"
20098,Of thy sharp envy. Can no prayers pierce thee?
20099,"No, none that thou hast wit enough to make."
20100,"O, be thou damn’d, inexecrable dog!"
20101,And for thy life let justice be accus’d;
20102,"Thou almost mak’st me waver in my faith,"
20103,To hold opinion with Pythagoras
20104,That souls of animals infuse themselves
20105,Into the trunks of men. Thy currish spirit
20106,"Govern’d a wolf who, hang’d for human slaughter,"
20107,"Even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet,"
20108,"And whilst thou layest in thy unhallowed dam,"
20109,Infus’d itself in thee; for thy desires
20110,"Are wolfish, bloody, starv’d and ravenous."
20111,"Till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond,"
20112,Thou but offend’st thy lungs to speak so loud.
20113,"Repair thy wit, good youth, or it will fall"
20114,To cureless ruin. I stand here for law.
20115,This letter from Bellario doth commend
20116,A young and learned doctor to our court.
20117,"He attendeth here hard by,"
20118,"To know your answer, whether you’ll admit him."
20119,With all my heart: some three or four of you
20120,Go give him courteous conduct to this place.
20121,"Meantime, the court shall hear Bellario’s letter."
20122,"letter I am very sick, but in the instant that your messenger came, in"
20123,loving visitation was with me a young doctor of Rome. His name is
20124,Balthazar. I acquainted him with the cause in controversy between the
20125,Jew and Antonio the merchant. We turn’d o’er many books together. He is
20126,"furnished with my opinion, which, bettered with his own learning (the"
20127,"greatness whereof I cannot enough commend), comes with him at my"
20128,importunity to fill up your Grace’s request in my stead. I beseech you
20129,let his lack of years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend
20130,"estimation, for I never knew so young a body with so old a head. I"
20131,"leave him to your gracious acceptance, whose trial shall better publish"
20132,"You hear the learn’d Bellario what he writes,"
20133,"And here, I take it, is the doctor come."
20134,Enter Portia dressed like a doctor of laws.
20135,Give me your hand. Come you from old Bellario?
20136,"I did, my lord."
20137,You are welcome. Take your place.
20138,Are you acquainted with the difference
20139,That holds this present question in the court?
20140,I am informed throughly of the cause.
20141,Which is the merchant here? And which the Jew?
20142,"Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth."
20143,Is your name Shylock?
20144,Shylock is my name.
20145,"Of a strange nature is the suit you follow,"
20146,Yet in such rule that the Venetian law
20147,Cannot impugn you as you do proceed.
20148,"Ay, so he says."
20149,Do you confess the bond?
20150,Then must the Jew be merciful.
20151,On what compulsion must I? Tell me that.
20152,"The quality of mercy is not strain’d,"
20153,It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
20154,"Upon the place beneath. It is twice blest,"
20155,It blesseth him that gives and him that takes.
20156,’Tis mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes
20157,The throned monarch better than his crown.
20158,"His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,"
20159,"The attribute to awe and majesty,"
20160,Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;
20161,"But mercy is above this sceptred sway,"
20162,"It is enthroned in the hearts of kings,"
20163,It is an attribute to God himself;
20164,And earthly power doth then show likest God’s
20165,"When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,"
20166,"Though justice be thy plea, consider this,"
20167,That in the course of justice none of us
20168,"Should see salvation. We do pray for mercy,"
20169,And that same prayer doth teach us all to render
20170,The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much
20171,"To mitigate the justice of thy plea,"
20172,"Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice"
20173,Must needs give sentence ’gainst the merchant there.
20174,"My deeds upon my head! I crave the law,"
20175,The penalty and forfeit of my bond.
20176,Is he not able to discharge the money?
20177,"Yes, here I tender it for him in the court,"
20178,"Yea, twice the sum, if that will not suffice,"
20179,I will be bound to pay it ten times o’er
20180,"On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart."
20181,"If this will not suffice, it must appear"
20182,"That malice bears down truth. And I beseech you,"
20183,Wrest once the law to your authority.
20184,"To do a great right, do a little wrong,"
20185,And curb this cruel devil of his will.
20186,"It must not be, there is no power in Venice"
20187,Can alter a decree established;
20188,"’Twill be recorded for a precedent,"
20189,And many an error by the same example
20190,Will rush into the state. It cannot be.
20191,"A Daniel come to judgment! Yea, a Daniel!"
20192,"O wise young judge, how I do honour thee!"
20193,I pray you let me look upon the bond.
20194,"Here ’tis, most reverend doctor, here it is."
20195,"Shylock, there’s thrice thy money offered thee."
20196,"An oath, an oath! I have an oath in heaven."
20197,Shall I lay perjury upon my soul?
20198,"No, not for Venice."
20199,"Why, this bond is forfeit,"
20200,And lawfully by this the Jew may claim
20201,"A pound of flesh, to be by him cut off"
20202,"Nearest the merchant’s heart. Be merciful,"
20203,Take thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond.
20204,When it is paid according to the tenour.
20205,It doth appear you are a worthy judge;
20206,You know the law; your exposition
20207,"Hath been most sound. I charge you by the law,"
20208,"Whereof you are a well-deserving pillar,"
20209,Proceed to judgment. By my soul I swear
20210,There is no power in the tongue of man
20211,To alter me. I stay here on my bond.
20212,Most heartily I do beseech the court
20213,To give the judgment.
20214,"Why then, thus it is:"
20215,You must prepare your bosom for his knife.
20216,O noble judge! O excellent young man!
20217,For the intent and purpose of the law
20218,"Hath full relation to the penalty,"
20219,Which here appeareth due upon the bond.
20220,"’Tis very true. O wise and upright judge,"
20221,How much more elder art thou than thy looks!
20222,Therefore lay bare your bosom.
20223,"So says the bond, doth it not, noble judge?"
20224,“Nearest his heart”: those are the very words.
20225,It is so. Are there balance here to weigh
20226,I have them ready.
20227,"Have by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge,"
20228,"To stop his wounds, lest he do bleed to death."
20229,Is it so nominated in the bond?
20230,"It is not so express’d, but what of that?"
20231,’Twere good you do so much for charity.
20232,I cannot find it; ’tis not in the bond.
20233,"You, merchant, have you anything to say?"
20234,But little. I am arm’d and well prepar’d.
20235,"Give me your hand, Bassanio. Fare you well,"
20236,"Grieve not that I am fallen to this for you,"
20237,For herein Fortune shows herself more kind
20238,Than is her custom: it is still her use
20239,"To let the wretched man outlive his wealth,"
20240,To view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow
20241,"An age of poverty, from which ling’ring penance"
20242,Of such misery doth she cut me off.
20243,"Commend me to your honourable wife,"
20244,"Tell her the process of Antonio’s end,"
20245,"Say how I lov’d you, speak me fair in death."
20246,"And when the tale is told, bid her be judge"
20247,Whether Bassanio had not once a love.
20248,Repent but you that you shall lose your friend
20249,And he repents not that he pays your debt.
20250,"For if the Jew do cut but deep enough,"
20251,I’ll pay it instantly with all my heart.
20252,"Antonio, I am married to a wife"
20253,"Which is as dear to me as life itself,"
20254,"But life itself, my wife, and all the world,"
20255,Are not with me esteem’d above thy life.
20256,"I would lose all, ay, sacrifice them all"
20257,"Here to this devil, to deliver you."
20258,Your wife would give you little thanks for that
20259,If she were by to hear you make the offer.
20260,I have a wife who I protest I love.
20261,"I would she were in heaven, so she could"
20262,Entreat some power to change this currish Jew.
20263,"’Tis well you offer it behind her back,"
20264,The wish would make else an unquiet house.
20265,These be the Christian husbands! I have a daughter—
20266,Would any of the stock of Barabbas
20267,"Had been her husband, rather than a Christian!"
20268,"We trifle time, I pray thee, pursue sentence."
20269,"A pound of that same merchant’s flesh is thine,"
20270,The court awards it and the law doth give it.
20271,And you must cut this flesh from off his breast.
20272,The law allows it and the court awards it.
20273,"Most learned judge! A sentence! Come, prepare."
20274,"Tarry a little, there is something else."
20275,This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood.
20276,The words expressly are “a pound of flesh”:
20277,"Take then thy bond, take thou thy pound of flesh,"
20278,"But in the cutting it, if thou dost shed"
20279,"One drop of Christian blood, thy lands and goods"
20280,"Are, by the laws of Venice, confiscate"
20281,Unto the state of Venice.
20282,"O upright judge! Mark, Jew. O learned judge!"
20283,Is that the law?
20284,Thyself shalt see the act.
20285,"For, as thou urgest justice, be assur’d"
20286,Thou shalt have justice more than thou desir’st.
20287,"O learned judge! Mark, Jew, a learned judge!"
20288,I take this offer then. Pay the bond thrice
20289,And let the Christian go.
20290,Here is the money.
20291,The Jew shall have all justice. Soft! no haste!
20292,He shall have nothing but the penalty.
20293,"O Jew, an upright judge, a learned judge!"
20294,Therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh.
20295,"Shed thou no blood, nor cut thou less nor more,"
20296,But just a pound of flesh: if thou tak’st more
20297,"Or less than a just pound, be it but so much"
20298,"As makes it light or heavy in the substance,"
20299,Or the division of the twentieth part
20300,"Of one poor scruple, nay, if the scale do turn"
20301,"But in the estimation of a hair,"
20302,"Thou diest, and all thy goods are confiscate."
20303,"A second Daniel, a Daniel, Jew!"
20304,"Now, infidel, I have you on the hip."
20305,Why doth the Jew pause? Take thy forfeiture.
20306,"Give me my principal, and let me go."
20307,I have it ready for thee. Here it is.
20308,"He hath refus’d it in the open court,"
20309,He shall have merely justice and his bond.
20310,"A Daniel still say I, a second Daniel!"
20311,"I thank thee, Jew, for teaching me that word."
20312,Shall I not have barely my principal?
20313,Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture
20314,"To be so taken at thy peril, Jew."
20315,"Why, then the devil give him good of it!"
20316,I’ll stay no longer question.
20317,The law hath yet another hold on you.
20318,"It is enacted in the laws of Venice,"
20319,If it be proved against an alien
20320,That by direct or indirect attempts
20321,"He seek the life of any citizen,"
20322,The party ’gainst the which he doth contrive
20323,Shall seize one half his goods; the other half
20324,"Comes to the privy coffer of the state,"
20325,And the offender’s life lies in the mercy
20326,"Of the Duke only, ’gainst all other voice."
20327,In which predicament I say thou stand’st;
20328,For it appears by manifest proceeding
20329,"That indirectly, and directly too,"
20330,Thou hast contrived against the very life
20331,Of the defendant; and thou hast incurr’d
20332,The danger formerly by me rehears’d.
20333,"Down, therefore, and beg mercy of the Duke."
20334,"Beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself,"
20335,"And yet, thy wealth being forfeit to the state,"
20336,Thou hast not left the value of a cord;
20337,Therefore thou must be hang’d at the state’s charge.
20338,"That thou shalt see the difference of our spirit,"
20339,I pardon thee thy life before thou ask it.
20340,"For half thy wealth, it is Antonio’s;"
20341,"The other half comes to the general state,"
20342,Which humbleness may drive unto a fine.
20343,"Ay, for the state, not for Antonio."
20344,"Nay, take my life and all, pardon not that."
20345,You take my house when you do take the prop
20346,That doth sustain my house; you take my life
20347,When you do take the means whereby I live.
20348,"What mercy can you render him, Antonio?"
20349,"A halter gratis, nothing else, for God’s sake!"
20350,So please my lord the Duke and all the court
20351,"To quit the fine for one half of his goods,"
20352,"I am content, so he will let me have"
20353,"The other half in use, to render it"
20354,Upon his death unto the gentleman
20355,That lately stole his daughter.
20356,"Two things provided more, that for this favour,"
20357,He presently become a Christian;
20358,"The other, that he do record a gift,"
20359,"Here in the court, of all he dies possess’d"
20360,Unto his son Lorenzo and his daughter.
20361,"He shall do this, or else I do recant"
20362,The pardon that I late pronounced here.
20363,"Art thou contented, Jew? What dost thou say?"
20364,"Clerk, draw a deed of gift."
20365,I pray you give me leave to go from hence;
20366,I am not well; send the deed after me
20367,And I will sign it.
20368,"Get thee gone, but do it."
20369,In christ’ning shalt thou have two god-fathers.
20370,"Had I been judge, thou shouldst have had ten more,"
20371,"To bring thee to the gallows, not to the font."
20372,"Sir, I entreat you home with me to dinner."
20373,"I humbly do desire your Grace of pardon,"
20374,"I must away this night toward Padua,"
20375,And it is meet I presently set forth.
20376,I am sorry that your leisure serves you not.
20377,"Antonio, gratify this gentleman,"
20378,For in my mind you are much bound to him.
20379,"Most worthy gentleman, I and my friend"
20380,Have by your wisdom been this day acquitted
20381,"Of grievous penalties, in lieu whereof,"
20382,Three thousand ducats due unto the Jew
20383,We freely cope your courteous pains withal.
20384,"And stand indebted, over and above"
20385,In love and service to you evermore.
20386,"He is well paid that is well satisfied,"
20387,"And I delivering you, am satisfied,"
20388,"And therein do account myself well paid,"
20389,My mind was never yet more mercenary.
20390,"I pray you know me when we meet again,"
20391,"I wish you well, and so I take my leave."
20392,"Dear sir, of force I must attempt you further."
20393,"Take some remembrance of us as a tribute,"
20394,"Not as fee. Grant me two things, I pray you,"
20395,"Not to deny me, and to pardon me."
20396,"You press me far, and therefore I will yield."
20397,"Do not draw back your hand; I’ll take no more,"
20398,And you in love shall not deny me this.
20399,"This ring, good sir? Alas, it is a trifle,"
20400,I will not shame myself to give you this.
20401,"I will have nothing else but only this,"
20402,And now methinks I have a mind to it.
20403,There’s more depends on this than on the value.
20404,"The dearest ring in Venice will I give you,"
20405,"And find it out by proclamation,"
20406,Only for this I pray you pardon me.
20407,"I see, sir, you are liberal in offers."
20408,"You taught me first to beg, and now methinks"
20409,You teach me how a beggar should be answer’d.
20410,"Good sir, this ring was given me by my wife,"
20411,"And when she put it on, she made me vow"
20412,"That I should neither sell, nor give, nor lose it."
20413,That ’scuse serves many men to save their gifts.
20414,"And if your wife be not a mad-woman,"
20415,"And know how well I have deserv’d this ring,"
20416,She would not hold out enemy for ever
20417,"For giving it to me. Well, peace be with you!"
20418,"My Lord Bassanio, let him have the ring."
20419,Let his deservings and my love withal
20420,Be valued ’gainst your wife’s commandment.
20421,"Go, Gratiano, run and overtake him;"
20422,"Give him the ring, and bring him if thou canst"
20423,"Unto Antonio’s house. Away, make haste."
20424,"Come, you and I will thither presently,"
20425,And in the morning early will we both
20426,"Fly toward Belmont. Come, Antonio."
20427,SCENE II. The same. A street.
20428,Enter Portia and Nerissa.
20429,"Inquire the Jew’s house out, give him this deed,"
20430,"And let him sign it, we’ll away tonight,"
20431,And be a day before our husbands home.
20432,This deed will be well welcome to Lorenzo.
20433,"Fair sir, you are well o’erta’en."
20434,"My Lord Bassanio upon more advice,"
20435,"Hath sent you here this ring, and doth entreat"
20436,Your company at dinner.
20437,"His ring I do accept most thankfully,"
20438,"And so I pray you tell him. Furthermore,"
20439,I pray you show my youth old Shylock’s house.
20440,That will I do.
20441,"Sir, I would speak with you."
20442,"I’ll see if I can get my husband’s ring,"
20443,Which I did make him swear to keep for ever.
20444,That they did give the rings away to men;
20445,"But we’ll outface them, and outswear them too."
20446,Away! make haste! Thou know’st where I will tarry.
20447,"Come, good sir, will you show me to this house?"
20448,SCENE I. Belmont. The avenue to Portia’s house.
20449,Enter Lorenzo and Jessica.
20450,"The moon shines bright. In such a night as this,"
20451,"When the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees,"
20452,"And they did make no noise, in such a night,"
20453,"Troilus methinks mounted the Trojan walls,"
20454,And sigh’d his soul toward the Grecian tents
20455,Where Cressid lay that night.
20456,In such a night
20457,"Did Thisbe fearfully o’ertrip the dew,"
20458,"And saw the lion’s shadow ere himself,"
20459,And ran dismay’d away.
20460,In such a night
20461,Stood Dido with a willow in her hand
20462,"Upon the wild sea-banks, and waft her love"
20463,To come again to Carthage.
20464,In such a night
20465,Medea gathered the enchanted herbs
20466,That did renew old Æson.
20467,In such a night
20468,"Did Jessica steal from the wealthy Jew,"
20469,And with an unthrift love did run from Venice
20470,As far as Belmont.
20471,In such a night
20472,"Did young Lorenzo swear he loved her well,"
20473,"Stealing her soul with many vows of faith,"
20474,And ne’er a true one.
20475,In such a night
20476,"Did pretty Jessica, like a little shrew,"
20477,"Slander her love, and he forgave it her."
20478,I would out-night you did no body come;
20479,"But hark, I hear the footing of a man."
20480,Who comes so fast in silence of the night?
20481,"A friend! What friend? Your name, I pray you, friend?"
20482,"Stephano is my name, and I bring word"
20483,My mistress will before the break of day
20484,Be here at Belmont. She doth stray about
20485,By holy crosses where she kneels and prays
20486,For happy wedlock hours.
20487,Who comes with her?
20488,None but a holy hermit and her maid.
20489,I pray you is my master yet return’d?
20490,"He is not, nor we have not heard from him."
20491,"But go we in, I pray thee, Jessica,"
20492,And ceremoniously let us prepare
20493,Some welcome for the mistress of the house.
20494,"LAUNCELET. Sola, sola! wo ha, ho! sola, sola!"
20495,"Sola! Did you see Master Lorenzo? Master Lorenzo! Sola, sola!"
20496,"Leave holloaing, man. Here!"
20497,Tell him there’s a post come from my master with his horn full of good
20498,news. My master will be here ere morning.
20499,"Sweet soul, let’s in, and there expect their coming."
20500,And yet no matter; why should we go in?
20501,"My friend Stephano, signify, I pray you,"
20502,"Within the house, your mistress is at hand,"
20503,And bring your music forth into the air.
20504,How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank!
20505,Here will we sit and let the sounds of music
20506,Creep in our ears; soft stillness and the night
20507,Become the touches of sweet harmony.
20508,"Sit, Jessica. Look how the floor of heaven"
20509,Is thick inlaid with patens of bright gold.
20510,There’s not the smallest orb which thou behold’st
20511,"But in his motion like an angel sings,"
20512,Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubins;
20513,"Such harmony is in immortal souls,"
20514,But whilst this muddy vesture of decay
20515,"Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it."
20516,"Come, ho! and wake Diana with a hymn."
20517,"With sweetest touches pierce your mistress’ ear,"
20518,And draw her home with music.
20519,I am never merry when I hear sweet music.
20520,"The reason is, your spirits are attentive."
20521,For do but note a wild and wanton herd
20522,"Or race of youthful and unhandled colts,"
20523,"Fetching mad bounds, bellowing and neighing loud,"
20524,"Which is the hot condition of their blood,"
20525,"If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound,"
20526,"Or any air of music touch their ears,"
20527,"You shall perceive them make a mutual stand,"
20528,Their savage eyes turn’d to a modest gaze
20529,By the sweet power of music: therefore the poet
20530,"Did feign that Orpheus drew trees, stones, and floods,"
20531,"Since naught so stockish, hard, and full of rage,"
20532,But music for the time doth change his nature.
20533,"The man that hath no music in himself,"
20534,"Nor is not mov’d with concord of sweet sounds,"
20535,"Is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils;"
20536,"The motions of his spirit are dull as night,"
20537,And his affections dark as Erebus.
20538,Let no such man be trusted. Mark the music.
20539,Enter Portia and Nerissa.
20540,That light we see is burning in my hall.
20541,How far that little candle throws his beams!
20542,So shines a good deed in a naughty world.
20543,When the moon shone we did not see the candle.
20544,So doth the greater glory dim the less.
20545,A substitute shines brightly as a king
20546,"Until a king be by, and then his state"
20547,"Empties itself, as doth an inland brook"
20548,Into the main of waters. Music! hark!
20549,"It is your music, madam, of the house."
20550,"Nothing is good, I see, without respect."
20551,Methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day.
20552,"Silence bestows that virtue on it, madam."
20553,The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark
20554,When neither is attended; and I think
20555,"The nightingale, if she should sing by day"
20556,"When every goose is cackling, would be thought"
20557,No better a musician than the wren.
20558,How many things by season season’d are
20559,To their right praise and true perfection!
20560,"Peace! How the moon sleeps with Endymion,"
20561,And would not be awak’d!
20562,"That is the voice,"
20563,"Or I am much deceiv’d, of Portia."
20564,"He knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo,"
20565,By the bad voice.
20566,"Dear lady, welcome home."
20567,"We have been praying for our husbands’ welfare,"
20568,"Which speed, we hope, the better for our words."
20569,"Madam, they are not yet;"
20570,But there is come a messenger before
20571,To signify their coming.
20572,"Give order to my servants, that they take"
20573,"No note at all of our being absent hence,"
20574,"Nor you, Lorenzo; Jessica, nor you."
20575,"Your husband is at hand, I hear his trumpet."
20576,"We are no tell-tales, madam, fear you not."
20577,"This night methinks is but the daylight sick,"
20578,It looks a little paler. ’Tis a day
20579,Such as the day is when the sun is hid.
20580,"Enter Bassanio, Antonio, Gratiano and their Followers."
20581,"We should hold day with the Antipodes,"
20582,If you would walk in absence of the sun.
20583,"Let me give light, but let me not be light,"
20584,"For a light wife doth make a heavy husband,"
20585,And never be Bassanio so for me.
20586,"But God sort all! You are welcome home, my lord."
20587,"I thank you, madam. Give welcome to my friend."
20588,"This is the man, this is Antonio,"
20589,To whom I am so infinitely bound.
20590,"You should in all sense be much bound to him,"
20591,"For, as I hear, he was much bound for you."
20592,No more than I am well acquitted of.
20593,"Sir, you are very welcome to our house."
20594,"It must appear in other ways than words,"
20595,Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy.
20596,"In faith, I gave it to the judge’s clerk."
20597,"Would he were gelt that had it, for my part,"
20598,"Since you do take it, love, so much at heart."
20599,"A quarrel, ho, already! What’s the matter?"
20600,"About a hoop of gold, a paltry ring"
20601,"That she did give me, whose posy was"
20602,For all the world like cutlers’ poetry
20603,"Upon a knife, “Love me, and leave me not.”"
20604,"What talk you of the posy, or the value?"
20605,"You swore to me when I did give it you,"
20606,"That you would wear it till your hour of death,"
20607,And that it should lie with you in your grave.
20608,"Though not for me, yet for your vehement oaths,"
20609,You should have been respective and have kept it.
20610,"Gave it a judge’s clerk! No, God’s my judge,"
20611,The clerk will ne’er wear hair on’s face that had it.
20612,"He will, and if he live to be a man."
20613,"Ay, if a woman live to be a man."
20614,"Now, by this hand, I gave it to a youth,"
20615,"A kind of boy, a little scrubbed boy,"
20616,"No higher than thyself, the judge’s clerk,"
20617,"A prating boy that begg’d it as a fee,"
20618,I could not for my heart deny it him.
20619,"You were to blame,—I must be plain with you,—"
20620,"To part so slightly with your wife’s first gift,"
20621,"A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger,"
20622,And so riveted with faith unto your flesh.
20623,"I gave my love a ring, and made him swear"
20624,"Never to part with it, and here he stands."
20625,I dare be sworn for him he would not leave it
20626,Nor pluck it from his finger for the wealth
20627,"That the world masters. Now, in faith, Gratiano,"
20628,"You give your wife too unkind a cause of grief,"
20629,An ’twere to me I should be mad at it.
20630,And swear I lost the ring defending it.
20631,My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away
20632,"Unto the judge that begg’d it, and indeed"
20633,"Deserv’d it too. And then the boy, his clerk,"
20634,"That took some pains in writing, he begg’d mine,"
20635,And neither man nor master would take aught
20636,But the two rings.
20637,"What ring gave you, my lord?"
20638,"Not that, I hope, which you receiv’d of me."
20639,"If I could add a lie unto a fault,"
20640,"I would deny it, but you see my finger"
20641,"Hath not the ring upon it, it is gone."
20642,Even so void is your false heart of truth.
20643,"By heaven, I will ne’er come in your bed"
20644,Until I see the ring.
20645,Nor I in yours
20646,Till I again see mine!
20647,"If you did know to whom I gave the ring,"
20648,"If you did know for whom I gave the ring,"
20649,"And would conceive for what I gave the ring,"
20650,"And how unwillingly I left the ring,"
20651,"When nought would be accepted but the ring,"
20652,You would abate the strength of your displeasure.
20653,"If you had known the virtue of the ring,"
20654,"Or half her worthiness that gave the ring,"
20655,"Or your own honour to contain the ring,"
20656,You would not then have parted with the ring.
20657,"What man is there so much unreasonable,"
20658,If you had pleas’d to have defended it
20659,"With any terms of zeal, wanted the modesty"
20660,To urge the thing held as a ceremony?
20661,Nerissa teaches me what to believe:
20662,I’ll die for’t but some woman had the ring.
20663,"No, by my honour, madam, by my soul,"
20664,"No woman had it, but a civil doctor,"
20665,"Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me,"
20666,"And begg’d the ring, the which I did deny him,"
20667,"And suffer’d him to go displeas’d away,"
20668,Even he that had held up the very life
20669,"Of my dear friend. What should I say, sweet lady?"
20670,I was enforc’d to send it after him.
20671,I was beset with shame and courtesy.
20672,My honour would not let ingratitude
20673,"So much besmear it. Pardon me, good lady;"
20674,"For by these blessed candles of the night,"
20675,"Had you been there, I think you would have begg’d"
20676,The ring of me to give the worthy doctor.
20677,"Let not that doctor e’er come near my house,"
20678,"Since he hath got the jewel that I loved,"
20679,"And that which you did swear to keep for me,"
20680,"I will become as liberal as you,"
20681,"I’ll not deny him anything I have,"
20682,"No, not my body, nor my husband’s bed."
20683,"Know him I shall, I am well sure of it."
20684,"Lie not a night from home. Watch me like Argus,"
20685,"If you do not, if I be left alone,"
20686,"Now by mine honour which is yet mine own,"
20687,I’ll have that doctor for mine bedfellow.
20688,And I his clerk. Therefore be well advis’d
20689,How you do leave me to mine own protection.
20690,"Well, do you so. Let not me take him then,"
20691,"For if I do, I’ll mar the young clerk’s pen."
20692,I am th’ unhappy subject of these quarrels.
20693,"Sir, grieve not you. You are welcome notwithstanding."
20694,"Portia, forgive me this enforced wrong,"
20695,And in the hearing of these many friends
20696,"I swear to thee, even by thine own fair eyes,"
20697,Wherein I see myself—
20698,Mark you but that!
20699,"In both my eyes he doubly sees himself,"
20700,"In each eye one. Swear by your double self,"
20701,And there’s an oath of credit.
20702,"Nay, but hear me."
20703,"Pardon this fault, and by my soul I swear"
20704,I never more will break an oath with thee.
20705,"I once did lend my body for his wealth,"
20706,Which but for him that had your husband’s ring
20707,"Had quite miscarried. I dare be bound again,"
20708,"My soul upon the forfeit, that your lord"
20709,Will never more break faith advisedly.
20710,"Then you shall be his surety. Give him this,"
20711,And bid him keep it better than the other.
20712,"Here, Lord Bassanio, swear to keep this ring."
20713,"By heaven, it is the same I gave the doctor!"
20714,"I had it of him: pardon me, Bassanio,"
20715,"For by this ring, the doctor lay with me."
20716,"And pardon me, my gentle Gratiano,"
20717,"For that same scrubbed boy, the doctor’s clerk,"
20718,"In lieu of this, last night did lie with me."
20719,"Why, this is like the mending of highways"
20720,"In summer, where the ways are fair enough."
20721,"What, are we cuckolds ere we have deserv’d it?"
20722,Speak not so grossly. You are all amaz’d.
20723,Here is a letter; read it at your leisure.
20724,It comes from Padua from Bellario.
20725,"There you shall find that Portia was the doctor,"
20726,"Nerissa there, her clerk. Lorenzo here"
20727,"Shall witness I set forth as soon as you,"
20728,And even but now return’d. I have not yet
20729,"Enter’d my house. Antonio, you are welcome,"
20730,And I have better news in store for you
20731,Than you expect: unseal this letter soon.
20732,There you shall find three of your argosies
20733,Are richly come to harbour suddenly.
20734,You shall not know by what strange accident
20735,I chanced on this letter.
20736,"Were you the doctor, and I knew you not?"
20737,Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold?
20738,"Ay, but the clerk that never means to do it,"
20739,Unless he live until he be a man.
20740,"Sweet doctor, you shall be my bedfellow."
20741,"When I am absent, then lie with my wife."
20742,"Sweet lady, you have given me life and living;"
20743,For here I read for certain that my ships
20744,Are safely come to road.
20745,My clerk hath some good comforts too for you.
20746,"Ay, and I’ll give them him without a fee."
20747,"There do I give to you and Jessica,"
20748,"From the rich Jew, a special deed of gift,"
20749,"After his death, of all he dies possess’d of."
20750,"Fair ladies, you drop manna in the way"
20751,"It is almost morning,"
20752,And yet I am sure you are not satisfied
20753,"Of these events at full. Let us go in,"
20754,"And charge us there upon inter’gatories,"
20755,And we will answer all things faithfully.
20756,Let it be so. The first inter’gatory
20757,"That my Nerissa shall be sworn on is,"
20758,"Whether till the next night she had rather stay,"
20759,"Or go to bed now, being two hours to day."
20760,"But were the day come, I should wish it dark"
20761,Till I were couching with the doctor’s clerk.
20762,"Well, while I live, I’ll fear no other thing"
20763,So sore as keeping safe Nerissa’s ring.

20824,The luce is the fresh fish. The salt fish is an old coat.
20825,"I may quarter, coz."
20826,"You may, by marrying."
20827,"It is marring indeed, if he quarter it."

20843,"and seven hundred pounds of moneys, and gold, and silver, is her"
20844,grandsire upon his death’s-bed—Got deliver to a joyful
20845,"resurrections!—give, when she is able to overtake seventeen years old."
20846,"It were a goot motion if we leave our pribbles and prabbles, and desire"
20847,a marriage between Master Abraham and Mistress Anne Page.
20848,Did her grandsire leave her seven hundred pound?
20849,"Ay, and her father is make her a petter penny."
20850,I know the young gentlewoman; she has good gifts.
20851,"Seven hundred pounds, and possibilities, is goot gifts."
20852,"Well, let us see honest Master Page. Is Falstaff there?"
20853,Shall I tell you a lie? I do despise a liar as I do despise one that is
20854,"false, or as I despise one that is not true. The knight Sir John is"
20855,"there, and I beseech you be ruled by your well-willers. I will peat the"
20856,door for Master Page.
20857,"What, ho! Got pless your house here!"
20858,"Here is Got’s plessing, and your friend, and Justice Shallow, and here"
20859,"young Master Slender, that peradventures shall tell you another tale,"
20860,if matters grow to your likings.
20861,"I am glad to see your worships well. I thank you for my venison, Master"
20862,"Master Page, I am glad to see you, much good do it your good heart! I"
20863,wished your venison better; it was ill killed. How doth good Mistress
20864,"Page? And I thank you always with my heart, la, with my heart."
20865,"Sir, I thank you."
20866,"Sir, I thank you; by yea and no, I do."
20867,"I am glad to see you, good Master Slender."
20868,"How does your fallow greyhound, sir? I heard say he was outrun on"
20869,"It could not be judged, sir."
20870,"You’ll not confess, you’ll not confess."
20871,That he will not. ’Tis your fault; ’tis your fault. ’Tis a good dog.
20872,"Sir, he’s a good dog, and a fair dog, can there be more said? He is"
20873,"good, and fair. Is Sir John Falstaff here?"
20874,"Sir, he is within; and I would I could do a good office between you."
20875,It is spoke as a Christians ought to speak.
20876,"He hath wronged me, Master Page."
20877,"Sir, he doth in some sort confess it."
20878,"If it be confessed, it is not redressed. Is not that so, Master Page?"
20879,"He hath wronged me, indeed he hath, at a word, he hath. Believe me."
20880,"Robert Shallow, esquire, saith he is wronged."
20881,Here comes Sir John.
20882,"Enter Sir John Falstaff, Bardolph, Nym and Pistol."
20883,"Now, Master Shallow, you’ll complain of me to the King?"
20884,"Knight, you have beaten my men, killed my deer, and broke open my"
20885,But not kissed your keeper’s daughter!
20886,"Tut, a pin! This shall be answered."
20887,I will answer it straight: I have done all this. That is now answered.
20888,The Council shall know this.
20889,’Twere better for you if it were known in counsel: you’ll be laughed
20890,"_Pauca verba_, Sir John; goot worts."
20891,"Good worts? Good cabbage!—Slender, I broke your head. What matter have"
20892,"Marry, sir, I have matter in my head against you, and against your"
20893,"cony-catching rascals, Bardolph, Nym, and Pistol. They carried me to"
20894,"the tavern and made me drunk, and afterwards picked my pocket."
20895,"Ay, it is no matter."
20896,"Ay, it is no matter."
20897,"Slice, I say! _Pauca, pauca_, slice, that’s my humour."
20898,"Where’s Simple, my man? Can you tell, cousin?"
20899,"Peace, I pray you. Now let us understand; there is three umpires in"
20900,"this matter, as I understand: that is, Master Page, _fidelicet_ Master"
20901,"Page; and there is myself, _fidelicet_ myself; and the three party is,"
20902,"lastly and finally, mine host of the Garter."
20903,We three to hear it and end it between them.
20904,"Fery goot. I will make a prief of it in my notebook, and we will"
20905,afterwards ’ork upon the cause with as great discreetly as we can.
20906,He hears with ears.
20907,"The tevil and his tam! What phrase is this, “He hears with ear”? Why,"
20908,"Pistol, did you pick Master Slender’s purse?"
20909,"Ay, by these gloves, did he, or I would I might never come in mine own"
20910,"great chamber again else! Of seven groats in mill-sixpences, and two"
20911,Edward shovel-boards that cost me two shilling and two pence a-piece of
20912,"Yed Miller, by these gloves."
20913,"Is this true, Pistol?"
20914,"No, it is false, if it is a pick-purse."
20915,"Ha, thou mountain-foreigner!—Sir John and master mine,"
20916,I combat challenge of this latten bilbo.—
20917,Word of denial in thy _labras_ here!
20918,"Word of denial! Froth and scum, thou liest."
20919,"Be avised, sir, and pass good humours. I will say “marry trap with"
20920,"you”, if you run the nuthook’s humour on me. That is the very note of"
20921,"By this hat, then, he in the red face had it. For though I cannot"
20922,"remember what I did when you made me drunk, yet I am not altogether an"
20923,"What say you, Scarlet and John?"
20924,"Why, sir, for my part, I say the gentleman had drunk himself out of his"
20925,"It is his “five senses”. Fie, what the ignorance is!"
20926,"And being fap, sir, was, as they say, cashiered; and so conclusions"
20927,"Ay, you spake in Latin then too; but ’tis no matter. I’ll ne’er be"
20928,"drunk whilst I live again, but in honest, civil, godly company, for"
20929,"this trick. If I be drunk, I’ll be drunk with those that have the fear"
20930,"of God, and not with drunken knaves."
20931,"So Got ’udge me, that is a virtuous mind."
20932,"You hear all these matters denied, gentlemen; you hear it."
20933,"Enter Mistress Ford, Mistress Page and her daughter Anne Page with"
20934,"Nay, daughter, carry the wine in, we’ll drink within."
20935,"O heaven, this is Mistress Anne Page."
20936,"How now, Mistress Ford?"
20937,"Mistress Ford, by my troth, you are very well met. By your leave, good"
20938,"Wife, bid these gentlemen welcome. Come, we have a hot venison pasty to"
20939,"dinner. Come, gentlemen, I hope we shall drink down all unkindness."
20940,I had rather than forty shillings I had my book of _Songs and Sonnets_
20941,"How now, Simple, where have you been? I must wait on myself, must I?"
20942,"You have not the _Book of Riddles_ about you, have you?"
20943,"_Book of Riddles?_ Why, did you not lend it to Alice Shortcake upon"
20944,"Allhallowmas last, a fortnight afore Michaelmas?"
20945,Enter Shallow and Sir Hugh Evans.
20946,"Come, coz; come, coz, we stay for you. A word with you, coz. Marry,"
20947,"this, coz: there is, as ’twere, a tender, a kind of tender, made afar"
20948,off by Sir Hugh here. Do you understand me?
20949,"Ay, sir, you shall find me reasonable. If it be so, I shall do that"
20950,"Nay, but understand me."
20951,"So I do, sir."
20952,"Give ear to his motions, Master Slender. I will description the matter"
20953,"to you, if you be capacity of it."
20954,"Nay, I will do as my cousin Shallow says. I pray you pardon me, he’s a"
20955,"Justice of Peace in his country, simple though I stand here."
20956,But that is not the question. The question is concerning your marriage.
20957,"Ay, there’s the point, sir."
20958,"Marry, is it; the very point of it—to Mistress Anne Page."
20959,"Why, if it be so, I will marry her upon any reasonable demands."
20960,But can you affection the ’oman? Let us command to know that of your
20961,"mouth, or of your lips; for divers philosophers hold that the lips is"
20962,"parcel of the mouth. Therefore, precisely, can you carry your good will"
20963,"Cousin Abraham Slender, can you love her?"
20964,"I hope, sir, I will do as it shall become one that would do reason."
20965,"Nay, Got’s lords and his ladies! You must speak possitable, if you can"
20966,carry her your desires towards her.
20967,"That you must. Will you, upon good dowry, marry her?"
20968,"I will do a greater thing than that, upon your request, cousin, in any"
20969,"Nay, conceive me, conceive me, sweet coz. What I do is to pleasure you,"
20970,coz. Can you love the maid?
20971,"I will marry her, sir, at your request. But if there be no great love"
20972,"in the beginning, yet heaven may decrease it upon better acquaintance,"
20973,when we are married and have more occasion to know one another. I hope
20974,"upon familiarity will grow more contempt. But if you say “Marry her,” I"
20975,"will marry her. That I am freely dissolved, and dissolutely."
20976,"It is a fery discretion answer, save the fall is in the ’ord"
20977,"“dissolutely.” The ’ort is, according to our meaning, “resolutely.” His"
20978,"Ay, I think my cousin meant well."
20979,"Ay, or else I would I might be hanged, la!"
20980,Here comes fair Mistress Anne.
20981,"Here comes fair Mistress Anne.—Would I were young for your sake,"
20982,"The dinner is on the table, my father desires your worships’ company."
20983,"I will wait on him, fair Mistress Anne."
20984,’Od’s plessed will! I will not be absence at the grace.
20985,"Will’t please your worship to come in, sir?"
20986,"No, I thank you, forsooth, heartily; I am very well."
20987,"The dinner attends you, sir."
20988,"I am not a-hungry, I thank you, forsooth. [_To Simple_.] Go, sirrah,"
20989,"for all you are my man, go wait upon my cousin Shallow."
20990,A Justice of Peace sometime may be beholding to his friend for a man. I
20991,"keep but three men and a boy yet, till my mother be dead. But what"
20992,though? Yet I live like a poor gentleman born.
20993,I may not go in without your worship. They will not sit till you come.
20994,"I’ faith, I’ll eat nothing. I thank you as much as though I did."
20995,"I pray you, sir, walk in."
20996,"I had rather walk here, I thank you. I bruised my shin th’ other day"
20997,with playing at sword and dagger with a master of fence—three veneys
20998,"for a dish of stewed prunes—and, by my troth, I cannot abide the smell"
20999,of hot meat since. Why do your dogs bark so? Be there bears i’ the
21000,"I think there are, sir; I heard them talked of."
21001,"I love the sport well, but I shall as soon quarrel at it as any man in"
21002,"England. You are afraid, if you see the bear loose, are you not?"
21003,That’s meat and drink to me now. I have seen Sackerson loose twenty
21004,"times, and have taken him by the chain. But, I warrant you, the women"
21005,"have so cried and shrieked at it that it passed. But women, indeed,"
21006,cannot abide ’em; they are very ill-favoured rough things.
21007,"Come, gentle Master Slender, come. We stay for you."
21008,"I’ll eat nothing, I thank you, sir."
21009,"By cock and pie, you shall not choose, sir! Come, come."
21010,"Nay, pray you lead the way."
21011,"Mistress Anne, yourself shall go first."
21012,"Not I, sir; pray you keep on."
21013,"Truly, I will not go first; truly, la! I will not do you that wrong."
21014,"I pray you, sir."
21015,"I’ll rather be unmannerly than troublesome. You do yourself wrong,"
21016,SCENE II. The same
21017,Enter Sir Hugh Evans and Simple.
21018,"Go your ways, and ask of Doctor Caius’ house which is the way. And"
21019,"there dwells one Mistress Quickly, which is in the manner of his nurse,"
21020,"or his dry nurse, or his cook, or his laundry, his washer and his"
21021,"Nay, it is petter yet. Give her this letter. For it is a ’oman that"
21022,altogether’s acquaintance with Mistress Anne Page; and the letter is to
21023,desire and require her to solicit your master’s desires to Mistress
21024,Anne Page. I pray you be gone. I will make an end of my dinner; there’s
21025,pippins and cheese to come.
21026,SCENE III. A room in the Garter Inn
21027,"Enter Falstaff, Host, Bardolph, Nym, Pistol and Robin."
21028,Mine host of the Garter!
21029,What says my bully rook? Speak scholarly and wisely.
21030,"Truly, mine host, I must turn away some of my followers."
21031,"Discard, bully Hercules; cashier. Let them wag; trot, trot."
21032,I sit at ten pounds a week.
21033,"Thou’rt an emperor—Caesar, Keiser, and Pheazar. I will entertain"
21034,"Bardolph. He shall draw, he shall tap. Said I well, bully Hector?"
21035,"Do so, good mine host."
21036,"I have spoke, let him follow.—Let me see thee froth and lime. I am at a"
21037,"Bardolph, follow him. A tapster is a good trade. An old cloak makes a"
21038,"new jerkin; a withered servingman a fresh tapster. Go, adieu."
21039,It is a life that I have desired. I will thrive.
21040,"O base Hungarian wight, wilt thou the spigot wield?"
21041,He was gotten in drink. Is not the humour conceited?
21042,I am glad I am so acquit of this tinderbox. His thefts were too open.
21043,"His filching was like an unskilful singer, he kept not time."
21044,The good humour is to steal at a minute’s rest.
21045,"“Convey,” the wise it call. “Steal?” Foh! A _fico_ for the phrase!"
21046,"Well, sirs, I am almost out at heels."
21047,"Why, then, let kibes ensue."
21048,"There is no remedy, I must cony-catch, I must shift."
21049,Young ravens must have food.
21050,Which of you know Ford of this town?
21051,"I ken the wight, he is of substance good."
21052,"My honest lads, I will tell you what I am about."
21053,"Two yards, and more."
21054,"No quips now, Pistol. Indeed, I am in the waist two yards about, but I"
21055,"am now about no waste; I am about thrift. Briefly, I do mean to make"
21056,"love to Ford’s wife. I spy entertainment in her. She discourses, she"
21057,"carves, she gives the leer of invitation. I can construe the action of"
21058,"her familiar style; and the hardest voice of her behaviour, to be"
21059,"Englished rightly, is “I am Sir John Falstaff’s.”"
21060,He hath studied her will and translated her will—out of honesty into
21061,The anchor is deep. Will that humour pass?
21062,"Now, the report goes she has all the rule of her husband’s purse. He"
21063,hath a legion of angels.
21064,"As many devils entertain, and “To her, boy,” say I."
21065,The humour rises; it is good. Humour me the angels.
21066,"I have writ me here a letter to her; and here another to Page’s wife,"
21067,"who even now gave me good eyes too, examined my parts with most"
21068,"judicious oeillades. Sometimes the beam of her view gilded my foot,"
21069,sometimes my portly belly.
21070,Then did the sun on dunghill shine.
21071,I thank thee for that humour.
21072,"O, she did so course o’er my exteriors with such a greedy intention"
21073,that the appetite of her eye did seem to scorch me up like a
21074,burning-glass. Here’s another letter to her. She bears the purse too;
21075,"she is a region in Guiana, all gold and bounty. I will be cheaters to"
21076,"them both, and they shall be exchequers to me; they shall be my East"
21077,"and West Indies, and I will trade to them both. Go, bear thou this"
21078,letter to Mistress Page;—and thou this to Mistress Ford. We will
21079,"thrive, lads, we will thrive."
21080,"Shall I Sir Pandarus of Troy become,"
21081,And by my side wear steel? Then Lucifer take all!
21082,"I will run no base humour. Here, take the humour-letter. I will keep"
21083,the ’haviour of reputation.
21084,Sail like my pinnace to these golden shores.—
21085,"Rogues, hence, avaunt! Vanish like hailstones, go!"
21086,"Trudge, plod away o’ th’ hoof, seek shelter, pack!"
21087,Falstaff will learn the humour of this age:
21088,"French thrift, you rogues—myself and skirted page."
21089,"Let vultures gripe thy guts! For gourd and fullam holds,"
21090,And high and low beguile the rich and poor.
21091,"Tester I’ll have in pouch when thou shalt lack,"
21092,I have operations in my head which be humours of revenge.
21093,By welkin and her star!
21094,With wit or steel?
21095,"With both the humours, I."
21096,I will discuss the humour of this love to Ford.
21097,And I to Page shall eke unfold
21098,"How Falstaff, varlet vile,"
21099,"His dove will prove, his gold will hold,"
21100,And his soft couch defile.
21101,"My humour shall not cool. I will incense Ford to deal with poison, I"
21102,"will possess him with yellowness, for the revolt of mine is dangerous."
21103,That is my true humour.
21104,Thou art the Mars of malcontents. I second thee. Troop on.
21105,SCENE IV. A room in Doctor Caius’s house
21106,Enter Mistress Quickly and Simple.
21107,"I pray thee go to the casement, and see if you can see my master,"
21108,"Master Doctor Caius, coming. If he do, i’ faith, and find anybody in"
21109,"the house, here will be an old abusing of God’s patience and the King’s"
21110,"Go; and we’ll have a posset for’t soon at night, in faith, at the"
21111,latter end of a sea-coal fire.
21112,"An honest, willing, kind fellow, as ever servant shall come in house"
21113,"withal; and, I warrant you, no tell-tale nor no breed-bate. His worst"
21114,"fault is that he is given to prayer; he is something peevish that way,"
21115,but nobody but has his fault. But let that pass. Peter Simple you say
21116,"Ay, for fault of a better."
21117,And Master Slender’s your master?
21118,"Does he not wear a great round beard, like a glover’s paring-knife?"
21119,"No, forsooth, he hath but a little wee face, with a little yellow"
21120,"beard, a Cain-coloured beard."
21121,"A softly-sprighted man, is he not?"
21122,"Ay, forsooth. But he is as tall a man of his hands as any is between"
21123,this and his head. He hath fought with a warrener.
21124,"How say you? O, I should remember him. Does he not hold up his head, as"
21125,"it were, and strut in his gait?"
21126,"Yes, indeed, does he."
21127,"Well, heaven send Anne Page no worse fortune! Tell Master Parson Evans"
21128,"I will do what I can for your master. Anne is a good girl, and I wish—"
21129,"Out, alas! Here comes my master."
21130,"We shall all be shent. Run in here, good young man, go into this"
21131,closet. He will not stay long.
21132,"What, John Rugby! John! What, John, I say! Go, John, go inquire for my"
21133,"master. I doubt he be not well, that he comes not home."
21134,"Vat is you sing? I do not like dese toys. Pray you, go and vetch me in"
21135,"my closet _une boîtine verte_, a box, a green-a box. Do intend vat I"
21136,speak? A green-a box.
21137,"Ay, forsooth, I’ll fetch it you."
21138,"man, he would have been horn-mad."
21139,"_Fe, fe, fe fe! Ma foi, il fait fort chaud. Je m’en vais à la cour—la"
21140,"Is it this, sir?"
21141,"_Oui, mette-le au mon_ pocket. _Dépêche_, quickly—Vere is dat knave"
21142,"What, John Rugby, John!"
21143,"You are John Rugby, and you are Jack Rugby. Come, take-a your rapier,"
21144,and come after my heel to the court.
21145,"’Tis ready, sir, here in the porch."
21146,"By my trot, I tarry too long. ’Od’s me! _Qu’ay j’oublié?_ Dere is some"
21147,simples in my closet dat I vill not for the varld I shall leave behind.
21148,"Ay me, he’ll find the young man there, and be mad!"
21149,"_O diable, diable!_ Vat is in my closet? Villainy! _Larron!_ [_Pulling"
21150,"Simple out_.] Rugby, my rapier!"
21151,"Good master, be content."
21152,Wherefore shall I be content-a?
21153,The young man is an honest man.
21154,What shall de honest man do in my closet? Dere is no honest man dat
21155,shall come in my closet.
21156,"I beseech you, be not so phlegmatic. Hear the truth of it. He came of"
21157,an errand to me from Parson Hugh.
21158,"Ay, forsooth, to desire her to—"
21159,"Peace, I pray you."
21160,Peace-a your tongue!—Speak-a your tale.
21161,"To desire this honest gentlewoman, your maid, to speak a good word to"
21162,Mistress Anne Page for my master in the way of marriage.
21163,"This is all, indeed, la! But I’ll ne’er put my finger in the fire, and"
21164,"Sir Hugh send-a you?—Rugby, _baille_ me some paper.—Tarry you a"
21165,"moved, you should have heard him so loud and so melancholy. But"
21166,"notwithstanding, man, I’ll do you your master what good I can; and the"
21167,"very yea and the no is, the French doctor, my master—I may call him my"
21168,"master, look you, for I keep his house, and I wash, wring, brew, bake,"
21169,"scour, dress meat and drink, make the beds, and do all myself—"
21170,"charge, and to be up early and down late; but notwithstanding—to tell"
21171,"you in your ear, I would have no words of it—my master himself is in"
21172,"love with Mistress Anne Page; but notwithstanding that, I know Anne’s"
21173,mind. That’s neither here nor there.
21174,"You jack’nape, give-a dis letter to Sir Hugh. By gar, it is a"
21175,"shallenge. I will cut his troat in de park, and I will teach a scurvy"
21176,"jackanape priest to meddle or make. You may be gone, it is not good you"
21177,"tarry here.—By gar, I will cut all his two stones. By gar, he shall not"
21178,have a stone to throw at his dog.
21179,"Alas, he speaks but for his friend."
21180,It is no matter-a ver dat. Do not you tell-a me dat I shall have Anne
21181,"Page for myself? By gar, I vill kill de Jack priest; and I have"
21182,"appointed mine host of de Jarteer to measure our weapon. By gar, I will"
21183,myself have Anne Page.
21184,"Sir, the maid loves you, and all shall be well. We must give folks"
21185,"leave to prate. What, the good-year!"
21186,"Rugby, come to the court with me. [_To Mistress Quickly_.] By gar, if I"
21187,"have not Anne Page, I shall turn your head out of my door.—Follow my"
21188,"You shall have An—fool’s head of your own. No, I know Anne’s mind for"
21189,"that. Never a woman in Windsor knows more of Anne’s mind than I do, nor"
21190,"can do more than I do with her, I thank heaven."
21191,"Who’s there, I trow? Come near the house, I pray you."
21192,"How now, good woman? How dost thou?"
21193,"The better, that it pleases your good worship to ask."
21194,What news? How does pretty Mistress Anne?
21195,"In truth, sir, and she is pretty, and honest, and gentle; and one that"
21196,"is your friend, I can tell you that by the way, I praise heaven for it."
21197,"Shall I do any good, think’st thou? Shall I not lose my suit?"
21198,"Troth, sir, all is in His hands above. But notwithstanding, Master"
21199,"Fenton, I’ll be sworn on a book she loves you. Have not your worship a"
21200,wart above your eye?
21201,"Yes, marry, have I; what of that?"
21202,"Well, thereby hangs a tale. Good faith, it is such another Nan! But, I"
21203,"detest, an honest maid as ever broke bread. We had an hour’s talk of"
21204,"that wart. I shall never laugh but in that maid’s company. But, indeed,"
21205,"she is given too much to allicholy and musing. But for you—well, go to."
21206,"Well, I shall see her today. Hold, there’s money for thee. Let me have"
21207,"thy voice in my behalf. If thou seest her before me, commend me."
21208,"Will I? I’ faith, that we will! And I will tell your worship more of"
21209,"the wart the next time we have confidence, and of other wooers."
21210,"Well, farewell, I am in great haste now."
21211,Farewell to your worship.
21212,"Truly, an honest gentleman—but Anne loves him not, for I know Anne’s"
21213,"mind as well as another does. Out upon ’t, what have I forgot?"
21214,SCENE I. Before Page’s house
21215,Enter Mistress Page reading a letter.
21216,"What, have I scaped love-letters in the holiday-time of my beauty, and"
21217,am I now a subject for them? Let me see.
21218,"for his precisian, he admits him not for his counsellor. You are not"
21219,"young, no more am I. Go to, then, there’s sympathy. You are merry, so"
21220,"am I. Ha, ha, then there’s more sympathy. You love sack, and so do I."
21221,"Would you desire better sympathy? Let it suffice thee, Mistress Page,"
21222,"at the least, if the love of soldier can suffice, that I love thee. I"
21223,"will not say, pity me—’tis not a soldier-like phrase—but I say love me."
21224,"Thine own true knight,"
21225,"By day or night,"
21226,"Or any kind of light,"
21227,"With all his might,"
21228,"For thee to fight,"
21229,"What a Herod of Jewry is this! O wicked, wicked world! One that is"
21230,"well-nigh worn to pieces with age, to show himself a young gallant!"
21231,What an unweighed behaviour hath this Flemish drunkard picked—with the
21232,"devil’s name!—out of my conversation, that he dares in this manner"
21233,"assay me? Why, he hath not been thrice in my company! What should I say"
21234,"to him? I was then frugal of my mirth. Heaven forgive me! Why, I’ll"
21235,exhibit a bill in the parliament for the putting down of men. How shall
21236,"I be revenged on him? For revenged I will be, as sure as his guts are"
21237,"Mistress Page! Trust me, I was going to your house."
21238,"And, trust me, I was coming to you. You look very ill."
21239,"Nay, I’ll ne’er believe that. I have to show to the contrary."
21240,"Faith, but you do, in my mind."
21241,"Well, I do, then. Yet I say I could show you to the contrary. O,"
21242,"Mistress Page, give me some counsel."
21243,"What’s the matter, woman?"
21244,"O woman, if it were not for one trifling respect, I could come to such"
21245,"Hang the trifle, woman; take the honour. What is it? Dispense with"
21246,trifles. What is it?
21247,"If I would but go to hell for an eternal moment or so, I could be"
21248,"What? Thou liest! Sir Alice Ford! These knights will hack, and so thou"
21249,shouldst not alter the article of thy gentry.
21250,"We burn daylight. Here, read, read. Perceive how I might be knighted. I"
21251,shall think the worse of fat men as long as I have an eye to make
21252,difference of men’s liking. And yet he would not swear; praised women’s
21253,modesty; and gave such orderly and well-behaved reproof to all
21254,uncomeliness that I would have sworn his disposition would have gone to
21255,the truth of his words. But they do no more adhere and keep place
21256,together than the Hundredth Psalm to the tune of “Greensleeves.” What
21257,"tempest, I trow, threw this whale, with so many tuns of oil in his"
21258,"belly, ashore at Windsor? How shall I be revenged on him? I think the"
21259,"best way were to entertain him with hope, till the wicked fire of lust"
21260,have melted him in his own grease. Did you ever hear the like?
21261,"Letter for letter, but that the name of Page and Ford differs! To thy"
21262,"great comfort in this mystery of ill opinions, here’s the twin brother"
21263,"of thy letter. But let thine inherit first, for I protest mine never"
21264,"shall. I warrant he hath a thousand of these letters, writ with blank"
21265,"space for different names—sure, more, and these are of the second"
21266,"edition. He will print them, out of doubt; for he cares not what he"
21267,"puts into the press, when he would put us two. I had rather be a"
21268,"giantess and lie under Mount Pelion. Well, I will find you twenty"
21269,lascivious turtles ere one chaste man.
21270,"Why, this is the very same—the very hand, the very words. What doth he"
21271,"Nay, I know not. It makes me almost ready to wrangle with mine own"
21272,honesty. I’ll entertain myself like one that I am not acquainted
21273,"withal; for, sure, unless he know some strain in me that I know not"
21274,"myself, he would never have boarded me in this fury."
21275,“Boarding” call you it? I’ll be sure to keep him above deck.
21276,"So will I. If he come under my hatches, I’ll never to sea again. Let’s"
21277,"be revenged on him. Let’s appoint him a meeting, give him a show of"
21278,"comfort in his suit, and lead him on with a fine-baited delay, till he"
21279,hath pawned his horses to mine host of the Garter.
21280,"Nay, I will consent to act any villainy against him that may not sully"
21281,"the chariness of our honesty. O, that my husband saw this letter! It"
21282,would give eternal food to his jealousy.
21283,"Why, look where he comes; and my good man too. He’s as far from"
21284,"jealousy as I am from giving him cause, and that, I hope, is an"
21285,You are the happier woman.
21286,Let’s consult together against this greasy knight. Come hither.
21287,"Enter Ford with Pistol, and Page with Nym."
21288,"Well, I hope it be not so."
21289,Hope is a curtal dog in some affairs.
21290,Sir John affects thy wife.
21291,"Why, sir, my wife is not young."
21292,"He woos both high and low, both rich and poor,"
21293,"Both young and old, one with another, Ford."
21294,"He loves the gallimaufry. Ford, perpend."
21295,With liver burning hot.
21296,"Prevent, or go thou like Sir Actaeon he,"
21297,With Ringwood at thy heels.
21298,"O, odious is the name!"
21299,"The horn, I say. Farewell."
21300,"Take heed, have open eye, for thieves do foot by night."
21301,"Take heed, ere summer comes, or cuckoo birds do sing.—"
21302,"Away, Sir Corporal Nym.—Believe it, Page, he speaks sense."
21303,wronged me in some humours. I should have borne the humoured letter to
21304,"her; but I have a sword, and it shall bite upon my necessity. He loves"
21305,your wife; there’s the short and the long. My name is Corporal Nym. I
21306,"speak, and I avouch ’tis true. My name is Nym, and Falstaff loves your"
21307,wife. Adieu. I love not the humour of bread and cheese. Adieu.
21308,English out of his wits.
21309,town commended him for a true man.
21310,Mistress Page and Mistress Ford come forward.
21311,"Whither go you, George? Hark you."
21312,"How now, sweet Frank, why art thou melancholy?"
21313,"I melancholy? I am not melancholy. Get you home, go."
21314,"Faith, thou hast some crotchets in thy head now.—Will you go, Mistress"
21315,"Have with you. You’ll come to dinner, George?"
21316,messenger to this paltry knight.
21317,You are come to see my daughter Anne?
21318,"Ay, forsooth. And, I pray, how does good Mistress Anne?"
21319,Go in with us and see. We’d have an hour’s talk with you.
21320,"How now, Master Ford?"
21321,"You heard what this knave told me, did you not?"
21322,"Yes, and you heard what the other told me?"
21323,Do you think there is truth in them?
21324,"Hang ’em, slaves! I do not think the knight would offer it, but these"
21325,that accuse him in his intent towards our wives are a yoke of his
21326,"discarded men, very rogues, now they be out of service."
21327,Were they his men?
21328,I like it never the better for that. Does he lie at the Garter?
21329,"Ay, marry, does he. If he should intend this voyage toward my wife, I"
21330,would turn her loose to him; and what he gets more of her than sharp
21331,"words, let it lie on my head."
21332,"I do not misdoubt my wife, but I would be loath to turn them together."
21333,A man may be too confident. I would have nothing lie on my head. I
21334,cannot be thus satisfied.
21335,Look where my ranting host of the Garter comes. There is either liquor
21336,"in his pate or money in his purse when he looks so merrily.—How now,"
21337,"How now, bully rook? Thou’rt a gentleman.—Cavaliero Justice, I say!"
21338,"I follow, mine host, I follow.—Good even and twenty, good Master Page."
21339,"Master Page, will you go with us? We have sport in hand."
21340,"Tell him, Cavaliero Justice; tell him, bully rook."
21341,"Sir, there is a fray to be fought between Sir Hugh the Welsh priest and"
21342,Caius the French doctor.
21343,"Good mine host o’ the Garter, a word with you."
21344,"What say’st thou, my bully rook?"
21345,"the measuring of their weapons, and, I think, hath appointed them"
21346,"contrary places; for, believe me, I hear the parson is no jester. Hark,"
21347,I will tell you what our sport shall be.
21348,"Hast thou no suit against my knight, my guest cavaliero?"
21349,"None, I protest. But I’ll give you a pottle of burnt sack to give me"
21350,"recourse to him, and tell him my name is Brook, only for a jest."
21351,"My hand, bully. Thou shalt have egress and regress—said I well?—and thy"
21352,"name shall be Brook. It is a merry knight. Will you go, myn-heers?"
21353,"Have with you, mine host."
21354,I have heard the Frenchman hath good skill in his rapier.
21355,"Tut, sir, I could have told you more. In these times you stand on"
21356,"distance—your passes, stoccadoes, and I know not what. ’Tis the heart,"
21357,"Master Page; ’tis here, ’tis here. I have seen the time, with my long"
21358,sword I would have made you four tall fellows skip like rats.
21359,"Here, boys, here, here! Shall we wag?"
21360,Have with you. I had rather hear them scold than fight.
21361,"Though Page be a secure fool, and stands so firmly on his wife’s"
21362,"frailty, yet I cannot put off my opinion so easily. She was in his"
21363,"company at Page’s house, and what they made there I know not. Well, I"
21364,"will look further into ’t, and I have a disguise to sound Falstaff. If"
21365,"I find her honest, I lose not my labour. If she be otherwise, ’tis"
21366,SCENE II. A room in the Garter Inn
21367,Enter Falstaff and Pistol.
21368,I will not lend thee a penny.
21369,"Why then, the world’s mine oyster,"
21370,Which I with sword will open.
21371,"Not a penny. I have been content, sir, you should lay my countenance to"
21372,pawn; I have grated upon my good friends for three reprieves for you
21373,"and your coach-fellow Nym, or else you had looked through the grate"
21374,like a gemini of baboons. I am damned in hell for swearing to gentlemen
21375,my friends you were good soldiers and tall fellows. And when Mistress
21376,"Bridget lost the handle of her fan, I took ’t upon mine honour thou"
21377,Didst not thou share? Hadst thou not fifteen pence?
21378,"Reason, you rogue, reason. Think’st thou I’ll endanger my soul gratis?"
21379,"At a word, hang no more about me, I am no gibbet for you. Go—a short"
21380,"knife and a throng—to your manor of Pickt-hatch, go. You’ll not bear a"
21381,"letter for me, you rogue? You stand upon your honour! Why, thou"
21382,"unconfinable baseness, it is as much as I can do to keep the terms of"
21383,"my honour precise. Ay, ay, I myself sometimes, leaving the fear of God"
21384,"on the left hand, and hiding mine honour in my necessity, am fain to"
21385,"shuffle, to hedge, and to lurch; and yet you, rogue, will ensconce your"
21386,"rags, your cat-a-mountain looks, your red-lattice phrases, and your"
21387,"bold beating oaths, under the shelter of your honour! You will not do"
21388,I do relent. What wouldst thou more of man?
21389,"Sir, here’s a woman would speak with you."
21390,Give your worship good morrow.
21391,"Not so, an’t please your worship."
21392,"I’ll be sworn, as my mother was, the first hour I was born."
21393,I do believe the swearer. What with me?
21394,Shall I vouchsafe your worship a word or two?
21395,"Two thousand, fair woman; and I’ll vouchsafe thee the hearing."
21396,"There is one Mistress Ford, sir—I pray, come a little nearer this ways."
21397,I myself dwell with Master Doctor Caius.
21398,"Well, on; Mistress Ford, you say—"
21399,Your worship says very true. I pray your worship come a little nearer
21400,"I warrant thee, nobody hears. Mine own people, mine own people."
21401,"Are they so? God bless them, and make them His servants!"
21402,"Well, Mistress Ford, what of her?"
21403,"Why, sir, she’s a good creature. Lord, Lord, your worship’s a wanton!"
21404,"Well, heaven forgive you, and all of us, I pray!"
21405,"Mistress Ford, come, Mistress Ford."
21406,"Marry, this is the short and the long of it: you have brought her into"
21407,"such a canaries as ’tis wonderful. The best courtier of them all, when"
21408,"the court lay at Windsor, could never have brought her to such a"
21409,"canary. Yet there has been knights, and lords, and gentlemen, with"
21410,"their coaches, I warrant you, coach after coach, letter after letter,"
21411,"gift after gift, smelling so sweetly, all musk, and so rushling, I"
21412,"warrant you, in silk and gold, and in such alligant terms, and in such"
21413,"wine and sugar of the best and the fairest, that would have won any"
21414,"woman’s heart; and I warrant you, they could never get an eye-wink of"
21415,"her. I had myself twenty angels given me this morning, but I defy all"
21416,"angels in any such sort, as they say, but in the way of honesty. And, I"
21417,"warrant you, they could never get her so much as sip on a cup with the"
21418,"proudest of them all. And yet there has been earls—nay, which is more,"
21419,"pensioners—but, I warrant you, all is one with her."
21420,"But what says she to me? Be brief, my good she-Mercury."
21421,"Marry, she hath received your letter, for the which she thanks you a"
21422,thousand times; and she gives you to notify that her husband will be
21423,absence from his house between ten and eleven.
21424,"Ay, forsooth; and then you may come and see the picture, she says, that"
21425,"you wot of. Master Ford, her husband, will be from home. Alas, the"
21426,sweet woman leads an ill life with him. He’s a very jealousy man; she
21427,"leads a very frampold life with him, good heart."
21428,"Ten and eleven. Woman, commend me to her; I will not fail her."
21429,"Why, you say well. But I have another messenger to your worship."
21430,Mistress Page hath her hearty commendations to you too; and let me tell
21431,"you in your ear, she’s as fartuous a civil modest wife, and one, I tell"
21432,"you, that will not miss you morning nor evening prayer, as any is in"
21433,"Windsor, whoe’er be the other; and she bade me tell your worship that"
21434,"her husband is seldom from home, but she hopes there will come a time."
21435,I never knew a woman so dote upon a man. Surely I think you have
21436,"charms, la! Yes, in truth."
21437,"Not I, I assure thee. Setting the attraction of my good parts aside, I"
21438,have no other charms.
21439,Blessing on your heart for ’t!
21440,"But, I pray thee, tell me this: has Ford’s wife and Page’s wife"
21441,acquainted each other how they love me?
21442,"That were a jest indeed! They have not so little grace, I hope. That"
21443,were a trick indeed! But Mistress Page would desire you to send her
21444,"your little page, of all loves. Her husband has a marvellous infection"
21445,"to the little page; and, truly, Master Page is an honest man. Never a"
21446,"wife in Windsor leads a better life than she does. Do what she will,"
21447,"say what she will, take all, pay all, go to bed when she list, rise"
21448,"when she list, all is as she will, and truly she deserves it, for if"
21449,"there be a kind woman in Windsor, she is one. You must send her your"
21450,"Nay, but do so then, and, look you, he may come and go between you"
21451,"both; and in any case have a nay-word, that you may know one another’s"
21452,"mind, and the boy never need to understand anything; for ’tis not good"
21453,"that children should know any wickedness. Old folks, you know, have"
21454,"discretion, as they say, and know the world."
21455,"Fare thee well, commend me to them both. There’s my purse; I am yet thy"
21456,"debtor. Boy, go along with this woman.—This news distracts me."
21457,This punk is one of Cupid’s carriers;
21458,"Clap on more sails, pursue; up with your fights;"
21459,"Give fire! She is my prize, or ocean whelm them all!"
21460,"Sayst thou so, old Jack? Go thy ways, I’ll make more of thy old body"
21461,"than I have done. Will they yet look after thee? Wilt thou, after the"
21462,"expense of so much money, be now a gainer? Good body, I thank thee. Let"
21463,"them say ’tis grossly done; so it be fairly done, no matter."
21464,Enter Bardolph with a cup of sack.
21465,"Sir John, there’s one Master Brook below would fain speak with you and"
21466,"be acquainted with you, and hath sent your worship a morning’s draught"
21467,Brook is his name?
21468,"Such Brooks are welcome to me, that o’erflow such liquor. Ah, ha,"
21469,"Mistress Ford and Mistress Page, have I encompassed you? Go to, _via!_"
21470,Enter Bardolph with Ford disguised as Brook.
21471,"God bless you, sir."
21472,"And you, sir. Would you speak with me?"
21473,I make bold to press with so little preparation upon you.
21474,"You’re welcome. What’s your will?—Give us leave, drawer."
21475,"Sir, I am a gentleman that have spent much. My name is Brook."
21476,"Good Master Brook, I desire more acquaintance of you."
21477,"Good Sir John, I sue for yours; not to charge you, for I must let you"
21478,"understand I think myself in better plight for a lender than you are,"
21479,the which hath something emboldened me to this unseasoned intrusion;
21480,"for they say, if money go before, all ways do lie open."
21481,"Money is a good soldier, sir, and will on."
21482,"Troth, and I have a bag of money here troubles me. If you will help to"
21483,"bear it, Sir John, take all, or half, for easing me of the carriage."
21484,"Sir, I know not how I may deserve to be your porter."
21485,"I will tell you, sir, if you will give me the hearing."
21486,"Speak, good Master Brook. I shall be glad to be your servant."
21487,"Sir, I hear you are a scholar—I will be brief with you—and you have"
21488,"been a man long known to me, though I had never so good means as desire"
21489,"to make myself acquainted with you. I shall discover a thing to you,"
21490,"wherein I must very much lay open mine own imperfection. But, good Sir"
21491,"John, as you have one eye upon my follies, as you hear them unfolded,"
21492,"turn another into the register of your own, that I may pass with a"
21493,"reproof the easier, sith you yourself know how easy it is to be such an"
21494,"Very well, sir, proceed."
21495,"There is a gentlewoman in this town, her husband’s name is Ford."
21496,"I have long loved her, and, I protest to you, bestowed much on her,"
21497,"followed her with a doting observance, engrossed opportunities to meet"
21498,"her, fee’d every slight occasion that could but niggardly give me sight"
21499,"of her, not only bought many presents to give her, but have given"
21500,"largely to many to know what she would have given. Briefly, I have"
21501,"pursued her as love hath pursued me, which hath been on the wing of all"
21502,"occasions. But whatsoever I have merited, either in my mind or in my"
21503,"means, meed, I am sure, I have received none, unless experience be a"
21504,"jewel. That I have purchased at an infinite rate, and that hath taught"
21505,me to say this:
21506,"Love like a shadow flies when substance love pursues,"
21507,"Pursuing that that flies, and flying what pursues."
21508,Have you received no promise of satisfaction at her hands?
21509,Have you importuned her to such a purpose?
21510,"Of what quality was your love, then?"
21511,"Like a fair house built on another man’s ground, so that I have lost my"
21512,edifice by mistaking the place where I erected it.
21513,To what purpose have you unfolded this to me?
21514,"When I have told you that, I have told you all. Some say that though"
21515,"she appear honest to me, yet in other places she enlargeth her mirth so"
21516,"far that there is shrewd construction made of her. Now, Sir John, here"
21517,"is the heart of my purpose: you are a gentleman of excellent breeding,"
21518,"admirable discourse, of great admittance, authentic in your place and"
21519,"person, generally allowed for your many warlike, courtlike, and learned"
21520,"Believe it, for you know it. There is money. Spend it, spend it; spend"
21521,more; spend all I have; only give me so much of your time in exchange
21522,of it as to lay an amiable siege to the honesty of this Ford’s wife.
21523,"Use your art of wooing, win her to consent to you. If any man may, you"
21524,may as soon as any.
21525,Would it apply well to the vehemency of your affection that I should
21526,win what you would enjoy? Methinks you prescribe to yourself very
21527,"O, understand my drift. She dwells so securely on the excellency of her"
21528,honour that the folly of my soul dares not present itself; she is too
21529,"bright to be looked against. Now, could I come to her with any"
21530,"detection in my hand, my desires had instance and argument to commend"
21531,"themselves. I could drive her then from the ward of her purity, her"
21532,"reputation, her marriage vow, and a thousand other her defences, which"
21533,"now are too too strongly embattled against me. What say you to’t, Sir"
21534,"Master Brook, I will first make bold with your money; next, give me"
21535,"your hand; and last, as I am a gentleman, you shall, if you will, enjoy"
21536,I say you shall.
21537,"Want no money, Sir John; you shall want none."
21538,"Want no Mistress Ford, Master Brook; you shall want none. I shall be"
21539,"with her, I may tell you, by her own appointment; even as you came in"
21540,"to me, her assistant or go-between parted from me. I say I shall be"
21541,"with her between ten and eleven, for at that time the jealous rascally"
21542,knave her husband will be forth. Come you to me at night. You shall
21543,know how I speed.
21544,"I am blessed in your acquaintance. Do you know Ford, sir?"
21545,"Hang him, poor cuckoldly knave! I know him not. Yet I wrong him to call"
21546,"him poor. They say the jealous wittolly knave hath masses of money, for"
21547,the which his wife seems to me well-favoured. I will use her as the key
21548,"of the cuckoldly rogue’s coffer, and there’s my harvest-home."
21549,"I would you knew Ford, sir, that you might avoid him if you saw him."
21550,"Hang him, mechanical salt-butter rogue! I will stare him out of his"
21551,"wits, I will awe him with my cudgel; it shall hang like a meteor o’er"
21552,"the cuckold’s horns. Master Brook, thou shalt know I will predominate"
21553,"over the peasant, and thou shalt lie with his wife. Come to me soon at"
21554,"night. Ford’s a knave, and I will aggravate his style. Thou, Master"
21555,"Brook, shalt know him for knave and cuckold. Come to me soon at night."
21556,What a damned epicurean rascal is this! My heart is ready to crack with
21557,impatience. Who says this is improvident jealousy? My wife hath sent to
21558,"him, the hour is fixed, the match is made. Would any man have thought"
21559,"this? See the hell of having a false woman: my bed shall be abused, my"
21560,"coffers ransacked, my reputation gnawn at; and I shall not only receive"
21561,"this villanous wrong, but stand under the adoption of abominable terms,"
21562,"and by him that does me this wrong. Terms, names! Amaimon sounds well;"
21563,"Lucifer, well; Barbason, well; yet they are devils’ additions, the"
21564,names of fiends. But cuckold? Wittol? Cuckold? The devil himself hath
21565,"not such a name. Page is an ass, a secure ass; he will trust his wife,"
21566,"he will not be jealous. I will rather trust a Fleming with my butter,"
21567,"Parson Hugh the Welshman with my cheese, an Irishman with my aqua-vitae"
21568,"bottle, or a thief to walk my ambling gelding, than my wife with"
21569,"herself. Then she plots, then she ruminates, then she devises; and what"
21570,"they think in their hearts they may effect, they will break their"
21571,hearts but they will effect. God be praised for my jealousy! Eleven
21572,"o’clock the hour. I will prevent this, detect my wife, be revenged on"
21573,"Falstaff, and laugh at Page. I will about it. Better three hours too"
21574,"soon than a minute too late. Fie, fie, fie! Cuckold, cuckold, cuckold!"
21575,SCENE III. A field near Windsor
21576,Enter Doctor Caius and Rugby.
21577,"Vat is de clock, Jack?"
21578,"’Tis past the hour, sir, that Sir Hugh promised to meet."
21579,"By gar, he has save his soul, dat he is no come. He has pray his Pible"
21580,"well dat he is no come. By gar, Jack Rugby, he is dead already, if he"
21581,"He is wise, sir; he knew your worship would kill him if he came."
21582,"By gar, de herring is no dead so as I vill kill him. Take your rapier,"
21583,Jack; I vill tell you how I vill kill him.
21584,"Alas, sir, I cannot fence."
21585,"Villainy, take your rapier."
21586,"Enter Page, Shallow, Slender and Host."
21587,"God bless thee, bully doctor!"
21588,"God save you, Master Doctor Caius!"
21589,"Now, good Master Doctor!"
21590,"Give you good morrow, sir."
21591,"Vat be all you, one, two, tree, four, come for?"
21592,"To see thee fight, to see thee foin, to see thee traverse; to see thee"
21593,"here, to see thee there; to see thee pass thy punto, thy stock, thy"
21594,"reverse, thy distance, thy montant. Is he dead, my Ethiopian? Is he"
21595,"dead, my Francisco? Ha, bully? What says my Aesculapius, my Galen, my"
21596,"heart of elder, ha? Is he dead, bully stale? Is he dead?"
21597,"By gar, he is de coward Jack-priest of de vorld. He is not show his"
21598,"Thou art a Castalion King Urinal Hector of Greece, my boy!"
21599,"I pray you, bear witness that me have stay six or seven, two, tree"
21600,"hours for him, and he is no come."
21601,"He is the wiser man, Master doctor. He is a curer of souls, and you a"
21602,"curer of bodies. If you should fight, you go against the hair of your"
21603,"professions. Is it not true, Master Page?"
21604,"Master Shallow, you have yourself been a great fighter, though now a"
21605,"Bodykins, Master Page, though I now be old, and of the peace, if I see"
21606,"a sword out, my finger itches to make one. Though we are justices and"
21607,"doctors and churchmen, Master Page, we have some salt of our youth in"
21608,"us. We are the sons of women, Master Page."
21609,"’Tis true, Master Shallow."
21610,"It will be found so, Master Page.—Master Doctor Caius, I come to fetch"
21611,you home. I am sworn of the peace. You have showed yourself a wise
21612,"physician, and Sir Hugh hath shown himself a wise and patient"
21613,"churchman. You must go with me, Master Doctor."
21614,"Pardon, guest justice.—A word, Monsieur Mockwater."
21615,Mockvater? Vat is dat?
21616,"Mockwater, in our English tongue, is valour, bully."
21617,"By gar, then I have as much mockvater as de Englishman. Scurvy jack-dog"
21618,"priest! By gar, me vill cut his ears."
21619,"He will clapper-claw thee tightly, bully."
21620,Clapper-de-claw? Vat is dat?
21621,"That is, he will make thee amends."
21622,"By gar, me do look he shall clapper-de-claw me, for, by gar, me vill"
21623,"And I will provoke him to’t, or let him wag."
21624,Me tank you for dat.
21625,"And, moreover, bully—but first, Master guest, and Master Page, and eke"
21626,"Cavaliero Slender, go you through the town to Frogmore."
21627,bring the doctor about by the fields. Will it do well?
21628,"PAGE, SHALLOW and SLENDER"
21629,"Adieu, good Master Doctor."
21630,"By gar, me vill kill de priest, for he speak for a jackanape to Anne"
21631,Let him die. Sheathe thy impatience; throw cold water on thy choler. Go
21632,about the fields with me through Frogmore. I will bring thee where
21633,"Mistress Anne Page is, at a farm-house a-feasting, and thou shalt woo"
21634,her. Cried game! Said I well?
21635,"By gar, me tank you for dat. By gar, I love you; and I shall procure-a"
21636,"you de good guest: de earl, de knight, de lords, de gentlemen, my"
21637,For the which I will be thy adversary toward Anne Page. Said I well?
21638,"By gar, ’tis good; vell said."
21639,"Let us wag, then."
21640,"Come at my heels, Jack Rugby."
21641,SCENE I. A field near Frogmore
21642,Enter Sir Hugh Evans and Simple.
21643,"I pray you now, good Master Slender’s servingman, and friend Simple by"
21644,"your name, which way have you looked for Master Caius, that calls"
21645,himself doctor of physic?
21646,"Marry, sir, the Petty-ward, the Park-ward, every way; old Windsor way,"
21647,and every way but the town way.
21648,"I most fehemently desire you, you will also look that way."
21649,"Pless my soul, how full of cholers I am, and trempling of mind! I shall"
21650,be glad if he have deceived me. How melancholies I am! I will knog his
21651,urinals about his knave’s costard when I have good opportunities for
21652,the ’ork. Pless my soul!
21653,"_To shallow rivers, to whose falls"
21654,Melodious birds sings madrigals.
21655,There will we make our peds of roses
21656,And a thousand fragrant posies.
21657,"Mercy on me, I have a great dispositions to cry."
21658,_Melodious birds sing madrigals—
21659,Whenas I sat in Pabylon—
21660,And a thousand vagram posies.
21661,"To shallow rivers, to whose falls"
21662,Melodious birds sing madrigals._
21663,"Yonder he is, coming this way, Sir Hugh."
21664,Heaven prosper the right! What weapons is he?
21665,"No weapons, sir. There comes my master, Master Shallow, and another"
21666,"gentleman, from Frogmore, over the stile, this way."
21667,"Pray you, give me my gown—or else keep it in your arms."
21668,"Enter Page, Shallow and Slender."
21669,"How now, Master Parson? Good morrow, good Sir Hugh. Keep a gamester"
21670,"from the dice, and a good student from his book, and it is wonderful."
21671,"God save you, good Sir Hugh!"
21672,"God pless you from his mercy sake, all of you!"
21673,"What, the sword and the word? Do you study them both, Master Parson?"
21674,"And youthful still—in your doublet and hose, this raw rheumatic day?"
21675,There is reasons and causes for it.
21676,"We are come to you to do a good office, Master Parson."
21677,Fery well; what is it?
21678,"Yonder is a most reverend gentleman who, belike having received wrong"
21679,"by some person, is at most odds with his own gravity and patience that"
21680,I have lived fourscore years and upward; I never heard a man of his
21681,"place, gravity, and learning, so wide of his own respect."
21682,"I think you know him: Master Doctor Caius, the renowned French"
21683,Got’s will and His passion of my heart! I had as lief you would tell me
21684,of a mess of porridge.
21685,"He has no more knowledge in Hibbocrates and Galen, and he is a knave"
21686,"besides, a cowardly knave as you would desires to be acquainted withal."
21687,"I warrant you, he’s the man should fight with him."
21688,It appears so by his weapons. Keep them asunder. Here comes Doctor
21689,"Enter Host, Caius and Rugby."
21690,"Nay, good Master Parson, keep in your weapon."
21691,"So do you, good Master Doctor."
21692,"Disarm them, and let them question. Let them keep their limbs whole and"
21693,"I pray you, let-a me speak a word with your ear. Verefore will you not"
21694,"By gar, you are de coward, de Jack dog, John ape."
21695,"men’s humours. I desire you in friendship, and I will one way or other"
21696,"_Diable!_ Jack Rugby, mine Host de Jarteer, have I not stay for him to"
21697,"kill him? Have I not, at de place I did appoint?"
21698,"As I am a Christians soul, now look you, this is the place appointed."
21699,I’ll be judgment by mine host of the Garter.
21700,"Peace, I say, Gallia and Gaul, French and Welsh, soul-curer and"
21701,"Ay, dat is very good; excellent."
21702,"Peace, I say! Hear mine host of the Garter. Am I politic? Am I subtle?"
21703,"Am I a Machiavel? Shall I lose my doctor? No, he gives me the potions"
21704,"and the motions. Shall I lose my parson, my priest, my Sir Hugh? No, he"
21705,"gives me the proverbs and the no-verbs. [_To Caius_.] Give me thy hand,"
21706,"terrestrial; so. [_To Evans_.] Give me thy hand, celestial; so. Boys of"
21707,"art, I have deceived you both. I have directed you to wrong places."
21708,"Your hearts are mighty, your skins are whole, and let burnt sack be the"
21709,"issue. Come, lay their swords to pawn. Follow me, lads of peace,"
21710,"Afore God, a mad host! Follow, gentlemen, follow."
21711,"Ha, do I perceive dat? Have you make-a de sot of us, ha, ha?"
21712,"This is well, he has made us his vlouting-stog. I desire you that we"
21713,"may be friends, and let us knog our prains together to be revenge on"
21714,"this same scall, scurvy, cogging companion, the host of the Garter."
21715,"By gar, with all my heart. He promise to bring me where is Anne Page;"
21716,"by gar, he deceive me too."
21717,"Well, I will smite his noddles. Pray you follow."
21718,SCENE II. A street in Windsor
21719,Enter Mistress Page following Robin.
21720,"Nay, keep your way, little gallant. You were wont to be a follower, but"
21721,"now you are a leader. Whether had you rather, lead mine eyes, or eye"
21722,"I had rather, forsooth, go before you like a man than follow him like a"
21723,"O, you are a flattering boy! Now I see you’ll be a courtier."
21724,"Well met, Mistress Page. Whither go you?"
21725,"Truly, sir, to see your wife. Is she at home?"
21726,"Ay, and as idle as she may hang together, for want of company. I think"
21727,if your husbands were dead you two would marry.
21728,Be sure of that—two other husbands.
21729,Where had you this pretty weathercock?
21730,I cannot tell what the dickens his name is my husband had him of. What
21731,"do you call your knight’s name, sirrah?"
21732,"He, he; I can never hit on’s name. There is such a league between my"
21733,good man and he! Is your wife at home indeed?
21734,"By your leave, sir, I am sick till I see her."
21735,"Has Page any brains? Hath he any eyes? Hath he any thinking? Sure, they"
21736,"sleep; he hath no use of them. Why, this boy will carry a letter twenty"
21737,mile as easy as a cannon will shoot point-blank twelve score. He pieces
21738,"out his wife’s inclination, he gives her folly motion and advantage."
21739,"And now she’s going to my wife, and Falstaff’s boy with her. A man may"
21740,hear this shower sing in the wind. And Falstaff’s boy with her! Good
21741,"plots they are laid, and our revolted wives share damnation together."
21742,"Well, I will take him, then torture my wife, pluck the borrowed veil of"
21743,"modesty from the so-seeming Mistress Page, divulge Page himself for a"
21744,"secure and wilful Actaeon, and to these violent proceedings all my"
21745,"neighbours shall cry aim. [_Clock strikes_.] The clock gives me my cue,"
21746,and my assurance bids me search. There I shall find Falstaff. I shall
21747,"be rather praised for this than mocked, for it is as positive as the"
21748,earth is firm that Falstaff is there. I will go.
21749,"Enter Page, Shallow, Slender, Host, Sir Hugh Evans, Caius and Rugby."
21750,"Well met, Master Ford."
21751,"Trust me, a good knot. I have good cheer at home, and I pray you all go"
21752,"I must excuse myself, Master Ford."
21753,"And so must I, sir; we have appointed to dine with Mistress Anne, and I"
21754,would not break with her for more money than I’ll speak of.
21755,"We have lingered about a match between Anne Page and my cousin Slender,"
21756,and this day we shall have our answer.
21757,"I hope I have your good will, father Page."
21758,"You have, Master Slender, I stand wholly for you.—But my wife, Master"
21759,"doctor, is for you altogether."
21760,"Ay, be-gar; and de maid is love-a me! My nursh-a Quickly tell me so"
21761,"What say you to young Master Fenton? He capers, he dances, he has eyes"
21762,"of youth, he writes verses, he speaks holiday, he smells April and May."
21763,"He will carry ’t, he will carry ’t. ’Tis in his buttons he will carry"
21764,"Not by my consent, I promise you. The gentleman is of no having. He"
21765,kept company with the wild Prince and Poins. He is of too high a
21766,"region, he knows too much. No, he shall not knit a knot in his fortunes"
21767,"with the finger of my substance. If he take her, let him take her"
21768,"simply. The wealth I have waits on my consent, and my consent goes not"
21769,"I beseech you, heartily, some of you go home with me to dinner. Besides"
21770,"your cheer, you shall have sport: I will show you a monster. Master"
21771,"Doctor, you shall go; so shall you, Master Page, and you, Sir Hugh."
21772,"Well, fare you well. We shall have the freer wooing at Master Page’s."
21773,"Go home, John Rugby; I come anon."
21774,"Farewell, my hearts. I will to my honest knight Falstaff, and drink"
21775,"him dance.—Will you go, gentles?"
21776,Have with you to see this monster.
21777,SCENE III. A room in Ford’s house
21778,Enter Mistress Ford and Mistress Page.
21779,"What, John! What, Robert!"
21780,"Quickly, quickly! Is the buck-basket—"
21781,"I warrant.—What, Robin, I say!"
21782,Enter John and Robert with a great buck-basket.
21783,"Here, set it down."
21784,Give your men the charge; we must be brief.
21785,"Marry, as I told you before, John and Robert, be ready here hard by in"
21786,"the brew-house; and when I suddenly call you, come forth, and, without"
21787,"any pause or staggering, take this basket on your shoulders. That done,"
21788,"trudge with it in all haste, and carry it among the whitsters in"
21789,"Datchet Mead, and there empty it in the muddy ditch close by the Thames"
21790,You will do it?
21791,"I ha’ told them over and over, they lack no direction.—Be gone, and"
21792,come when you are called.
21793,Here comes little Robin.
21794,"How now, my eyas-musket, what news with you?"
21795,"My Master, Sir John, is come in at your back door, Mistress Ford, and"
21796,"You little Jack-a-Lent, have you been true to us?"
21797,"Ay, I’ll be sworn. My master knows not of your being here, and hath"
21798,threatened to put me into everlasting liberty if I tell you of it; for
21799,he swears he’ll turn me away.
21800,"Thou’rt a good boy, this secrecy of thine shall be a tailor to thee,"
21801,and shall make thee a new doublet and hose. I’ll go hide me.
21802,Do so.—Go tell thy master I am alone.
21803,"Mistress Page, remember you your cue."
21804,"I warrant thee. If I do not act it, hiss me."
21805,"Go to, then. We’ll use this unwholesome humidity, this gross watery"
21806,pumpion; we’ll teach him to know turtles from jays.
21807,"“Have I caught thee, my heavenly jewel?” Why, now let me die, for I"
21808,have lived long enough. This is the period of my ambition. O this
21809,"O, sweet Sir John!"
21810,"Mistress Ford, I cannot cog, I cannot prate, Mistress Ford. Now shall I"
21811,sin in my wish: I would thy husband were dead. I’ll speak it before the
21812,best lord: I would make thee my lady.
21813,"I your lady, Sir John? Alas, I should be a pitiful lady."
21814,Let the court of France show me such another. I see how thine eye would
21815,emulate the diamond. Thou hast the right arched beauty of the brow that
21816,"becomes the ship-tire, the tire-valiant, or any tire of Venetian"
21817,"A plain kerchief, Sir John. My brows become nothing else, nor that well"
21818,"By the Lord, thou art a traitor to say so. Thou wouldst make an"
21819,"absolute courtier, and the firm fixture of thy foot would give an"
21820,excellent motion to thy gait in a semi-circled farthingale. I see what
21821,"thou wert, if Fortune thy foe were not, Nature thy friend. Come, thou"
21822,canst not hide it.
21823,"Believe me, there’s no such thing in me."
21824,What made me love thee? Let that persuade thee there’s something
21825,"extraordinary in thee. Come, I cannot cog and say thou art this and"
21826,"that, like a many of these lisping hawthorn buds that come like women"
21827,"in men’s apparel, and smell like Bucklersbury in simple-time. I cannot."
21828,"But I love thee, none but thee; and thou deservest it."
21829,"Do not betray me, sir; I fear you love Mistress Page."
21830,"Thou mightst as well say I love to walk by the Counter gate, which is"
21831,as hateful to me as the reek of a lime-kiln.
21832,"Well, heaven knows how I love you, and you shall one day find it."
21833,"Keep in that mind, I’ll deserve it."
21834,"Nay, I must tell you, so you do; or else I could not be in that mind."
21835,"Mistress Ford, Mistress Ford, here’s Mistress Page at the door,"
21836,"sweating and blowing and looking wildly, and would needs speak with you"
21837,She shall not see me; I will ensconce me behind the arras.
21838,"Pray you, do so; she’s a very tattling woman."
21839,What’s the matter? How now?
21840,"O Mistress Ford, what have you done? You’re shamed, you’re overthrown,"
21841,you’re undone for ever!
21842,"What’s the matter, good Mistress Page?"
21843,"O well-a-day, Mistress Ford, having an honest man to your husband, to"
21844,give him such cause of suspicion!
21845,What cause of suspicion?
21846,What cause of suspicion? Out upon you! How am I mistook in you!
21847,"Why, alas, what’s the matter?"
21848,"Your husband’s coming hither, woman, with all the officers in Windsor,"
21849,"to search for a gentleman that he says is here now in the house, by"
21850,"your consent, to take an ill advantage of his absence. You are undone."
21851,"’Tis not so, I hope."
21852,"Pray heaven it be not so, that you have such a man here! But ’tis most"
21853,"certain your husband’s coming, with half Windsor at his heels, to"
21854,search for such a one. I come before to tell you. If you know yourself
21855,"clear, why, I am glad of it; but if you have a friend here, convey,"
21856,"convey him out. Be not amazed, call all your senses to you; defend your"
21857,"reputation, or bid farewell to your good life for ever."
21858,"What shall I do? There is a gentleman, my dear friend; and I fear not"
21859,mine own shame as much as his peril. I had rather than a thousand pound
21860,he were out of the house.
21861,For shame! Never stand “you had rather” and “you had rather”. Your
21862,husband’s here at hand. Bethink you of some conveyance. In the house
21863,"you cannot hide him. O, how have you deceived me! Look, here is a"
21864,"basket. If he be of any reasonable stature, he may creep in here; and"
21865,"throw foul linen upon him, as if it were going to bucking. Or—it is"
21866,whiting-time—send him by your two men to Datchet Mead.
21867,He’s too big to go in there. What shall I do?
21868,"’t! I’ll in, I’ll in. Follow your friend’s counsel. I’ll in."
21869,"What, Sir John Falstaff? Are these your letters, knight?"
21870,"I love thee, and none but thee. Help me away. Let me creep in here."
21871,"Help to cover your master, boy.—Call your men, Mistress Ford.—You"
21872,"What, John! Robert! John!"
21873,Enter John and Robert.
21874,"Go, take up these clothes here, quickly. Where’s the cowl-staff? Look"
21875,"how you drumble! Carry them to the laundress in Datchet Mead; quickly,"
21876,"Enter Ford, Page, Caius and Sir Hugh Evans."
21877,"Pray you come near. If I suspect without cause, why then make sport at"
21878,"me, then let me be your jest; I deserve it.—How now? Whither bear you"
21879,"To the laundress, forsooth."
21880,"Why, what have you to do whither they bear it? You were best meddle"
21881,"Buck? I would I could wash myself of the buck! Buck, buck, buck! Ay,"
21882,"buck! I warrant you, buck, and of the season too, it shall appear."
21883,"Gentlemen, I have dreamed tonight; I’ll tell you my dream. Here, here,"
21884,"here be my keys. Ascend my chambers, search, seek, find out. I’ll"
21885,warrant we’ll unkennel the fox. Let me stop this way first. [_Locks the
21886,"door_.] So, now uncape."
21887,"Good Master Ford, be contented: you wrong yourself too much."
21888,"True, Master Page.—Up, gentlemen, you shall see sport anon. Follow me,"
21889,This is fery fantastical humours and jealousies.
21890,"By gar, ’tis no the fashion of France; it is not jealous in France."
21891,"Nay, follow him, gentlemen; see the issue of his search."
21892,Is there not a double excellency in this?
21893,"I know not which pleases me better, that my husband is deceived, or Sir"
21894,What a taking was he in when your husband asked who was in the basket!
21895,"I am half afraid he will have need of washing, so throwing him into the"
21896,water will do him a benefit.
21897,"Hang him, dishonest rascal! I would all of the same strain were in the"
21898,I think my husband hath some special suspicion of Falstaff’s being
21899,"here, for I never saw him so gross in his jealousy till now."
21900,"I will lay a plot to try that, and we will yet have more tricks with"
21901,Falstaff. His dissolute disease will scarce obey this medicine.
21902,"Shall we send that foolish carrion Mistress Quickly to him, and excuse"
21903,"his throwing into the water, and give him another hope, to betray him"
21904,We will do it. Let him be sent for tomorrow eight o’clock to have
21905,"Enter Ford, Page, Caius and Sir Hugh Evans."
21906,I cannot find him. Maybe the knave bragged of that he could not
21907,"You use me well, Master Ford, do you?"
21908,"Ay, I do so."
21909,Heaven make you better than your thoughts!
21910,"You do yourself mighty wrong, Master Ford."
21911,"Ay, ay; I must bear it."
21912,"If there be anypody in the house, and in the chambers, and in the"
21913,"coffers, and in the presses, heaven forgive my sins at the day of"
21914,"Be gar, nor I too; there is nobodies."
21915,"Fie, fie, Master Ford, are you not ashamed? What spirit, what devil"
21916,suggests this imagination? I would not ha’ your distemper in this kind
21917,for the wealth of Windsor Castle.
21918,"’Tis my fault, Master Page. I suffer for it."
21919,You suffer for a pad conscience. Your wife is as honest a ’omans as I
21920,"will desires among five thousand, and five hundred too."
21921,"By gar, I see ’tis an honest woman."
21922,"Well, I promised you a dinner. Come, come, walk in the park. I pray you"
21923,pardon me; I will hereafter make known to you why I have done this.
21924,"Come, wife, come, Mistress Page, I pray you pardon me. Pray heartily,"
21925,"Let’s go in, gentlemen; but, trust me, we’ll mock him. I do invite you"
21926,"tomorrow morning to my house to breakfast; after, we’ll a-birding"
21927,together; I have a fine hawk for the bush. Shall it be so?
21928,"If there is one, I shall make two in the company."
21929,"If there be one or two, I shall make-a the turd."
21930,"Pray you go, Master Page."
21931,"I pray you now, remembrance tomorrow on the lousy knave, mine host."
21932,"Dat is good, by gar, with all my heart."
21933,"A lousy knave, to have his gibes and his mockeries!"
21934,SCENE IV. A room in Page’s house
21935,Enter Fenton and Anne Page.
21936,I see I cannot get thy father’s love;
21937,"Therefore no more turn me to him, sweet Nan."
21938,"Why, thou must be thyself."
21939,"He doth object I am too great of birth,"
21940,"And that my state being galled with my expense,"
21941,I seek to heal it only by his wealth.
21942,"Besides these, other bars he lays before me:"
21943,"My riots past, my wild societies—"
21944,And tells me ’tis a thing impossible
21945,I should love thee but as a property.
21946,Maybe he tells you true.
21947,"No, heaven so speed me in my time to come!"
21948,Albeit I will confess thy father’s wealth
21949,"Was the first motive that I wooed thee, Anne,"
21950,"Yet, wooing thee, I found thee of more value"
21951,Than stamps in gold or sums in sealed bags.
21952,And ’tis the very riches of thyself
21953,That now I aim at.
21954,"Yet seek my father’s love, still seek it, sir."
21955,If opportunity and humblest suit
21956,"Cannot attain it, why then—hark you hither."
21957,"Enter Shallow, Slender and Mistress Quickly."
21958,"Break their talk, Mistress Quickly. My kinsman shall speak for himself."
21959,"I’ll make a shaft or a bolt on ’t. ’Slid, ’tis but venturing."
21960,"No, she shall not dismay me. I care not for that, but that I am afeard."
21961,"Hark ye, Master Slender would speak a word with you."
21962,I come to him.
21963,"O, what a world of vile ill-favoured faults"
21964,Looks handsome in three hundred pounds a year!
21965,"And how does good Master Fenton? Pray you, a word with you."
21966,"I had a father, Mistress Anne; my uncle can tell you good jests of"
21967,"him.—Pray you, uncle, tell Mistress Anne the jest how my father stole"
21968,"two geese out of a pen, good uncle."
21969,"Mistress Anne, my cousin loves you."
21970,"Ay, that I do, as well as I love any woman in Gloucestershire."
21971,He will maintain you like a gentlewoman.
21972,"Ay, that I will, come cut and long-tail, under the degree of a squire."
21973,He will make you a hundred and fifty pounds jointure.
21974,"Good Master Shallow, let him woo for himself."
21975,"Marry, I thank you for it, I thank you for that good comfort.—She calls"
21976,"you, coz; I’ll leave you."
21977,"Now, good Mistress Anne."
21978,What is your will?
21979,"My will? ’Od’s heartlings, that’s a pretty jest indeed! I ne’er made my"
21980,"will yet, I thank heaven. I am not such a sickly creature, I give"
21981,"I mean, Master Slender, what would you with me?"
21982,"Truly, for mine own part I would little or nothing with you. Your"
21983,"father and my uncle hath made motions. If it be my luck, so; if not,"
21984,happy man be his dole. They can tell you how things go better than I
21985,can. You may ask your father. Here he comes.
21986,Enter Page and Mistress Page.
21987,"Now, Master Slender.—Love him, daughter Anne.—"
21988,"Why, how now? What does Master Fenton here?"
21989,"You wrong me, sir, thus still to haunt my house."
21990,"I told you, sir, my daughter is disposed of."
21991,"Nay, Master Page, be not impatient."
21992,"Good Master Fenton, come not to my child."
21993,She is no match for you.
21994,"Sir, will you hear me?"
21995,"No, good Master Fenton.—"
21996,"Come, Master Shallow; come, son Slender, in.—"
21997,"Knowing my mind, you wrong me, Master Fenton."
21998,Speak to Mistress Page.
21999,"Good Mistress Page, for that I love your daughter"
22000,"In such a righteous fashion as I do,"
22001,"Perforce, against all checks, rebukes, and manners,"
22002,I must advance the colours of my love
22003,And not retire. Let me have your good will.
22004,"Good mother, do not marry me to yond fool."
22005,I mean it not; I seek you a better husband.
22006,"That’s my master, Master Doctor."
22007,"Alas, I had rather be set quick i’ th’ earth,"
22008,And bowled to death with turnips.
22009,"Come, trouble not yourself, good Master Fenton,"
22010,"I will not be your friend, nor enemy."
22011,"My daughter will I question how she loves you,"
22012,"And as I find her, so am I affected."
22013,"Till then, farewell, sir. She must needs go in;"
22014,Her father will be angry.
22015,"Farewell, gentle mistress. Farewell, Nan."
22016,"This is my doing now. “Nay,” said I, “will you cast away your child on"
22017,"a fool, and a physician? Look on Master Fenton.” This is my doing."
22018,"I thank thee; and I pray thee, once tonight"
22019,Give my sweet Nan this ring. There’s for thy pains.
22020,Now Heaven send thee good fortune!
22021,A kind heart he hath. A woman would run through fire and water for such
22022,"a kind heart. But yet I would my master had Mistress Anne, or I would"
22023,"Master Slender had her; or, in sooth, I would Master Fenton had her. I"
22024,"will do what I can for them all three, for so I have promised and I’ll"
22025,"be as good as my word—but speciously for Master Fenton. Well, I must of"
22026,another errand to Sir John Falstaff from my two mistresses. What a
22027,beast am I to slack it!
22028,SCENE V. A room in the Garter Inn
22029,Go fetch me a quart of sack; put a toast in ’t.
22030,Have I lived to be carried in a basket like a barrow of butcher’s
22031,"offal, and to be thrown in the Thames? Well, if I be served such"
22032,"another trick, I’ll have my brains ta’en out and buttered, and give"
22033,"them to a dog for a New Year’s gift. ’Sblood, the rogues slighted me"
22034,into the river with as little remorse as they would have drowned a
22035,"blind bitch’s puppies, fifteen i’ the litter; and you may know by my"
22036,size that I have a kind of alacrity in sinking; if the bottom were as
22037,"deep as hell, I should down. I had been drowned, but that the shore was"
22038,"shelvy and shallow—a death that I abhor, for the water swells a man,"
22039,and what a thing should I have been when I had been swelled! I should
22040,have been a mountain of mummy.
22041,Enter Bardolph with sack.
22042,"Here’s Mistress Quickly, sir, to speak with you."
22043,"Come, let me pour in some sack to the Thames water, for my belly’s as"
22044,cold as if I had swallowed snowballs for pills to cool the reins. Call
22045,"By your leave, I cry you mercy. Give your worship good morrow."
22046,"Take away these chalices. Go, brew me a pottle of sack finely."
22047,Simple of itself. I’ll no pullet sperm in my brewage.
22048,"Marry, sir, I come to your worship from Mistress Ford."
22049,"Mistress Ford? I have had ford enough. I was thrown into the ford, I"
22050,have my belly full of ford.
22051,"Alas the day, good heart, that was not her fault. She does so take on"
22052,with her men; they mistook their erection.
22053,"So did I mine, to build upon a foolish woman’s promise."
22054,"Well, she laments, sir, for it, that it would yearn your heart to see"
22055,it. Her husband goes this morning a-birding; she desires you once more
22056,"to come to her, between eight and nine. I must carry her word quickly."
22057,"She’ll make you amends, I warrant you."
22058,"Well, I will visit her. Tell her so, and bid her think what a man is."
22059,"Let her consider his frailty, and then judge of my merit."
22060,I will tell her.
22061,"Do so. Between nine and ten, sayst thou?"
22062,"Eight and nine, sir."
22063,"Well, be gone. I will not miss her."
22064,"Peace be with you, sir."
22065,I marvel I hear not of Master Brook; he sent me word to stay within. I
22066,"like his money well. O, here he comes."
22067,"God bless you, sir."
22068,"Now, Master Brook, you come to know what hath passed between me and"
22069,"That indeed, Sir John, is my business."
22070,"Master Brook, I will not lie to you. I was at her house the hour she"
22071,"And how sped you, sir?"
22072,"Very ill-favouredly, Master Brook."
22073,"How so, sir? Did she change her determination?"
22074,"No. Master Brook, but the peaking cornuto her husband, Master Brook,"
22075,"dwelling in a continual ’larum of jealousy, comes me in the instant of"
22076,"our encounter, after we had embraced, kissed, protested, and, as it"
22077,"were, spoke the prologue of our comedy; and at his heels a rabble of"
22078,"his companions, thither provoked and instigated by his distemper, and,"
22079,"forsooth, to search his house for his wife’s love."
22080,"What, while you were there?"
22081,While I was there.
22082,"And did he search for you, and could not find you?"
22083,"You shall hear. As good luck would have it, comes in one Mistress Page,"
22084,"gives intelligence of Ford’s approach; and, in her invention and Ford’s"
22085,"wife’s distraction, they conveyed me into a buck-basket."
22086,"By the Lord, a buck-basket! Rammed me in with foul shirts and smocks,"
22087,"socks, foul stockings, greasy napkins, that, Master Brook, there was"
22088,the rankest compound of villainous smell that ever offended nostril.
22089,And how long lay you there?
22090,"Nay, you shall hear, Master Brook, what I have suffered to bring this"
22091,"woman to evil for your good. Being thus crammed in the basket, a couple"
22092,"of Ford’s knaves, his hinds, were called forth by their mistress to"
22093,carry me in the name of foul clothes to Datchet Lane. They took me on
22094,"their shoulders, met the jealous knave their master in the door, who"
22095,asked them once or twice what they had in their basket. I quaked for
22096,"fear lest the lunatic knave would have searched it; but Fate, ordaining"
22097,"he should be a cuckold, held his hand. Well, on went he for a search,"
22098,"and away went I for foul clothes. But mark the sequel, Master Brook. I"
22099,"suffered the pangs of three several deaths: first, an intolerable"
22100,"fright to be detected with a jealous rotten bell-wether; next, to be"
22101,"compassed like a good bilbo in the circumference of a peck, hilt to"
22102,"point, heel to head; and then, to be stopped in, like a strong"
22103,"distillation, with stinking clothes that fretted in their own grease."
22104,"Think of that, a man of my kidney, think of that—that am as subject to"
22105,heat as butter; a man of continual dissolution and thaw. It was a
22106,"miracle to ’scape suffocation. And in the height of this bath, when I"
22107,"was more than half stewed in grease, like a Dutch dish, to be thrown"
22108,"into the Thames and cooled, glowing hot, in that surge, like a"
22109,"horseshoe! Think of that—hissing hot—think of that, Master Brook."
22110,"In good sadness, sir, I am sorry that for my sake you have suffered all"
22111,"this. My suit, then, is desperate. You’ll undertake her no more?"
22112,"Master Brook, I will be thrown into Etna, as I have been into Thames,"
22113,ere I will leave her thus. Her husband is this morning gone a-birding;
22114,I have received from her another embassy of meeting. ’Twixt eight and
22115,"nine is the hour, Master Brook."
22116,"’Tis past eight already, sir."
22117,Is it? I will then address me to my appointment. Come to me at your
22118,"convenient leisure, and you shall know how I speed; and the conclusion"
22119,"shall be crowned with your enjoying her. Adieu. You shall have her,"
22120,"Master Brook. Master Brook, you shall cuckold Ford."
22121,"Hum! Ha! Is this a vision? Is this a dream? Do I sleep? Master Ford,"
22122,"awake; awake, Master Ford! There’s a hole made in your best coat,"
22123,Master Ford. This ’tis to be married; this ’tis to have linen and
22124,"buck-baskets! Well, I will proclaim myself what I am. I will now take"
22125,the lecher. He is at my house. He cannot scape me. ’Tis impossible he
22126,"should. He cannot creep into a half-penny purse, nor into a pepperbox."
22127,"But, lest the devil that guides him should aid him, I will search"
22128,"impossible places. Though what I am I cannot avoid, yet to be what I"
22129,"would not shall not make me tame. If I have horns to make one mad, let"
22130,the proverb go with me: I’ll be horn-mad.
22131,SCENE I. The street
22132,"Enter Mistress Page, Mistress Quickly and William."
22133,"Is he at Master Ford’s already, think’st thou?"
22134,Sure he is by this; or will be presently. But truly he is very
22135,courageous mad about his throwing into the water. Mistress Ford desires
22136,you to come suddenly.
22137,I’ll be with her by and by. I’ll but bring my young man here to school.
22138,"Look where his master comes; ’tis a playing day, I see."
22139,Enter Sir Hugh Evans.
22140,"How now, Sir Hugh, no school today?"
22141,"No, Master Slender is let the boys leave to play."
22142,Blessing of his heart!
22143,"Sir Hugh, my husband says my son profits nothing in the world at his"
22144,book. I pray you ask him some questions in his accidence.
22145,"Come hither, William. Hold up your head, come."
22146,"Come on, sirrah. Hold up your head. Answer your master, be not afraid."
22147,"William, how many numbers is in nouns?"
22148,"Truly, I thought there had been one number more, because they say"
22149,"Peace your tattlings! What is “fair,” William?"
22150,"Polecats? There are fairer things than polecats, sure."
22151,"You are a very simplicity ’oman; I pray you, peace.—What is _lapis_,"
22152,"And what is “a stone,” William?"
22153,"No, it is _lapis_. I pray you remember in your prain."
22154,"That is a good William. What is he, William, that does lend articles?"
22155,"Articles are borrowed of the pronoun, and be thus declined:"
22156,"_singulariter, nominativo, hic, haec, hoc_."
22157,"_Nominativo, hig, haeg, hog_, pray you, mark: _genitivo, huius_. Well,"
22158,what is your accusative case?
22159,"I pray you, have your remembrance, child. _Accusativo, hung, hang,"
22160,"“Hang-hog” is Latin for bacon, I warrant you."
22161,"Leave your prabbles, ’oman.—What is the focative case, William?"
22162,"Remember, William; focative is _caret_."
22163,And that’s a good root.
22164,"What is your genitive case plural, William?"
22165,"Genitive: _horum, harum, horum_."
22166,"Vengeance of Jenny’s case, fie on her! Never name her, child, if she be"
22167,You do ill to teach the child such words.—He teaches him to hick and to
22168,"hack, which they’ll do fast enough of themselves; and to call “whore"
22169,"’Oman, art thou lunatics? Hast thou no understandings for thy cases,"
22170,and the numbers of the genders? Thou art as foolish Christian creatures
22171,as I would desires.
22172,"Show me now, William, some declensions of your pronouns."
22173,"Forsooth, I have forgot."
22174,"It is _qui, quae, quod_. If you forget your _quis_, your _quaes_, and"
22175,"your _quods_, you must be preeches. Go your ways and play, go."
22176,He is a better scholar than I thought he was.
22177,"He is a good sprag memory. Farewell, Mistress Page."
22178,"Adieu, good Sir Hugh."
22179,"Get you home, boy. Come, we stay too long."
22180,SCENE II. A room in Ford’s house
22181,Enter Falstaff and Mistress Ford.
22182,"Mistress Ford, your sorrow hath eaten up my sufferance. I see you are"
22183,"obsequious in your love, and I profess requital to a hair’s breadth,"
22184,"not only, Mistress Ford, in the simple office of love, but in all the"
22185,"accoutrement, compliment, and ceremony of it. But are you sure of your"
22186,"He’s a-birding, sweet Sir John."
22187,"Step into the chamber, Sir John."
22188,"How now, sweetheart, who’s at home besides yourself?"
22189,"Why, none but mine own people."
22190,"Truly, I am so glad you have nobody here."
22191,"Why, woman, your husband is in his old lunes again. He so takes on"
22192,"yonder with my husband, so rails against all married mankind, so curses"
22193,"all Eve’s daughters, of what complexion soever, and so buffets himself"
22194,"on the forehead, crying “Peer out, peer out!” that any madness I ever"
22195,"yet beheld seemed but tameness, civility, and patience, to this his"
22196,distemper he is in now. I am glad the fat knight is not here.
22197,"Why, does he talk of him?"
22198,"Of none but him, and swears he was carried out, the last time he"
22199,"searched for him, in a basket; protests to my husband he is now here;"
22200,"and hath drawn him and the rest of their company from their sport, to"
22201,make another experiment of his suspicion. But I am glad the knight is
22202,not here. Now he shall see his own foolery.
22203,"How near is he, Mistress Page?"
22204,"Hard by, at street end. He will be here anon."
22205,I am undone! The knight is here.
22206,"Why, then, you are utterly shamed, and he’s but a dead man. What a"
22207,"woman are you! Away with him, away with him! Better shame than murder."
22208,Which way should he go? How should I bestow him? Shall I put him into
22209,"No, I’ll come no more i’ the basket. May I not go out ere he come?"
22210,"Alas, three of Master Ford’s brothers watch the door with pistols, that"
22211,"none shall issue out, otherwise you might slip away ere he came. But"
22212,what make you here?
22213,What shall I do? I’ll creep up into the chimney.
22214,There they always use to discharge their birding-pieces.
22215,Creep into the kiln-hole.
22216,"He will seek there, on my word. Neither press, coffer, chest, trunk,"
22217,"well, vault, but he hath an abstract for the remembrance of such"
22218,"places, and goes to them by his note. There is no hiding you in the"
22219,I’ll go out then.
22220,"If you go out in your own semblance, you die, Sir John—unless you go"
22221,How might we disguise him?
22222,"Alas the day, I know not. There is no woman’s gown big enough for him;"
22223,"otherwise he might put on a hat, a muffler, and a kerchief, and so"
22224,"Good hearts, devise something. Any extremity rather than a mischief."
22225,"My maid’s aunt, the fat woman of Brentford, has a gown above."
22226,"On my word, it will serve him. She’s as big as he is. And there’s her"
22227,"thrummed hat, and her muffler too.—Run up, Sir John."
22228,"Go, go, sweet Sir John. Mistress Page and I will look some linen for"
22229,"Quick, quick! We’ll come dress you straight; put on the gown the while."
22230,I would my husband would meet him in this shape. He cannot abide the
22231,"old woman of Brentford; he swears she’s a witch, forbade her my house,"
22232,and hath threatened to beat her.
22233,Heaven guide him to thy husband’s cudgel and the devil guide his cudgel
22234,But is my husband coming?
22235,"Ay, in good sadness is he, and talks of the basket too, howsoever he"
22236,"We’ll try that; for I’ll appoint my men to carry the basket again, to"
22237,meet him at the door with it as they did last time.
22238,"Nay, but he’ll be here presently. Let’s go dress him like the witch of"
22239,"I’ll first direct my men what they shall do with the basket. Go up,"
22240,I’ll bring linen for him straight.
22241,"Hang him, dishonest varlet! We cannot misuse him enough."
22242,"We’ll leave a proof, by that which we will do,"
22243,Wives may be merry and yet honest too.
22244,We do not act that often jest and laugh;
22245,’Tis old but true: “Still swine eats all the draff.”
22246,Enter Mistress Ford with John and Robert.
22247,"Go, sirs, take the basket again on your shoulders. Your master is hard"
22248,"at door; if he bid you set it down, obey him. Quickly, dispatch."
22249,"Come, come, take it up."
22250,Pray heaven it be not full of knight again.
22251,"I hope not, I had lief as bear so much lead."
22252,"Enter Ford, Page, Shallow, Caius and Sir Hugh Evans."
22253,"Ay, but if it prove true, Master Page, have you any way then to unfool"
22254,"me again?—Set down the basket, villain! Somebody call my wife. Youth in"
22255,"a basket! O you panderly rascals! There’s a knot, a gin, a pack, a"
22256,"conspiracy against me. Now shall the devil be shamed.—What, wife, I"
22257,"say! Come, come forth! Behold what honest clothes you send forth to"
22258,"Why, this passes, Master Ford! You are not to go loose any longer; you"
22259,"Why, this is lunatics, this is mad as a mad dog."
22260,"Indeed, Master Ford, this is not well, indeed."
22261,"So say I too, sir."
22262,"Come hither, Mistress Ford—Mistress Ford, the honest woman, the modest"
22263,"wife, the virtuous creature, that hath the jealous fool to her husband!"
22264,"I suspect without cause, mistress, do I?"
22265,"Heaven be my witness you do, if you suspect me in any dishonesty."
22266,"Well said, brazen-face, hold it out.—Come forth, sirrah."
22267,Are you not ashamed? Let the clothes alone.
22268,I shall find you anon.
22269,"’Tis unreasonable. Will you take up your wife’s clothes? Come, away."
22270,"Empty the basket, I say."
22271,"Master Page, as I am a man, there was one conveyed out of my house"
22272,yesterday in this basket. Why may not he be there again? In my house I
22273,"am sure he is. My intelligence is true, my jealousy is"
22274,reasonable.—Pluck me out all the linen.
22275,"If you find a man there, he shall die a flea’s death."
22276,"By my fidelity, this is not well, Master Ford, this wrongs you."
22277,"Master Ford, you must pray, and not follow the imaginations of your own"
22278,heart. This is jealousies.
22279,"Well, he’s not here I seek for."
22280,"No, nor nowhere else but in your brain."
22281,"Help to search my house this one time. If I find not what I seek, show"
22282,"no colour for my extremity, let me for ever be your table-sport. Let"
22283,"them say of me “As jealous as Ford, that searched a hollow walnut for"
22284,"his wife’s leman.” Satisfy me once more, once more search with me."
22285,"What, ho, Mistress Page! Come you and the old woman down; my husband"
22286,will come into the chamber.
22287,Old woman? What old woman’s that?
22288,"Why, it is my maid’s aunt of Brentford."
22289,"A witch, a quean, an old cozening quean! Have I not forbid her my"
22290,"house? She comes of errands, does she? We are simple men; we do not"
22291,know what’s brought to pass under the profession of fortune-telling.
22292,"She works by charms, by spells, by the figure, and such daubery as this"
22293,"is, beyond our element. We know nothing.—Come down, you witch, you hag,"
22294,"you! Come down, I say!"
22295,"Nay, good sweet husband!—Good gentlemen, let him not strike the old"
22296,"Enter Falstaff disguised as an old woman, led by Mistress Page."
22297,"Come, Mother Prat; come, give me your hand."
22298,"I’ll prat her. [_Beats him_.] Out of my door, you witch, you rag, you"
22299,"baggage, you polecat, you runnion! Out, out! I’ll conjure you, I’ll"
22300,Are you not ashamed? I think you have killed the poor woman.
22301,"Nay, he will do it. ’Tis a goodly credit for you."
22302,"By yea and no, I think the ’oman is a witch indeed. I like not when a"
22303,’oman has a great peard. I spy a great peard under her muffler.
22304,"Will you follow, gentlemen? I beseech you follow, see but the issue of"
22305,"my jealousy. If I cry out thus upon no trail, never trust me when I"
22306,"Let’s obey his humour a little further. Come, gentlemen."
22307,"Trust me, he beat him most pitifully."
22308,"Nay, by th’ mass, that he did not; he beat him most unpitifully,"
22309,I’ll have the cudgel hallowed and hung o’er the altar. It hath done
22310,"What think you? May we, with the warrant of womanhood and the witness"
22311,"of a good conscience, pursue him with any further revenge?"
22312,The spirit of wantonness is sure scared out of him. If the devil have
22313,"him not in fee-simple, with fine and recovery, he will never, I think,"
22314,"in the way of waste, attempt us again."
22315,Shall we tell our husbands how we have served him?
22316,"Yes, by all means, if it be but to scrape the figures out of your"
22317,husband’s brains. If they can find in their hearts the poor unvirtuous
22318,"fat knight shall be any further afflicted, we two will still be the"
22319,"I’ll warrant they’ll have him publicly shamed, and methinks there would"
22320,be no period to the jest should he not be publicly shamed.
22321,"Come, to the forge with it, then shape it. I would not have things"
22322,SCENE III. A room in the Garter Inn
22323,Enter Host and Bardolph.
22324,"Sir, the Germans desire to have three of your horses. The Duke himself"
22325,"will be tomorrow at court, and they are going to meet him."
22326,What duke should that be comes so secretly? I hear not of him in the
22327,court. Let me speak with the gentlemen. They speak English?
22328,"Ay, sir. I’ll call them to you."
22329,"They shall have my horses, but I’ll make them pay, I’ll sauce them."
22330,They have had my house a week at command; I have turned away my other
22331,"guests. They must come off, I’ll sauce them. Come."
22332,SCENE IV. A room in Ford’s house
22333,"Enter Page, Ford, Mistress Page, Mistress Ford and Sir Hugh Evans."
22334,’Tis one of the best discretions of a ’oman as ever I did look upon.
22335,And did he send you both these letters at an instant?
22336,Within a quarter of an hour.
22337,"Pardon me, wife. Henceforth, do what thou wilt."
22338,I rather will suspect the sun with cold
22339,"Than thee with wantonness. Now doth thy honour stand,"
22340,"In him that was of late an heretic,"
22341,As firm as faith.
22342,"’Tis well, ’tis well, no more."
22343,Be not as extreme in submission as in offence.
22344,But let our plot go forward. Let our wives
22345,"Yet once again, to make us public sport,"
22346,"Appoint a meeting with this old fat fellow,"
22347,Where we may take him and disgrace him for it.
22348,There is no better way than that they spoke of.
22349,"How? To send him word they’ll meet him in the park at midnight? Fie,"
22350,"fie, he’ll never come."
22351,"You say he has been thrown in the rivers, and has been grievously"
22352,"peaten as an old ’oman. Methinks there should be terrors in him, that"
22353,he should not come. Methinks his flesh is punished; he shall have no
22354,So think I too.
22355,"Devise but how you’ll use him when he comes,"
22356,And let us two devise to bring him thither.
22357,"There is an old tale goes that Herne the hunter,"
22358,"Sometime a keeper here in Windsor Forest,"
22359,"Doth all the winter time, at still midnight,"
22360,"Walk round about an oak, with great ragged horns,"
22361,"And there he blasts the tree, and takes the cattle,"
22362,"And makes milch-kine yield blood, and shakes a chain"
22363,In a most hideous and dreadful manner.
22364,"You have heard of such a spirit, and well you know"
22365,The superstitious idle-headed eld
22366,"Received and did deliver to our age,"
22367,This tale of Herne the hunter for a truth.
22368,"Why, yet there want not many that do fear"
22369,In deep of night to walk by this Herne’s oak.
22370,But what of this?
22371,"Marry, this is our device,"
22372,"That Falstaff at that oak shall meet with us,"
22373,"Disguised like Herne, with huge horns on his head."
22374,"Well, let it not be doubted but he’ll come,"
22375,"And in this shape; when you have brought him thither,"
22376,What shall be done with him? What is your plot?
22377,"That likewise have we thought upon, and thus:"
22378,"Nan Page my daughter, and my little son,"
22379,"And three or four more of their growth, we’ll dress"
22380,"Like urchins, oafs and fairies, green and white,"
22381,With rounds of waxen tapers on their heads
22382,"And rattles in their hands. Upon a sudden,"
22383,"As Falstaff, she, and I are newly met,"
22384,Let them from forth a sawpit rush at once
22385,With some diffused song; upon their sight
22386,We two in great amazedness will fly.
22387,"Then let them all encircle him about,"
22388,"And fairy-like, to pinch the unclean knight,"
22389,"And ask him why, that hour of fairy revel,"
22390,In their so sacred paths he dares to tread
22391,"And till he tell the truth,"
22392,Let the supposed fairies pinch him sound
22393,And burn him with their tapers.
22394,"The truth being known,"
22395,"We’ll all present ourselves, dis-horn the spirit,"
22396,And mock him home to Windsor.
22397,"Be practised well to this, or they’ll ne’er do ’t."
22398,"I will teach the children their behaviours, and I will be like a"
22399,"jackanapes also, to burn the knight with my taber."
22400,That will be excellent. I’ll go buy them vizards.
22401,"My Nan shall be the queen of all the fairies,"
22402,Finely attired in a robe of white.
22403,That silk will I go buy.
22404,"Shall Master Slender steal my Nan away,"
22405,"And marry her at Eton.—Go, send to Falstaff straight."
22406,"Nay, I’ll to him again in name of Brook."
22407,"He’ll tell me all his purpose. Sure, he’ll come."
22408,"Fear not you that. Go, get us properties"
22409,And tricking for our fairies.
22410,Let us about it. It is admirable pleasures and fery honest knaveries.
22411,Send quickly to Sir John to know his mind.
22412,"I’ll to the Doctor. He hath my good will,"
22413,"And none but he, to marry with Nan Page."
22414,"That Slender, though well landed, is an idiot,"
22415,And he my husband best of all affects.
22416,"The Doctor is well moneyed, and his friends"
22417,"Potent at court. He, none but he, shall have her,"
22418,Though twenty thousand worthier come to crave her.
22419,SCENE V. A room in the Garter Inn
22420,Enter Host and Simple.
22421,"What wouldst thou have, boor? What, thick-skin? Speak, breathe,"
22422,"discuss; brief, short, quick, snap."
22423,"Marry, sir, I come to speak with Sir John Falstaff from Master Slender."
22424,"There’s his chamber, his house, his castle, his standing-bed and"
22425,"truckle-bed. ’Tis painted about with the story of the Prodigal, fresh"
22426,"and new. Go, knock and call. He’ll speak like an Anthropophaginian unto"
22427,"thee. Knock, I say."
22428,"There’s an old woman, a fat woman, gone up into his chamber. I’ll be so"
22429,"bold as stay, sir, till she come down. I come to speak with her,"
22430,Ha? A fat woman? The knight may be robbed. I’ll call.—Bully knight!
22431,Bully Sir John! Speak from thy lungs military. Art thou there? It is
22432,"thine host, thine Ephesian, calls."
22433,Here’s a Bohemian-Tartar tarries the coming down of thy fat woman. Let
22434,"her descend, bully, let her descend. My chambers are honourable. Fie!"
22435,"There was, mine host, an old fat woman even now with me, but she’s"
22436,"Pray you, sir, was’t not the wise woman of Brentford?"
22437,"Ay, marry was it, mussel-shell. What would you with her?"
22438,"My master, sir, my Master Slender, sent to her, seeing her go through"
22439,"the streets, to know, sir, whether one Nym, sir, that beguiled him of a"
22440,"chain, had the chain or no."
22441,I spake with the old woman about it.
22442,"And what says she, I pray, sir?"
22443,"Marry, she says that the very same man that beguiled Master Slender of"
22444,his chain cozened him of it.
22445,I would I could have spoken with the woman herself. I had other things
22446,"to have spoken with her too, from him."
22447,What are they? Let us know.
22448,"I may not conceal them, sir."
22449,"Conceal them, or thou diest."
22450,"Why, sir, they were nothing but about Mistress Anne Page, to know if it"
22451,were my master’s fortune to have her or no.
22452,"’Tis, ’tis his fortune."
22453,"To have her, or no. Go, say the woman told me so."
22454,"May I be bold to say so, sir?"
22455,"Ay, sir; like who more bold?"
22456,I thank your worship; I shall make my master glad with these tidings.
22457,"Thou art clerkly, thou art clerkly, Sir John. Was there a wise woman"
22458,"Ay, that there was, mine host; one that hath taught me more wit than"
22459,"ever I learned before in my life; and I paid nothing for it neither,"
22460,but was paid for my learning.
22461,"Out, alas, sir, cozenage, mere cozenage!"
22462,"Where be my horses? Speak well of them, varletto."
22463,"Run away, with the cozeners. For so soon as I came beyond Eton, they"
22464,"threw me off from behind one of them, in a slough of mire, and set"
22465,"spurs and away, like three German devils, three Doctor Faustuses."
22466,"They are gone but to meet the Duke, villain, do not say they be fled."
22467,Germans are honest men.
22468,Enter Sir Hugh Evans.
22469,Where is mine host?
22470,"What is the matter, sir?"
22471,Have a care of your entertainments. There is a friend of mine come to
22472,town tells me there is three cozen-Germans that has cozened all the
22473,"hosts of Readings, of Maidenhead, of Colebrook, of horses and money. I"
22474,"tell you for good will, look you. You are wise, and full of gibes and"
22475,"vlouting-stocks, and ’tis not convenient you should be cozened. Fare"
22476,Vere is mine host de Jarteer?
22477,"Here, Master Doctor, in perplexity and doubtful dilemma."
22478,"I cannot tell vat is dat, but it is tell-a me dat you make grand"
22479,"preparation for a Duke de Jamany. By my trot, dere is no duke that the"
22480,court is know to come. I tell you for good will. Adieu.
22481,"Hue and cry, villain, go!—Assist me, knight, I am undone.—Fly, run, hue"
22482,"and cry, villain, I am undone!"
22483,"I would all the world might be cozened, for I have been cozened and"
22484,beaten too. If it should come to the ear of the court how I have been
22485,"transformed, and how my transformation hath been washed and cudgelled,"
22486,"they would melt me out of my fat drop by drop, and liquor fishermen’s"
22487,boots with me. I warrant they would whip me with their fine wits till I
22488,were as crestfallen as a dried pear. I never prospered since I forswore
22489,"myself at primero. Well, if my wind were but long enough, I would"
22490,"Now, whence come you?"
22491,"From the two parties, forsooth."
22492,"The devil take one party and his dam the other, and so they shall be"
22493,"both bestowed. I have suffered more for their sakes, more than the"
22494,villainous inconstancy of man’s disposition is able to bear.
22495,"And have not they suffered? Yes, I warrant, speciously one of them."
22496,"Mistress Ford, good heart, is beaten black and blue, that you cannot"
22497,see a white spot about her.
22498,What tellst thou me of black and blue? I was beaten myself into all the
22499,"colours of the rainbow, and was like to be apprehended for the witch of"
22500,"Brentford. But that my admirable dexterity of wit, my counterfeiting"
22501,"the action of an old woman, delivered me, the knave constable had set"
22502,"me i’ the stocks, i’ the common stocks, for a witch."
22503,"Sir, let me speak with you in your chamber, you shall hear how things"
22504,"go, and, I warrant, to your content. Here is a letter will say"
22505,"somewhat. Good hearts, what ado here is to bring you together! Sure,"
22506,"one of you does not serve heaven well, that you are so crossed."
22507,Come up into my chamber.
22508,SCENE VI. Another room in the Garter Inn
22509,Enter Fenton and Host.
22510,"Master Fenton, talk not to me. My mind is heavy. I will give over all."
22511,"Yet hear me speak. Assist me in my purpose,"
22512,"And, as I am a gentleman, I’ll give thee"
22513,A hundred pound in gold more than your loss.
22514,"I will hear you, Master Fenton, and I will, at the least, keep your"
22515,From time to time I have acquainted you
22516,"With the dear love I bear to fair Anne Page,"
22517,"Who mutually hath answered my affection,"
22518,"So far forth as herself might be her chooser,"
22519,Even to my wish. I have a letter from her
22520,"Of such contents as you will wonder at,"
22521,The mirth whereof so larded with my matter
22522,That neither singly can be manifested
22523,"Without the show of both, wherein fat Falstaff"
22524,Hath a great scene; the image of the jest
22525,"I’ll show you here at large. Hark, good mine host:"
22526,"Tonight at Herne’s oak, just ’twixt twelve and one,"
22527,Must my sweet Nan present the Fairy Queen—
22528,"The purpose why is here—in which disguise,"
22529,"While other jests are something rank on foot,"
22530,Her father hath commanded her to slip
22531,"Away with Slender, and with him at Eton"
22532,"Immediately to marry. She hath consented. Now, sir,"
22533,"Her mother, even strong against that match"
22534,"And firm for Doctor Caius, hath appointed"
22535,"That he shall likewise shuffle her away,"
22536,"While other sports are tasking of their minds,"
22537,"And at the dean’ry, where a priest attends,"
22538,Straight marry her. To this her mother’s plot
22539,"She, seemingly obedient, likewise hath"
22540,Made promise to the doctor. Now thus it rests:
22541,Her father means she shall be all in white
22542,"And in that habit, when Slender sees his time"
22543,"To take her by the hand and bid her go,"
22544,She shall go with him. Her mother hath intended
22545,"The better to denote her to the doctor,"
22546,For they must all be masked and vizarded—
22547,"That quaint in green she shall be loose enrobed,"
22548,With ribbons pendant flaring ’bout her head;
22549,"And when the doctor spies his vantage ripe,"
22550,"To pinch her by the hand, and on that token"
22551,The maid hath given consent to go with him.
22552,"Which means she to deceive, father or mother?"
22553,"Both, my good host, to go along with me."
22554,"And here it rests, that you’ll procure the vicar"
22555,"To stay for me at church, ’twixt twelve and one,"
22556,"And, in the lawful name of marrying,"
22557,To give our hearts united ceremony.
22558,"Well, husband your device; I’ll to the vicar."
22559,"Bring you the maid, you shall not lack a priest."
22560,So shall I evermore be bound to thee;
22561,"Besides, I’ll make a present recompense."
22562,SCENE I. A room in the Garter Inn
22563,Enter Falstaff and Mistress Quickly.
22564,"Prithee, no more prattling. Go. I’ll hold. This is the third time; I"
22565,"hope good luck lies in odd numbers. Away, go! They say there is"
22566,"divinity in odd numbers, either in nativity, chance, or death. Away!"
22567,"I’ll provide you a chain, and I’ll do what I can to get you a pair of"
22568,"Away, I say; time wears. Hold up your head, and mince."
22569,"How now, Master Brook! Master Brook, the matter will be known tonight"
22570,"or never. Be you in the park about midnight, at Herne’s oak, and you"
22571,"Went you not to her yesterday, sir, as you told me you had appointed?"
22572,"I went to her, Master Brook, as you see, like a poor old man, but I"
22573,"came from her, Master Brook, like a poor old woman. That same knave"
22574,"Ford, her husband, hath the finest mad devil of jealousy in him, Master"
22575,"Brook, that ever governed frenzy. I will tell you he beat me"
22576,"grievously, in the shape of a woman; for in the shape of man, Master"
22577,"Brook, I fear not Goliath with a weaver’s beam, because I know also"
22578,"life is a shuttle. I am in haste. Go along with me; I’ll tell you all,"
22579,"Master Brook. Since I plucked geese, played truant, and whipped top, I"
22580,"knew not what ’twas to be beaten till lately. Follow me, I’ll tell you"
22581,"strange things of this knave Ford, on whom tonight I will be revenged,"
22582,and I will deliver his wife into your hand. Follow. Strange things in
22583,"hand, Master Brook! Follow."
22584,SCENE II. Windsor Park
22585,"Enter Page, Shallow and Slender."
22586,"Come, come. We’ll couch i’ the castle ditch till we see the light of"
22587,"our fairies. Remember, son Slender, my daughter—"
22588,"Ay, forsooth. I have spoke with her, and we have a nay-word how to know"
22589,one another. I come to her in white and cry “mum”; she cries “budget”;
22590,and by that we know one another.
22591,That’s good too. But what needs either your “mum” or her “budget”? The
22592,white will decipher her well enough. It hath struck ten o’clock.
22593,The night is dark. Light and spirits will become it well. Heaven
22594,"prosper our sport! No man means evil but the devil, and we shall know"
22595,him by his horns. Let’s away; follow me.
22596,SCENE III. The street in Windsor
22597,"Enter Mistress Page, Mistress Ford and Doctor Caius."
22598,"Master Doctor, my daughter is in green. When you see your time, take"
22599,"her by the hand, away with her to the deanery, and dispatch it quickly."
22600,Go before into the park. We two must go together.
22601,I know vat I have to do. Adieu.
22602,"Fare you well, sir."
22603,My husband will not rejoice so much at the abuse of Falstaff as he will
22604,chafe at the doctor’s marrying my daughter. But ’tis no matter. Better
22605,a little chiding than a great deal of heartbreak.
22606,"Where is Nan now, and her troop of fairies, and the Welsh devil Hugh?"
22607,"They are all couched in a pit hard by Herne’s oak, with obscured"
22608,"lights, which, at the very instant of Falstaff’s and our meeting, they"
22609,will at once display to the night.
22610,That cannot choose but amaze him.
22611,"If he be not amazed, he will be mocked; if he be amazed, he will every"
22612,We’ll betray him finely.
22613,"Against such lewdsters and their lechery,"
22614,Those that betray them do no treachery.
22615,"The hour draws on. To the oak, to the oak!"
22616,SCENE IV. Windsor Park
22617,"Enter Sir Hugh Evans disguised, and children as Fairies."
22618,"Trib, trib, fairies. Come, and remember your parts. Be pold, I pray"
22619,"you, follow me into the pit, and when I give the watch-’ords, do as I"
22620,"pid you. Come, come; trib, trib."
22621,SCENE V. Another part of the Park
22622,Enter Falstaff wearing a buck’s head.
22623,"The Windsor bell hath struck twelve, the minute draws on. Now the"
22624,"hot-blooded gods assist me! Remember, Jove, thou wast a bull for thy"
22625,"Europa; love set on thy horns. O powerful love, that in some respects,"
22626,"makes a beast a man, in some other a man a beast! You were also,"
22627,"Jupiter, a swan for the love of Leda. O omnipotent love, how near the"
22628,god drew to the complexion of a goose! A fault done first in the form
22629,"of a beast; O Jove, a beastly fault! And then another fault in the"
22630,"semblance of a fowl; think on’t, Jove, a foul fault! When gods have hot"
22631,"backs, what shall poor men do? For me, I am here a Windsor stag, and"
22632,"the fattest, I think, i’ the forest. Send me a cool rut-time, Jove, or"
22633,who can blame me to piss my tallow? Who comes here? My doe?
22634,Enter Mistress Ford and Mistress Page.
22635,"Sir John? Art thou there, my deer, my male deer?"
22636,"My doe with the black scut! Let the sky rain potatoes, let it thunder"
22637,"to the tune of “Greensleeves”, hail kissing-comfits and snow eringoes;"
22638,"let there come a tempest of provocation, I will shelter me here."
22639,"Mistress Page is come with me, sweetheart."
22640,"Divide me like a bribed buck, each a haunch. I will keep my sides to"
22641,"myself, my shoulders for the fellow of this walk, and my horns I"
22642,"bequeath your husbands. Am I a woodman, ha? Speak I like Herne the"
22643,"hunter? Why, now is Cupid a child of conscience; he makes restitution."
22644,"As I am a true spirit, welcome!"
22645,Heaven forgive our sins!
22646,What should this be?
22647,MISTRESS FORD and MISTRESS PAGE.
22648,"I think the devil will not have me damned, lest the oil that’s in me"
22649,should set hell on fire; he would never else cross me thus.
22650,"Enter Mistress Quickly as the Queen of Fairies, Sir Hugh Evans as a"
22651,"Satyr, Pistol as Hobgoblin, Anne Page and children as Fairies, carrying"
22652,"Fairies, black, grey, green, and white,"
22653,"You moonshine revellers and shades of night,"
22654,"You orphan heirs of fixed destiny,"
22655,Attend your office and your quality.
22656,"Crier Hobgoblin, make the fairy oyes."
22657,"Elves, list your names; silence, you airy toys!"
22658,"Cricket, to Windsor chimneys shalt thou leap,"
22659,"Where fires thou find’st unraked and hearths unswept,"
22660,There pinch the maids as blue as bilberry.
22661,Our radiant queen hates sluts and sluttery.
22662,"They are fairies, he that speaks to them shall die."
22663,I’ll wink and couch. No man their works must eye.
22664,"Where’s Bead? Go you, and where you find a maid"
22665,"That ere she sleep has thrice her prayers said,"
22666,Rein up the organs of her fantasy;
22667,Sleep she as sound as careless infancy.
22668,"But those as sleep and think not on their sins,"
22669,"Pinch them, arms, legs, backs, shoulders, sides, and shins."
22670,"Search Windsor castle, elves, within and out."
22671,"Strew good luck, oafs, on every sacred room,"
22672,That it may stand till the perpetual doom
22673,"In state as wholesome as in state ’tis fit,"
22674,Worthy the owner and the owner it.
22675,The several chairs of order look you scour
22676,With juice of balm and every precious flower.
22677,"Each fair instalment, coat, and several crest,"
22678,"With loyal blazon, evermore be blest!"
22679,"And nightly, meadow-fairies, look you sing,"
22680,"Like to the Garter’s compass, in a ring."
22681,"Th’ expressure that it bears, green let it be,"
22682,More fertile-fresh than all the field to see;
22683,And _Honi soit qui mal y pense_ write
22684,"In em’rald tufts, flowers purple, blue and white,"
22685,"Like sapphire, pearl, and rich embroidery,"
22686,Buckled below fair knighthood’s bending knee.
22687,Fairies use flowers for their charactery.
22688,"Away, disperse! But till ’tis one o’clock,"
22689,Our dance of custom round about the oak
22690,Of Herne the hunter let us not forget.
22691,"Pray you, lock hand in hand, yourselves in order set;"
22692,"And twenty glow-worms shall our lanterns be,"
22693,To guide our measure round about the tree.
22694,"But stay, I smell a man of middle earth."
22695,"Heavens defend me from that Welsh fairy, lest he transform me to a"
22696,"Vile worm, thou wast o’erlooked even in thy birth."
22697,With trial-fire touch me his finger-end.
22698,"If he be chaste, the flame will back descend"
22699,"And turn him to no pain; but if he start,"
22700,It is the flesh of a corrupted heart.
22701,"Come, will this wood take fire?"
22702,"Corrupt, corrupt, and tainted in desire!"
22703,"About him, fairies, sing a scornful rhyme,"
22704,"And, as you trip, still pinch him to your time."
22705,Fie on sinful fantasy!
22706,Fie on lust and luxury!
22707,"Lust is but a bloody fire,"
22708,"Kindled with unchaste desire,"
22709,"Fed in heart, whose flames aspire,"
22710,"As thoughts do blow them, higher and higher."
22711,"Pinch him, fairies, mutually;"
22712,Pinch him for his villainy.
22713,"Pinch him and burn him and turn him about,"
22714,Till candles and starlight and moonshine be out.
22715,"[_During the song they pinch him, and Doctor Caius comes one way and"
22716,steals away a boy in green; and Slender another way takes a boy in
22717,white; Fenton comes in and steals away Anne Page. A noise of hunting is
22718,heard within and all the fairies run away. Falstaff pulls off his
22719,"buck’s head, and rises up._]"
22720,"Enter Page, Ford, Mistress Page and Mistress Ford."
22721,"Nay, do not fly. I think we have watched you now."
22722,Will none but Herne the hunter serve your turn?
22723,"I pray you, come, hold up the jest no higher.—"
22724,"Now, good Sir John, how like you Windsor wives?"
22725,"See you these, husband?"
22726,Do not these fair yokes
22727,Become the forest better than the town?
22728,"Now, sir, who’s a cuckold now? Master Brook, Falstaff’s a knave, a"
22729,"cuckoldly knave. Here are his horns, Master Brook. And, Master Brook,"
22730,"he hath enjoyed nothing of Ford’s but his buck-basket, his cudgel, and"
22731,"twenty pounds of money, which must be paid to Master Brook. His horses"
22732,"are arrested for it, Master Brook."
22733,"Sir John, we have had ill luck, we could never meet. I will never take"
22734,"you for my love again, but I will always count you my deer."
22735,I do begin to perceive that I am made an ass.
22736,"Ay, and an ox too. Both the proofs are extant."
22737,And these are not fairies? I was three or four times in the thought
22738,"they were not fairies; and yet the guiltiness of my mind, the sudden"
22739,"surprise of my powers, drove the grossness of the foppery into a"
22740,"received belief, in despite of the teeth of all rhyme and reason, that"
22741,they were fairies. See now how wit may be made a Jack-a-Lent when ’tis
22742,"Sir John Falstaff, serve Got, and leave your desires, and fairies will"
22743,"Well said, fairy Hugh."
22744,"And leave you your jealousies too, I pray you."
22745,"I will never mistrust my wife again, till thou art able to woo her in"
22746,"Have I laid my brain in the sun, and dried it, that it wants matter to"
22747,prevent so gross o’erreaching as this? Am I ridden with a Welsh goat
22748,too? Shall I have a cox-comb of frieze? ’Tis time I were choked with a
22749,piece of toasted cheese.
22750,Seese is not good to give putter. Your belly is all putter.
22751,“Seese” and “putter”? Have I lived to stand at the taunt of one that
22752,makes fritters of English? This is enough to be the decay of lust and
22753,late-walking through the realm.
22754,"Why, Sir John, do you think, though we would have thrust virtue out of"
22755,"our hearts by the head and shoulders, and have given ourselves without"
22756,"scruple to hell, that ever the devil could have made you our delight?"
22757,"What, a hodge-pudding? A bag of flax?"
22758,"Old, cold, withered, and of intolerable entrails?"
22759,And one that is as slanderous as Satan?
22760,And as poor as Job?
22761,And as wicked as his wife?
22762,"And given to fornications, and to taverns, and sack, and wine, and"
22763,"metheglins, and to drinkings and swearings and starings, pribbles and"
22764,"Well, I am your theme. You have the start of me. I am dejected, I am"
22765,not able to answer the Welsh flannel. Ignorance itself is a plummet
22766,o’er me. Use me as you will.
22767,"Marry, sir, we’ll bring you to Windsor to one Master Brook, that you"
22768,"have cozened of money, to whom you should have been a pander. Over and"
22769,"above that you have suffered, I think to repay that money will be a"
22770,"Yet be cheerful, knight. Thou shalt eat a posset tonight at my house,"
22771,"where I will desire thee to laugh at my wife, that now laughs at thee."
22772,Tell her Master Slender hath married her daughter.
22773,"this, Doctor Caius’ wife."
22774,"Whoa, ho, ho, father Page!"
22775,"Son, how now! How now, son, have you dispatched?"
22776,Dispatched? I’ll make the best in Gloucestershire know on’t. Would I
22777,"were hanged, la, else!"
22778,"I came yonder at Eton to marry Mistress Anne Page, and she’s a great"
22779,"lubberly boy. If it had not been i’ the church, I would have swinged"
22780,"him, or he should have swinged me. If I did not think it had been Anne"
22781,"Page, would I might never stir! And ’tis a postmaster’s boy."
22782,"Upon my life, then, you took the wrong."
22783,"What need you tell me that? I think so, when I took a boy for a girl."
22784,"If I had been married to him, for all he was in woman’s apparel, I"
22785,would not have had him.
22786,"Why, this is your own folly. Did not I tell you how you should know my"
22787,daughter by her garments?
22788,"I went to her in white and cried “mum”, and she cried “budget”, as Anne"
22789,"and I had appointed, and yet it was not Anne, but a postmaster’s boy."
22790,"Good George, be not angry. I knew of your purpose, turned my daughter"
22791,"into green, and indeed she is now with the doctor at the deanery, and"
22792,"Vere is Mistress Page? By gar, I am cozened, I ha’ married _un garçon_,"
22793,"a boy; _un paysan_, by gar, a boy. It is not Anne Page. By gar, I am"
22794,"Why, did you take her in green?"
22795,"Ay, by gar, and ’tis a boy. By gar, I’ll raise all Windsor."
22796,This is strange. Who hath got the right Anne?
22797,Enter Fenton and Anne Page.
22798,"My heart misgives me. Here comes Master Fenton.—How now, Master Fenton!"
22799,"Pardon, good father. Good my mother, pardon."
22800,"Now, mistress, how chance you went not with Master Slender?"
22801,"Why went you not with Master Doctor, maid?"
22802,You do amaze her. Hear the truth of it.
22803,"You would have married her most shamefully,"
22804,Where there was no proportion held in love.
22805,"The truth is, she and I, long since contracted,"
22806,Are now so sure that nothing can dissolve us.
22807,"Th’ offence is holy that she hath committed,"
22808,"And this deceit loses the name of craft,"
22809,"Of disobedience, or unduteous title,"
22810,Since therein she doth evitate and shun
22811,"A thousand irreligious cursed hours,"
22812,Which forced marriage would have brought upon her.
22813,"Stand not amazed, here is no remedy."
22814,"In love, the heavens themselves do guide the state."
22815,"Money buys lands, and wives are sold by fate."
22816,"I am glad, though you have ta’en a special stand to strike at me, that"
22817,your arrow hath glanced.
22818,"Well, what remedy? Fenton, heaven give thee joy!"
22819,What cannot be eschewed must be embraced.
22820,"When night-dogs run, all sorts of deer are chased."
22821,"Well, I will muse no further.—Master Fenton,"
22822,"Heaven give you many, many merry days!"
22823,"Good husband, let us every one go home,"
22824,"And laugh this sport o’er by a country fire,"
22825,Sir John and all.
22826,"Let it be so, Sir John,"
22827,"To Master Brook you yet shall hold your word,"
22828,For he tonight shall lie with Mistress Ford.
22829,A MIDSUMMER NIGHT’S DREAM
22830,Athens. A room in the Palace of Theseus
22831,The Same. A Room in a Cottage
22832,A wood near Athens
22833,Another part of the wood
22834,Another part of the wood
22835,Athens. A Room in Quince’s House
22836,Athens. An Apartment in the Palace of Theseus
22837,"THESEUS, Duke of Athens"
22838,"HIPPOLYTA, Queen of the Amazons, bethrothed to Theseus"
22839,"EGEUS, Father to Hermia"
22840,"HERMIA, daughter to Egeus, in love with Lysander"
22841,"HELENA, in love with Demetrius"
22842,"LYSANDER, in love with Hermia"
22843,"DEMETRIUS, in love with Hermia"
22844,"PHILOSTRATE, Master of the Revels to Theseus"
22845,"OBERON, King of the Fairies"
22846,"TITANIA, Queen of the Fairies"
22847,"PUCK, or ROBIN GOODFELLOW, a Fairy"
22848,"PYRAMUS, THISBE, WALL, MOONSHINE, LION; Characters in the Interlude"
22849,performed by the Clowns
22850,Other Fairies attending their King and Queen
22851,Attendants on Theseus and Hippolyta
22852,"SCENE: Athens, and a wood not far from it"
22853,SCENE I. Athens. A room in the Palace of Theseus
22854,"Enter Theseus, Hippolyta, Philostrate and Attendants."
22855,"Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour"
22856,Draws on apace; four happy days bring in
22857,"Another moon; but oh, methinks, how slow"
22858,"This old moon wanes! She lingers my desires,"
22859,"Like to a step-dame or a dowager,"
22860,Long withering out a young man’s revenue.
22861,Four days will quickly steep themselves in night;
22862,Four nights will quickly dream away the time;
22863,"And then the moon, like to a silver bow"
22864,"New bent in heaven, shall behold the night"
22865,Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments;
22866,Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth;
22867,Turn melancholy forth to funerals;
22868,The pale companion is not for our pomp.
22869,"Hippolyta, I woo’d thee with my sword,"
22870,And won thy love doing thee injuries;
22871,"But I will wed thee in another key,"
22872,"With pomp, with triumph, and with revelling."
22873,"Enter Egeus, Hermia, Lysander and Demetrius."
22874,"Happy be Theseus, our renownèd Duke!"
22875,"Thanks, good Egeus. What’s the news with thee?"
22876,"Full of vexation come I, with complaint"
22877,"Against my child, my daughter Hermia."
22878,"Stand forth, Demetrius. My noble lord,"
22879,This man hath my consent to marry her.
22880,"Stand forth, Lysander. And, my gracious Duke,"
22881,This man hath bewitch’d the bosom of my child.
22882,"Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes,"
22883,And interchang’d love-tokens with my child.
22884,"Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung,"
22885,"With feigning voice, verses of feigning love;"
22886,And stol’n the impression of her fantasy
22887,"With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gauds, conceits,"
22888,"Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats (messengers"
22889,Of strong prevailment in unharden’d youth)
22890,"With cunning hast thou filch’d my daughter’s heart,"
22891,Turn’d her obedience (which is due to me)
22892,"To stubborn harshness. And, my gracious Duke,"
22893,Be it so she will not here before your grace
22894,"Consent to marry with Demetrius,"
22895,I beg the ancient privilege of Athens:
22896,As she is mine I may dispose of her;
22897,Which shall be either to this gentleman
22898,"Or to her death, according to our law"
22899,Immediately provided in that case.
22900,"What say you, Hermia? Be advis’d, fair maid."
22901,To you your father should be as a god;
22902,"One that compos’d your beauties, yea, and one"
22903,To whom you are but as a form in wax
22904,"By him imprinted, and within his power"
22905,"To leave the figure, or disfigure it."
22906,Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.
22907,In himself he is.
22908,"But in this kind, wanting your father’s voice,"
22909,The other must be held the worthier.
22910,I would my father look’d but with my eyes.
22911,Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
22912,I do entreat your Grace to pardon me.
22913,"I know not by what power I am made bold,"
22914,Nor how it may concern my modesty
22915,In such a presence here to plead my thoughts:
22916,But I beseech your Grace that I may know
22917,"The worst that may befall me in this case,"
22918,If I refuse to wed Demetrius.
22919,"Either to die the death, or to abjure"
22920,For ever the society of men.
22921,"Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires,"
22922,"Know of your youth, examine well your blood,"
22923,"Whether, if you yield not to your father’s choice,"
22924,"You can endure the livery of a nun,"
22925,"For aye to be in shady cloister mew’d,"
22926,"To live a barren sister all your life,"
22927,Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.
22928,Thrice-blessèd they that master so their blood
22929,"To undergo such maiden pilgrimage,"
22930,But earthlier happy is the rose distill’d
22931,"Than that which, withering on the virgin thorn,"
22932,"Grows, lives, and dies, in single blessedness."
22933,"So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,"
22934,Ere I will yield my virgin patent up
22935,"Unto his lordship, whose unwishèd yoke"
22936,My soul consents not to give sovereignty.
22937,Take time to pause; and by the next new moon
22938,The sealing-day betwixt my love and me
22939,"For everlasting bond of fellowship,"
22940,Upon that day either prepare to die
22941,"For disobedience to your father’s will,"
22942,"Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would,"
22943,Or on Diana’s altar to protest
22944,For aye austerity and single life.
22945,"Relent, sweet Hermia; and, Lysander, yield"
22946,Thy crazèd title to my certain right.
22947,"You have her father’s love, Demetrius."
22948,Let me have Hermia’s. Do you marry him.
22949,"Scornful Lysander, true, he hath my love;"
22950,And what is mine my love shall render him;
22951,"And she is mine, and all my right of her"
22952,I do estate unto Demetrius.
22953,"I am, my lord, as well deriv’d as he,"
22954,As well possess’d; my love is more than his;
22955,"My fortunes every way as fairly rank’d,"
22956,"If not with vantage, as Demetrius’;"
22957,"And, which is more than all these boasts can be,"
22958,I am belov’d of beauteous Hermia.
22959,Why should not I then prosecute my right?
22960,"Demetrius, I’ll avouch it to his head,"
22961,"Made love to Nedar’s daughter, Helena,"
22962,"And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,"
22963,"Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,"
22964,Upon this spotted and inconstant man.
22965,"I must confess that I have heard so much,"
22966,And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof;
22967,"But, being over-full of self-affairs,"
22968,"My mind did lose it.—But, Demetrius, come,"
22969,"And come, Egeus; you shall go with me."
22970,I have some private schooling for you both.—
22971,"For you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself"
22972,"To fit your fancies to your father’s will,"
22973,Or else the law of Athens yields you up
22974,"To death, or to a vow of single life."
22975,"Come, my Hippolyta. What cheer, my love?"
22976,"Demetrius and Egeus, go along;"
22977,I must employ you in some business
22978,"Against our nuptial, and confer with you"
22979,Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.
22980,With duty and desire we follow you.
22981,"How now, my love? Why is your cheek so pale?"
22982,How chance the roses there do fade so fast?
22983,"Belike for want of rain, which I could well"
22984,Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes.
22985,"Ay me! For aught that I could ever read,"
22986,"Could ever hear by tale or history,"
22987,The course of true love never did run smooth.
22988,But either it was different in blood—
22989,O cross! Too high to be enthrall’d to low.
22990,Or else misgraffèd in respect of years—
22991,O spite! Too old to be engag’d to young.
22992,Or else it stood upon the choice of friends—
22993,O hell! to choose love by another’s eyes!
22994,"Or, if there were a sympathy in choice,"
22995,"War, death, or sickness did lay siege to it,"
22996,"Making it momentany as a sound,"
22997,"Swift as a shadow, short as any dream,"
22998,Brief as the lightning in the collied night
22999,"That, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and earth,"
23000,"And, ere a man hath power to say, ‘Behold!’"
23001,The jaws of darkness do devour it up:
23002,So quick bright things come to confusion.
23003,"If then true lovers have ever cross’d,"
23004,It stands as an edict in destiny.
23005,"Then let us teach our trial patience,"
23006,"Because it is a customary cross,"
23007,"As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,"
23008,"Wishes and tears, poor fancy’s followers."
23009,"A good persuasion; therefore, hear me, Hermia."
23010,"I have a widow aunt, a dowager"
23011,"Of great revenue, and she hath no child."
23012,"From Athens is her house remote seven leagues,"
23013,And she respects me as her only son.
23014,"There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee,"
23015,And to that place the sharp Athenian law
23016,"Cannot pursue us. If thou lovest me then,"
23017,Steal forth thy father’s house tomorrow night;
23018,"And in the wood, a league without the town"
23019,(Where I did meet thee once with Helena
23020,"To do observance to a morn of May),"
23021,There will I stay for thee.
23022,"I swear to thee by Cupid’s strongest bow,"
23023,"By his best arrow with the golden head,"
23024,"By the simplicity of Venus’ doves,"
23025,"By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,"
23026,And by that fire which burn’d the Carthage queen
23027,"When the false Trojan under sail was seen,"
23028,By all the vows that ever men have broke
23029,"In that same place thou hast appointed me,"
23030,Tomorrow truly will I meet with thee.
23031,"Keep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena."
23032,God speed fair Helena! Whither away?
23033,Call you me fair? That fair again unsay.
23034,Demetrius loves your fair. O happy fair!
23035,Your eyes are lode-stars and your tongue’s sweet air
23036,"More tuneable than lark to shepherd’s ear,"
23037,"When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear."
23038,"Sickness is catching. O were favour so,"
23039,"Yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go."
23040,"My ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye,"
23041,My tongue should catch your tongue’s sweet melody.
23042,"Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated,"
23043,The rest I’d give to be to you translated.
23044,"O, teach me how you look, and with what art"
23045,You sway the motion of Demetrius’ heart!
23046,"I frown upon him, yet he loves me still."
23047,O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!
23048,"I give him curses, yet he gives me love."
23049,O that my prayers could such affection move!
23050,"The more I hate, the more he follows me."
23051,"The more I love, the more he hateth me."
23052,"His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine."
23053,None but your beauty; would that fault were mine!
23054,Take comfort: he no more shall see my face;
23055,Lysander and myself will fly this place.
23056,"Before the time I did Lysander see,"
23057,Seem’d Athens as a paradise to me.
23058,"O, then, what graces in my love do dwell,"
23059,That he hath turn’d a heaven into hell!
23060,"Helen, to you our minds we will unfold:"
23061,"Tomorrow night, when Phoebe doth behold"
23062,"Her silver visage in the watery glass,"
23063,Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass
23064,Through Athens’ gates have we devis’d to steal.
23065,And in the wood where often you and I
23066,"Upon faint primrose beds were wont to lie,"
23067,"Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,"
23068,"There my Lysander and myself shall meet,"
23069,"And thence from Athens turn away our eyes,"
23070,To seek new friends and stranger companies.
23071,"Farewell, sweet playfellow. Pray thou for us,"
23072,And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius!
23073,"Keep word, Lysander. We must starve our sight"
23074,"From lovers’ food, till morrow deep midnight."
23075,"I will, my Hermia."
23076,"As you on him, Demetrius dote on you!"
23077,How happy some o’er other some can be!
23078,Through Athens I am thought as fair as she.
23079,But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so;
23080,He will not know what all but he do know.
23081,"And as he errs, doting on Hermia’s eyes,"
23082,"So I, admiring of his qualities."
23083,"Things base and vile, holding no quantity,"
23084,Love can transpose to form and dignity.
23085,"Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind;"
23086,And therefore is wing’d Cupid painted blind.
23087,Nor hath love’s mind of any judgment taste.
23088,"Wings, and no eyes, figure unheedy haste."
23089,"And therefore is love said to be a child,"
23090,Because in choice he is so oft beguil’d.
23091,"As waggish boys in game themselves forswear,"
23092,So the boy Love is perjur’d everywhere.
23093,"For, ere Demetrius look’d on Hermia’s eyne,"
23094,He hail’d down oaths that he was only mine;
23095,"And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,"
23096,"So he dissolv’d, and showers of oaths did melt."
23097,I will go tell him of fair Hermia’s flight.
23098,Then to the wood will he tomorrow night
23099,Pursue her; and for this intelligence
23100,"If I have thanks, it is a dear expense."
23101,"But herein mean I to enrich my pain,"
23102,To have his sight thither and back again.
23103,SCENE II. The Same. A Room in a Cottage
23104,"Enter Quince, Snug, Bottom, Flute, Snout  and Starveling."
23105,Is all our company here?
23106,"You were best to call them generally, man by man, according to the"
23107,"Here is the scroll of every man’s name, which is thought fit through"
23108,"all Athens, to play in our interlude before the Duke and Duchess, on"
23109,his wedding-day at night.
23110,"First, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats on; then read the"
23111,names of the actors; and so grow to a point.
23112,"Marry, our play is _The most lamentable comedy and most cruel death of"
23113,"A very good piece of work, I assure you, and a merry. Now, good Peter"
23114,"Quince, call forth your actors by the scroll. Masters, spread"
23115,"Answer, as I call you. Nick Bottom, the weaver."
23116,"Ready. Name what part I am for, and proceed."
23117,"You, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus."
23118,"What is Pyramus—a lover, or a tyrant?"
23119,"A lover, that kills himself most gallantly for love."
23120,"That will ask some tears in the true performing of it. If I do it, let"
23121,the audience look to their eyes. I will move storms; I will condole in
23122,some measure. To the rest—yet my chief humour is for a tyrant. I could
23123,"play Ercles rarely, or a part to tear a cat in, to make all split."
23124,Shall break the locks
23125,"Shall shine from far,"
23126,And make and mar
23127,"This was lofty. Now name the rest of the players. This is Ercles’ vein,"
23128,a tyrant’s vein; a lover is more condoling.
23129,"Francis Flute, the bellows-mender."
23130,"Flute, you must take Thisbe on you."
23131,What is Thisbe? A wandering knight?
23132,It is the lady that Pyramus must love.
23133,"Nay, faith, let not me play a woman. I have a beard coming."
23134,"That’s all one. You shall play it in a mask, and you may speak as small"
23135,"And I may hide my face, let me play Thisbe too. I’ll speak in a"
23136,"monstrous little voice; ‘Thisne, Thisne!’—‘Ah, Pyramus, my lover dear!"
23137,thy Thisbe dear! and lady dear!’
23138,"No, no, you must play Pyramus; and, Flute, you Thisbe."
23139,"Robin Starveling, the tailor."
23140,"Robin Starveling, you must play Thisbe’s mother."
23141,"Tom Snout, the tinker."
23142,"You, Pyramus’ father; myself, Thisbe’s father;"
23143,"Snug, the joiner, you, the lion’s part. And, I hope here is a play"
23144,"Have you the lion’s part written? Pray you, if it be, give it me, for I"
23145,am slow of study.
23146,"You may do it extempore, for it is nothing but roaring."
23147,"So, so. Farewell; we are gone."
23148,"Thou, traitor, hast set on thy wife to this."
23149,"My child? Away with’t. Even thou, that hast"
23150,"A heart so tender o’er it, take it hence,"
23151,And see it instantly consum’d with fire;
23152,"Even thou, and none but thou. Take it up straight:"
23153,"Within this hour bring me word ’tis done,"
23154,"And by good testimony, or I’ll seize thy life,"
23155,With that thou else call’st thine. If thou refuse
23156,"And wilt encounter with my wrath, say so;"
23157,The bastard brains with these my proper hands
23158,"Shall I dash out. Go, take it to the fire;"
23159,For thou set’st on thy wife.
23160,"I did not, sir:"
23161,"These lords, my noble fellows, if they please,"
23162,Can clear me in ’t.
23163,"We can: my royal liege,"
23164,He is not guilty of her coming hither.
23165,"Beseech your highness, give us better credit:"
23166,We have always truly serv’d you; and beseech
23167,"So to esteem of us. And on our knees we beg,"
23168,As recompense of our dear services
23169,"Past and to come, that you do change this purpose,"
23170,"Which being so horrible, so bloody, must"
23171,Lead on to some foul issue. We all kneel.
23172,I am a feather for each wind that blows.
23173,Shall I live on to see this bastard kneel
23174,And call me father? better burn it now
23175,Than curse it then. But be it; let it live.
23176,"It shall not neither. [_To Antigonus._] You, sir, come you hither,"
23177,You that have been so tenderly officious
23178,"With Lady Margery, your midwife, there,"
23179,"To save this bastard’s life—for ’tis a bastard,"
23180,So sure as this beard’s grey. What will you adventure
23181,To save this brat’s life?
23182,"That my ability may undergo,"
23183,And nobleness impose: at least thus much:
23184,I’ll pawn the little blood which I have left
23185,To save the innocent. Anything possible.
23186,It shall be possible. Swear by this sword
23187,Thou wilt perform my bidding.
23188,"I will, my lord."
23189,"Mark, and perform it, seest thou? for the fail"
23190,Of any point in’t shall not only be
23191,"Death to thyself, but to thy lewd-tongu’d wife,"
23192,"Whom for this time we pardon. We enjoin thee,"
23193,"As thou art liegeman to us, that thou carry"
23194,"This female bastard hence, and that thou bear it"
23195,"To some remote and desert place, quite out"
23196,"Of our dominions; and that there thou leave it,"
23197,"Without more mercy, to it own protection"
23198,And favour of the climate. As by strange fortune
23199,"It came to us, I do in justice charge thee,"
23200,"On thy soul’s peril and thy body’s torture,"
23201,That thou commend it strangely to some place
23202,Where chance may nurse or end it. Take it up.
23203,"I swear to do this, though a present death"
23204,"Had been more merciful. Come on, poor babe:"
23205,Some powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens
23206,"To be thy nurses! Wolves and bears, they say,"
23207,"Casting their savageness aside, have done"
23208,"Like offices of pity. Sir, be prosperous"
23209,In more than this deed does require! And blessing
23210,"Against this cruelty, fight on thy side,"
23211,"Poor thing, condemn’d to loss!"
23212,"No, I’ll not rear"
23213,"Please your highness, posts"
23214,From those you sent to th’ oracle are come
23215,"An hour since: Cleomenes and Dion,"
23216,"Being well arriv’d from Delphos, are both landed,"
23217,Hasting to th’ court.
23218,"So please you, sir, their speed"
23219,Hath been beyond account.
23220,They have been absent: ’tis good speed; foretells
23221,The great Apollo suddenly will have
23222,"The truth of this appear. Prepare you, lords;"
23223,"Summon a session, that we may arraign"
23224,"Our most disloyal lady; for, as she hath"
23225,"Been publicly accus’d, so shall she have"
23226,"A just and open trial. While she lives,"
23227,"My heart will be a burden to me. Leave me,"
23228,And think upon my bidding.
23229,SCENE I. Sicilia. A Street in some Town.
23230,Enter Cleomenes and Dion.
23231,"The climate’s delicate; the air most sweet,"
23232,"Fertile the isle, the temple much surpassing"
23233,The common praise it bears.
23234,"For most it caught me, the celestial habits"
23235,"Of the grave wearers. O, the sacrifice!"
23236,"How ceremonious, solemn, and unearthly,"
23237,It was i’ th’ offering!
23238,"But of all, the burst"
23239,"And the ear-deaf’ning voice o’ th’ oracle,"
23240,"Kin to Jove’s thunder, so surprised my sense"
23241,That I was nothing.
23242,If the event o’ th’ journey
23243,"Prove as successful to the queen,—O, be’t so!—"
23244,"As it hath been to us rare, pleasant, speedy,"
23245,The time is worth the use on’t.
23246,"Turn all to th’ best! These proclamations,"
23247,"So forcing faults upon Hermione,"
23248,The violent carriage of it
23249,"Will clear or end the business: when the oracle,"
23250,"Shall the contents discover, something rare"
23251,Even then will rush to knowledge. Go. Fresh horses!
23252,And gracious be the issue!
23253,SCENE II. The same. A Court of Justice.
23254,"Enter Leontes, Lords and Officers appear, properly seated."
23255,This sessions (to our great grief we pronounce)
23256,Even pushes ’gainst our heart: the party tried
23257,"The daughter of a king, our wife, and one"
23258,Of us too much belov’d. Let us be clear’d
23259,"Of being tyrannous, since we so openly"
23260,"Proceed in justice, which shall have due course,"
23261,Even to the guilt or the purgation.
23262,It is his highness’ pleasure that the queen
23263,Appear in person here in court. Silence!
23264,Hermione is brought in guarded; Paulina and Ladies attending.
23265,"thou art here accused and arraigned of high treason, in committing"
23266,"adultery with Polixenes, king of Bohemia; and conspiring with Camillo"
23267,"to take away the life of our sovereign lord the king, thy royal"
23268,"husband: the pretence whereof being by circumstances partly laid open,"
23269,"thou, Hermione, contrary to the faith and allegiance of a true subject,"
23270,"didst counsel and aid them, for their better safety, to fly away by"
23271,Since what I am to say must be but that
23272,"Which contradicts my accusation, and"
23273,The testimony on my part no other
23274,"But what comes from myself, it shall scarce boot me"
23275,"To say “Not guilty”. Mine integrity,"
23276,"Being counted falsehood, shall, as I express it,"
23277,"Be so receiv’d. But thus, if powers divine"
23278,"Behold our human actions, as they do,"
23279,"I doubt not, then, but innocence shall make"
23280,"False accusation blush, and tyranny"
23281,"Tremble at patience. You, my lord, best know,"
23282,"Who least will seem to do so, my past life"
23283,"Hath been as continent, as chaste, as true,"
23284,As I am now unhappy; which is more
23285,"Than history can pattern, though devis’d"
23286,"And play’d to take spectators. For behold me,"
23287,"A fellow of the royal bed, which owe"
23288,"A moiety of the throne, a great king’s daughter,"
23289,"The mother to a hopeful prince, here standing"
23290,To prate and talk for life and honour ’fore
23291,"Who please to come and hear. For life, I prize it"
23292,"As I weigh grief, which I would spare. For honour,"
23293,"’Tis a derivative from me to mine,"
23294,And only that I stand for. I appeal
23295,"To your own conscience, sir, before Polixenes"
23296,"Came to your court, how I was in your grace,"
23297,"How merited to be so; since he came,"
23298,With what encounter so uncurrent I
23299,Have strain’d t’ appear thus: if one jot beyond
23300,"The bound of honour, or in act or will"
23301,"That way inclining, harden’d be the hearts"
23302,"Of all that hear me, and my near’st of kin"
23303,Cry fie upon my grave!
23304,I ne’er heard yet
23305,That any of these bolder vices wanted
23306,Less impudence to gainsay what they did
23307,Than to perform it first.
23308,"Though ’tis a saying, sir, not due to me."
23309,You will not own it.
23310,More than mistress of
23311,"Which comes to me in name of fault, I must not"
23312,"At all acknowledge. For Polixenes,"
23313,"With whom I am accus’d, I do confess"
23314,"I lov’d him as in honour he requir’d,"
23315,With such a kind of love as might become
23316,"A lady like me; with a love even such,"
23317,"So and no other, as yourself commanded:"
23318,"Which not to have done, I think had been in me"
23319,Both disobedience and ingratitude
23320,"To you and toward your friend, whose love had spoke,"
23321,"Ever since it could speak, from an infant, freely,"
23322,"That it was yours. Now, for conspiracy,"
23323,"I know not how it tastes, though it be dish’d"
23324,For me to try how: all I know of it
23325,Is that Camillo was an honest man;
23326,"And why he left your court, the gods themselves,"
23327,"Wotting no more than I, are ignorant."
23328,"You knew of his departure, as you know"
23329,What you have underta’en to do in ’s absence.
23330,You speak a language that I understand not:
23331,"My life stands in the level of your dreams,"
23332,Which I’ll lay down.
23333,Your actions are my dreams.
23334,"You had a bastard by Polixenes,"
23335,And I but dream’d it. As you were past all shame
23336,Which to deny concerns more than avails; for as
23337,"Thy brat hath been cast out, like to itself,"
23338,"No father owning it (which is, indeed,"
23339,"More criminal in thee than it), so thou"
23340,Shalt feel our justice; in whose easiest passage
23341,Look for no less than death.
23342,"Sir, spare your threats:"
23343,"The bug which you would fright me with, I seek."
23344,To me can life be no commodity.
23345,"The crown and comfort of my life, your favour,"
23346,"I do give lost, for I do feel it gone,"
23347,"But know not how it went. My second joy,"
23348,"And first-fruits of my body, from his presence"
23349,"I am barr’d, like one infectious. My third comfort,"
23350,"Starr’d most unluckily, is from my breast,"
23351,Hal’d out to murder; myself on every post
23352,Proclaim’d a strumpet; with immodest hatred
23353,"The child-bed privilege denied, which ’longs"
23354,"To women of all fashion; lastly, hurried"
23355,"Here to this place, i’ th’ open air, before"
23356,"I have got strength of limit. Now, my liege,"
23357,"Tell me what blessings I have here alive,"
23358,That I should fear to die. Therefore proceed.
23359,"But yet hear this: mistake me not: no life,"
23360,"I prize it not a straw, but for mine honour,"
23361,"Which I would free, if I shall be condemn’d"
23362,"Upon surmises, all proofs sleeping else"
23363,"But what your jealousies awake, I tell you"
23364,"’Tis rigour, and not law. Your honours all,"
23365,I do refer me to the oracle:
23366,Apollo be my judge!
23367,"Is altogether just: therefore bring forth,"
23368,"And in Apollo’s name, his oracle:"
23369,The Emperor of Russia was my father.
23370,"O that he were alive, and here beholding"
23371,His daughter’s trial! that he did but see
23372,The flatness of my misery; yet with eyes
23373,"Of pity, not revenge!"
23374,Enter Officers with Cleomenes and Dion.
23375,"You here shall swear upon this sword of justice,"
23376,"That you, Cleomenes and Dion, have"
23377,"Been both at Delphos, and from thence have brought"
23378,"This seal’d-up oracle, by the hand deliver’d"
23379,Of great Apollo’s priest; and that since then
23380,"You have not dared to break the holy seal,"
23381,Nor read the secrets in’t.
23382,All this we swear.
23383,Break up the seals and read.
23384,subject; Leontes a jealous tyrant; his innocent babe truly begotten;
23385,"and the king shall live without an heir, if that which is lost be not"
23386,Now blessed be the great Apollo!
23387,Hast thou read truth?
23388,"Ay, my lord, even so"
23389,As it is here set down.
23390,There is no truth at all i’ th’ oracle:
23391,The sessions shall proceed: this is mere falsehood.
23392,Enter a Servant hastily.
23393,"My lord the king, the king!"
23394,What is the business?
23395,"O sir, I shall be hated to report it."
23396,"The prince your son, with mere conceit and fear"
23397,"Of the queen’s speed, is gone."
23398,"Apollo’s angry, and the heavens themselves"
23399,Do strike at my injustice.
23400,This news is mortal to the queen. Look down
23401,And see what death is doing.
23402,Her heart is but o’ercharg’d; she will recover.
23403,I have too much believ’d mine own suspicion.
23404,Beseech you tenderly apply to her
23405,Some remedies for life.
23406,My great profaneness ’gainst thine oracle!
23407,"I’ll reconcile me to Polixenes,"
23408,"New woo my queen,	 recall the good Camillo,"
23409,"Whom I proclaim a man of truth, of mercy;"
23410,"For, being transported by my jealousies"
23411,"To bloody thoughts and to revenge, I chose"
23412,Camillo for the minister to poison
23413,"My friend Polixenes: which had been done,"
23414,But that the good mind of Camillo tardied
23415,"My swift command, though I with death and with"
23416,"Reward did threaten and encourage him,"
23417,"Not doing it and being done. He, most humane"
23418,"And fill’d with honour, to my kingly guest"
23419,"Unclasp’d my practice, quit his fortunes here,"
23420,"Which you knew great, and to the certain hazard"
23421,"Of all incertainties himself commended,"
23422,No richer than his honour. How he glisters
23423,Thorough my rust! And how his piety
23424,Does my deeds make the blacker!
23425,"O, cut my lace, lest my heart, cracking it,"
23426,"What fit is this, good lady?"
23427,"What studied torments, tyrant, hast for me?"
23428,What wheels? racks? fires? what flaying? boiling
23429,In leads or oils? What old or newer torture
23430,"Must I receive, whose every word deserves"
23431,"To taste of thy most worst? Thy tyranny,"
23432,"Together working with thy jealousies,"
23433,"Fancies too weak for boys, too green and idle"
23434,"For girls of nine. O, think what they have done,"
23435,"And then run mad indeed, stark mad! for all"
23436,Thy by-gone fooleries were but spices of it.
23437,"That thou betray’dst Polixenes, ’twas nothing;"
23438,"That did but show thee, of a fool, inconstant"
23439,And damnable ingrateful; nor was’t much
23440,"Thou wouldst have poison’d good Camillo’s honour,"
23441,"To have him kill a king; poor trespasses,"
23442,More monstrous standing by: whereof I reckon
23443,"The casting forth to crows thy baby daughter,"
23444,"To be or none or little, though a devil"
23445,"Would have shed water out of fire ere done’t,"
23446,Nor is’t directly laid to thee the death
23447,"Of the young prince, whose honourable thoughts,"
23448,"Thoughts high for one so tender, cleft the heart"
23449,That could conceive a gross and foolish sire
23450,"Blemish’d his gracious dam: this is not, no,"
23451,"Laid to thy answer: but the last—O lords,"
23452,"When I have said, cry Woe!—the queen, the queen,"
23453,"The sweet’st, dear’st creature’s dead, and vengeance for’t"
23454,Not dropp’d down yet.
23455,The higher powers forbid!
23456,I say she’s dead: I’ll swear’t. If word nor oath
23457,"Prevail not, go and see: if you can bring"
23458,"Tincture, or lustre, in her lip, her eye,"
23459,"Heat outwardly or breath within, I’ll serve you"
23460,"As I would do the gods. But, O thou tyrant!"
23461,"Do not repent these things, for they are heavier"
23462,Than all thy woes can stir. Therefore betake thee
23463,To nothing but despair. A thousand knees
23464,"Ten thousand years together, naked, fasting,"
23465,"Upon a barren mountain, and still winter"
23466,"In storm perpetual, could not move the gods"
23467,To look that way thou wert.
23468,"Go on, go on:"
23469,Thou canst not speak too much; I have deserv’d
23470,All tongues to talk their bitterest.
23471,"Howe’er the business goes, you have made fault"
23472,I’ th’ boldness of your speech.
23473,I am sorry for ’t:
23474,"All faults I make, when I shall come to know them,"
23475,"I do repent. Alas, I have show’d too much"
23476,The rashness of a woman: he is touch’d
23477,"To th’ noble heart. What’s gone and what’s past help,"
23478,Should be past grief. Do not receive affliction
23479,"At my petition; I beseech you, rather"
23480,"Let me be punish’d, that have minded you"
23481,"Of what you should forget. Now, good my liege,"
23482,"Sir, royal sir, forgive a foolish woman:"
23483,"The love I bore your queen—lo, fool again!"
23484,"I’ll speak of her no more, nor of your children."
23485,"I’ll not remember you of my own lord,"
23486,"Who is lost too. Take your patience to you,"
23487,And I’ll say nothing.
23488,Thou didst speak but well
23489,"When most the truth, which I receive much better"
23490,"Than to be pitied of thee. Prithee, bring me"
23491,To the dead bodies of my queen and son:
23492,One grave shall be for both. Upon them shall
23493,"The causes of their death appear, unto"
23494,Our shame perpetual. Once a day I’ll visit
23495,"The chapel where they lie, and tears shed there"
23496,Shall be my recreation. So long as nature
23497,"Will bear up with this exercise, so long"
23498,"I daily vow to use it. Come, and lead me"
23499,SCENE III. Bohemia. A desert Country near the Sea.
23500,Enter Antigonus with the Child and a Mariner.
23501,"Thou art perfect, then, our ship hath touch’d upon"
23502,The deserts of Bohemia?
23503,"Ay, my lord, and fear"
23504,"We have landed in ill time: the skies look grimly,"
23505,"And threaten present blusters. In my conscience,"
23506,"The heavens with that we have in hand are angry,"
23507,And frown upon ’s.
23508,"Their sacred wills be done! Go, get aboard;"
23509,Look to thy bark: I’ll not be long before
23510,I call upon thee.
23511,"Make your best haste, and go not"
23512,Too far i’ th’ land: ’tis like to be loud weather;
23513,"Besides, this place is famous for the creatures"
23514,Of prey that keep upon ’t.
23515,I am glad at heart
23516,To be so rid o’ th’ business.
23517,"I have heard, but not believ’d, the spirits of the dead"
23518,"May walk again: if such thing be, thy mother"
23519,Appear’d to me last night; for ne’er was dream
23520,"So like a waking. To me comes a creature,"
23521,"Sometimes her head on one side, some another."
23522,"I never saw a vessel of like sorrow,"
23523,"So fill’d and so becoming: in pure white robes,"
23524,"Like very sanctity, she did approach"
23525,"My cabin where I lay: thrice bow’d before me,"
23526,"And, gasping to begin some speech, her eyes"
23527,"Became two spouts. The fury spent, anon"
23528,"Did this break from her: “Good Antigonus,"
23529,"Since fate, against thy better disposition,"
23530,Hath made thy person for the thrower-out
23531,"Of my poor babe, according to thine oath,"
23532,"Places remote enough are in Bohemia,"
23533,"There weep, and leave it crying. And, for the babe"
23534,"Is counted lost for ever, Perdita"
23535,"I prithee call’t. For this ungentle business,"
23536,"Put on thee by my lord, thou ne’er shalt see"
23537,"Thy wife Paulina more.” And so, with shrieks,"
23538,"She melted into air. Affrighted much,"
23539,I did in time collect myself and thought
23540,"This was so, and no slumber. Dreams are toys,"
23541,"Yet for this once, yea, superstitiously,"
23542,I will be squar’d by this. I do believe
23543,"Hermione hath suffer’d death, and that"
23544,"Apollo would, this being indeed the issue"
23545,"Of King Polixenes, it should here be laid,"
23546,"Either for life or death, upon the earth"
23547,"Of its right father. Blossom, speed thee well! There lie; and there thy"
23548,"Which may if fortune please, both breed thee, pretty,"
23549,"And still rest thine. The storm begins: poor wretch,"
23550,That for thy mother’s fault art thus expos’d
23551,"To loss and what may follow! Weep I cannot,"
23552,"But my heart bleeds, and most accurs’d am I"
23553,To be by oath enjoin’d to this. Farewell!
23554,The day frowns more and more. Thou’rt like to have
23555,A lullaby too rough. I never saw
23556,The heavens so dim by day. A savage clamour!
23557,Well may I get aboard! This is the chase:
23558,I am gone for ever.
23559,Enter an old Shepherd.
23560,"I would there were no age between ten and three-and-twenty, or that"
23561,youth would sleep out the rest; for there is nothing in the between but
23562,"getting wenches with child, wronging the ancientry, stealing,"
23563,fighting—Hark you now! Would any but these boiled brains of nineteen
23564,and two-and-twenty hunt this weather? They have scared away two of my
23565,"best sheep, which I fear the wolf will sooner find than the master: if"
23566,"anywhere I have them, ’tis by the sea-side, browsing of ivy. Good luck,"
23567,"an ’t be thy will, what have we here?"
23568,"Mercy on ’s, a bairn! A very pretty bairn! A boy or a child, I wonder?"
23569,"A pretty one; a very pretty one. Sure, some scape. Though I am not"
23570,"bookish, yet I can read waiting-gentlewoman in the scape. This has"
23571,"been some stair-work, some trunk-work, some behind-door-work. They"
23572,were warmer that got this than the poor thing is here. I’ll take it up
23573,for pity: yet I’ll tarry till my son come; he halloed but even now.
23574,"What, art so near? If thou’lt see a thing to talk on when thou art dead"
23575,"and rotten, come hither. What ail’st thou, man?"
23576,"I have seen two such sights, by sea and by land! But I am not to say it"
23577,"is a sea, for it is now the sky: betwixt the firmament and it, you"
23578,cannot thrust a bodkin’s point.
23579,"Why, boy, how is it?"
23580,"I would you did but see how it chafes, how it rages, how it takes up"
23581,"the shore! But that’s not to the point. O, the most piteous cry of the"
23582,"poor souls! sometimes to see ’em, and not to see ’em. Now the ship"
23583,"boring the moon with her mainmast, and anon swallowed with yest and"
23584,"froth, as you’d thrust a cork into a hogshead. And then for the land"
23585,"service, to see how the bear tore out his shoulder-bone, how he cried"
23586,"to me for help, and said his name was Antigonus, a nobleman. But to"
23587,"make an end of the ship, to see how the sea flap-dragon’d it: but"
23588,"first, how the poor souls roared, and the sea mocked them, and how the"
23589,"poor gentleman roared, and the bear mocked him, both roaring louder"
23590,than the sea or weather.
23591,"Name of mercy, when was this, boy?"
23592,"Now, now. I have not winked since I saw these sights: the men are not"
23593,"yet cold under water, nor the bear half dined on the gentleman. He’s at"
23594,Would I had been by to have helped the old man!
23595,"I would you had been by the ship side, to have helped her: there your"
23596,charity would have lacked footing.
23597,"Heavy matters, heavy matters! But look thee here, boy. Now bless"
23598,"thyself: thou met’st with things dying, I with things new-born. Here’s"
23599,"a sight for thee. Look thee, a bearing-cloth for a squire’s child! Look"
23600,"thee here; take up, take up, boy; open’t. So, let’s see. It was told me"
23601,I should be rich by the fairies. This is some changeling: open’t.
23602,"You’re a made old man. If the sins of your youth are forgiven you,"
23603,you’re well to live. Gold! all gold!
23604,"This is fairy gold, boy, and ’twill prove so. Up with it, keep it"
23605,"close: home, home, the next way. We are lucky, boy, and to be so still"
23606,"requires nothing but secrecy. Let my sheep go: come, good boy, the next"
23607,Go you the next way with your findings. I’ll go see if the bear be gone
23608,"from the gentleman, and how much he hath eaten. They are never curst"
23609,"but when they are hungry: if there be any of him left, I’ll bury it."
23610,That’s a good deed. If thou mayest discern by that which is left of him
23611,"what he is, fetch me to th’ sight of him."
23612,"Marry, will I; and you shall help to put him i’ th’ ground."
23613,"’Tis a lucky day, boy, and we’ll do good deeds on ’t."
23614,"Enter Time, the Chorus."
23615,"I that please some, try all: both joy and terror"
23616,"Of good and bad, that makes and unfolds error,"
23617,"Now take upon me, in the name of Time,"
23618,To use my wings. Impute it not a crime
23619,"To me or my swift passage, that I slide"
23620,"O’er sixteen years, and leave the growth untried"
23621,"Of that wide gap, since it is in my power"
23622,"To o’erthrow law, and in one self-born hour"
23623,To plant and o’erwhelm custom. Let me pass
23624,"The same I am, ere ancient’st order was"
23625,Or what is now received. I witness to
23626,The times that brought them in; so shall I do
23627,"To th’ freshest things now reigning, and make stale"
23628,"The glistering of this present, as my tale"
23629,"Now seems to it. Your patience this allowing,"
23630,"I turn my glass, and give my scene such growing"
23631,As you had slept between. Leontes leaving
23632,"Th’ effects of his fond jealousies, so grieving"
23633,"That he shuts up himself, imagine me,"
23634,"Gentle spectators, that I now may be"
23635,"In fair Bohemia, and remember well,"
23636,"I mentioned a son o’ th’ king’s, which Florizel"
23637,I now name to you; and with speed so pace
23638,"To speak of Perdita, now grown in grace"
23639,Equal with wondering. What of her ensues
23640,I list not prophesy; but let Time’s news
23641,"Be known when ’tis brought forth. A shepherd’s daughter,"
23642,"And what to her adheres, which follows after,"
23643,"Is th’ argument of Time. Of this allow,"
23644,If ever you have spent time worse ere now;
23645,"If never, yet that Time himself doth say"
23646,He wishes earnestly you never may.
23647,SCENE II. Bohemia. A Room in the palace of Polixenes.
23648,Enter Polixenes and Camillo.
23649,"I pray thee, good Camillo, be no more importunate: ’tis a sickness"
23650,denying thee anything; a death to grant this.
23651,It is fifteen years since I saw my country. Though I have for the most
23652,"part been aired abroad, I desire to lay my bones there. Besides, the"
23653,"penitent king, my master, hath sent for me; to whose feeling sorrows I"
23654,"might be some allay, or I o’erween to think so,—which is another spur"
23655,"As thou lov’st me, Camillo, wipe not out the rest of thy services by"
23656,"leaving me now: the need I have of thee, thine own goodness hath made;"
23657,"better not to have had thee than thus to want thee. Thou, having made"
23658,"me businesses which none without thee can sufficiently manage, must"
23659,"either stay to execute them thyself, or take away with thee the very"
23660,"services thou hast done, which if I have not enough considered (as too"
23661,much I cannot) to be more thankful to thee shall be my study; and my
23662,"profit therein the heaping friendships. Of that fatal country Sicilia,"
23663,prithee speak no more; whose very naming punishes me with the
23664,"remembrance of that penitent, as thou call’st him, and reconciled king,"
23665,my brother; whose loss of his most precious queen and children are even
23666,"now to be afresh lamented. Say to me, when sawest thou the Prince"
23667,"Florizel, my son? Kings are no less unhappy, their issue not being"
23668,"gracious, than they are in losing them when they have approved their"
23669,"Sir, it is three days since I saw the prince. What his happier affairs"
23670,"may be, are to me unknown, but I have missingly noted he is of late"
23671,"much retired from court, and is less frequent to his princely exercises"
23672,than formerly he hath appeared.
23673,"I have considered so much, Camillo, and with some care; so far that I"
23674,have eyes under my service which look upon his removedness; from whom I
23675,"have this intelligence, that he is seldom from the house of a most"
23676,"homely shepherd, a man, they say, that from very nothing, and beyond"
23677,"the imagination of his neighbours, is grown into an unspeakable estate."
23678,"I have heard, sir, of such a man, who hath a daughter of most rare"
23679,note: the report of her is extended more than can be thought to begin
23680,from such a cottage.
23681,"That’s likewise part of my intelligence: but, I fear, the angle that"
23682,"plucks our son thither. Thou shalt accompany us to the place, where we"
23683,"will, not appearing what we are, have some question with the shepherd;"
23684,from whose simplicity I think it not uneasy to get the cause of my
23685,"son’s resort thither. Prithee, be my present partner in this business,"
23686,and lay aside the thoughts of Sicilia.
23687,I willingly obey your command.
23688,My best Camillo! We must disguise ourselves.
23689,SCENE III. The same. A Road near the Shepherd’s cottage.
23690,"_When daffodils begin to peer,"
23691,"With, hey! the doxy over the dale,"
23692,"Why, then comes in the sweet o’ the year,"
23693,For the red blood reigns in the winter’s pale._
23694,"_The white sheet bleaching on the hedge,"
23695,"With, hey! the sweet birds, O, how they sing!"
23696,Doth set my pugging tooth on edge;
23697,For a quart of ale is a dish for a king._
23698,"_The lark, that tirra-lirra chants,"
23699,"With, hey! with, hey! the thrush and the jay,"
23700,"Are summer songs for me and my aunts,"
23701,While we lie tumbling in the hay._
23702,"I have served Prince Florizel, and in my time wore three-pile, but now"
23703,I am out of service.
23704,"_But shall I go mourn for that, my dear?"
23705,The pale moon shines by night:
23706,"And when I wander here and there,"
23707,I then do most go right._
23708,"_If tinkers may have leave to live,"
23709,"And bear the sow-skin budget,"
23710,Then my account I well may give
23711,And in the stocks avouch it._
23712,"My traffic is sheets; when the kite builds, look to lesser linen. My"
23713,"father named me Autolycus; who being, I as am, littered under Mercury,"
23714,was likewise a snapper-up of unconsidered trifles. With die and drab I
23715,"purchased this caparison, and my revenue is the silly cheat. Gallows"
23716,and knock are too powerful on the highway. Beating and hanging are
23717,"terrors to me. For the life to come, I sleep out the thought of it. A"
23718,Let me see: every ’leven wether tods; every tod yields pound and odd
23719,"shilling; fifteen hundred shorn, what comes the wool to?"
23720,I cannot do’t without counters. Let me see; what am I to buy for our
23721,"sheep-shearing feast? “Three pound of sugar, five pound of currants,"
23722,rice”—what will this sister of mine do with rice? But my father hath
23723,"made her mistress of the feast, and she lays it on. She hath made me"
23724,"four-and-twenty nosegays for the shearers, three-man song-men all, and"
23725,"very good ones; but they are most of them means and basses, but one"
23726,"puritan amongst them, and he sings psalms to hornpipes. I must have"
23727,"saffron to colour the warden pies; “mace; dates”, none, that’s out of"
23728,"my note; “nutmegs, seven; a race or two of ginger”, but that I may beg;"
23729,"“four pound of prunes, and as many of raisins o’ th’ sun.”"
23730,I’ th’ name of me!
23731,"O, help me, help me! Pluck but off these rags; and then, death, death!"
23732,"Alack, poor soul! thou hast need of more rags to lay on thee, rather"
23733,than have these off.
23734,"O sir, the loathsomeness of them offends me more than the stripes I"
23735,"have received, which are mighty ones and millions."
23736,"Alas, poor man! a million of beating may come to a great matter."
23737,"I am robbed, sir, and beaten; my money and apparel ta’en from me, and"
23738,these detestable things put upon me.
23739,"What, by a horseman or a footman?"
23740,"A footman, sweet sir, a footman."
23741,"Indeed, he should be a footman by the garments he has left with thee:"
23742,"if this be a horseman’s coat, it hath seen very hot service. Lend me"
23743,"thy hand, I’ll help thee: come, lend me thy hand."
23744,"O, good sir, tenderly, O!"
23745,"O, good sir, softly, good sir. I fear, sir, my shoulder blade is out."
23746,How now! canst stand?
23747,"Softly, dear sir! [_Picks his pocket._] good sir, softly. You ha’ done"
23748,me a charitable office.
23749,Dost lack any money? I have a little money for thee.
23750,"No, good sweet sir; no, I beseech you, sir: I have a kinsman not past"
23751,"three-quarters of a mile hence, unto whom I was going. I shall there"
23752,"have money or anything I want. Offer me no money, I pray you; that"
23753,What manner of fellow was he that robbed you?
23754,"A fellow, sir, that I have known to go about with troll-my-dames. I"
23755,"knew him once a servant of the prince; I cannot tell, good sir, for"
23756,"which of his virtues it was, but he was certainly whipped out of the"
23757,"His vices, you would say; there’s no virtue whipped out of the court."
23758,They cherish it to make it stay there; and yet it will no more but
23759,"Vices, I would say, sir. I know this man well. He hath been since an"
23760,"ape-bearer, then a process-server, a bailiff. Then he compassed a"
23761,"motion of the Prodigal Son, and married a tinker’s wife within a mile"
23762,"where my land and living lies; and, having flown over many knavish"
23763,"professions, he settled only in rogue. Some call him Autolycus."
23764,"Out upon him! prig, for my life, prig: he haunts wakes, fairs, and"
23765,"Very true, sir; he, sir, he; that’s the rogue that put me into this"
23766,Not a more cowardly rogue in all Bohemia. If you had but looked big and
23767,"spit at him, he’d have run."
23768,"I must confess to you, sir, I am no fighter. I am false of heart that"
23769,"way; and that he knew, I warrant him."
23770,How do you now?
23771,"Sweet sir, much better than I was. I can stand and walk: I will even"
23772,take my leave of you and pace softly towards my kinsman’s.
23773,Shall I bring thee on the way?
23774,"No, good-faced sir; no, sweet sir."
23775,Then fare thee well. I must go buy spices for our sheep-shearing.
23776,"Prosper you, sweet sir!"
23777,Your purse is not hot enough to purchase your spice. I’ll be with you
23778,at your sheep-shearing too. If I make not this cheat bring out
23779,"another, and the shearers prove sheep, let me be unrolled, and my name"
23780,put in the book of virtue!
23781,"_Jog on, jog on, the footpath way,"
23782,And merrily hent the stile-a:
23783,"A merry heart goes all the day,"
23784,Your sad tires in a mile-a._
23785,SCENE IV. The same. A Shepherd’s Cottage.
23786,Enter Florizel and Perdita.
23787,These your unusual weeds to each part of you
23788,"Do give a life, no shepherdess, but Flora"
23789,Peering in April’s front. This your sheep-shearing
23790,"Is as a meeting of the petty gods,"
23791,And you the queen on ’t.
23792,"Sir, my gracious lord,"
23793,To chide at your extremes it not becomes me;
23794,"O, pardon that I name them! Your high self,"
23795,"The gracious mark o’ th’ land, you have obscur’d"
23796,"With a swain’s wearing, and me, poor lowly maid,"
23797,Most goddess-like prank’d up. But that our feasts
23798,"In every mess have folly, and the feeders"
23799,"Digest it with a custom, I should blush"
23800,"To see you so attir’d; swoon, I think,"
23801,To show myself a glass.
23802,I bless the time
23803,When my good falcon made her flight across
23804,Now Jove afford you cause!
23805,To me the difference forges dread. Your greatness
23806,Hath not been us’d to fear. Even now I tremble
23807,"To think your father, by some accident,"
23808,"Should pass this way, as you did. O, the Fates!"
23809,"How would he look to see his work, so noble,"
23810,Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
23811,"Should I, in these my borrow’d flaunts, behold"
23812,The sternness of his presence?
23813,"Nothing but jollity. The gods themselves,"
23814,"Humbling their deities to love, have taken"
23815,The shapes of beasts upon them. Jupiter
23816,Became a bull and bellow’d; the green Neptune
23817,"A ram and bleated; and the fire-rob’d god,"
23818,"Golden Apollo, a poor humble swain,"
23819,As I seem now. Their transformations
23820,"Were never for a piece of beauty rarer,"
23821,"Nor in a way so chaste, since my desires"
23822,"Run not before mine honour, nor my lusts"
23823,Burn hotter than my faith.
23824,Your resolution cannot hold when ’tis
23825,"Oppos’d, as it must be, by the power of the king:"
23826,"One of these two must be necessities,"
23827,"Which then will speak, that you must change this purpose,"
23828,Or I my life.
23829,"With these forc’d thoughts, I prithee, darken not"
23830,"The mirth o’ th’ feast. Or I’ll be thine, my fair,"
23831,Or not my father’s. For I cannot be
23832,"Mine own, nor anything to any, if"
23833,"I be not thine. To this I am most constant,"
23834,"Though destiny say no. Be merry, gentle."
23835,Strangle such thoughts as these with anything
23836,That you behold the while. Your guests are coming:
23837,"Lift up your countenance, as it were the day"
23838,Of celebration of that nuptial which
23839,We two have sworn shall come.
23840,"See, your guests approach:"
23841,"Address yourself to entertain them sprightly,"
23842,And let’s be red with mirth.
23843,"Enter Shepherd with Polixenes and Camillo, disguised; Clown, Mopsa,"
23844,"Fie, daughter! When my old wife liv’d, upon"
23845,"This day she was both pantler, butler, cook,"
23846,Both dame and servant; welcom’d all; serv’d all;
23847,Would sing her song and dance her turn; now here
23848,"At upper end o’ th’ table, now i’ th’ middle;"
23849,"On his shoulder, and his; her face o’ fire"
23850,"With labour, and the thing she took to quench it"
23851,"She would to each one sip. You are retired,"
23852,"As if you were a feasted one, and not"
23853,"The hostess of the meeting: pray you, bid"
23854,"These unknown friends to ’s welcome, for it is"
23855,"A way to make us better friends, more known."
23856,"Come, quench your blushes, and present yourself"
23857,"That which you are, mistress o’ th’ feast. Come on,"
23858,"And bid us welcome to your sheep-shearing,"
23859,As your good flock shall prosper.
23860,It is my father’s will I should take on me
23861,The hostess-ship o’ the day.
23862,"Give me those flowers there, Dorcas. Reverend sirs,"
23863,For you there’s rosemary and rue; these keep
23864,Seeming and savour all the winter long.
23865,Grace and remembrance be to you both!
23866,And welcome to our shearing!
23867,A fair one are you—well you fit our ages
23868,With flowers of winter.
23869,"Sir, the year growing ancient,"
23870,Not yet on summer’s death nor on the birth
23871,"Of trembling winter, the fairest flowers o’ th’ season"
23872,"Are our carnations and streak’d gillyvors,"
23873,Which some call nature’s bastards: of that kind
23874,Our rustic garden’s barren; and I care not
23875,To get slips of them.
23876,Do you neglect them?
23877,For I have heard it said
23878,"There is an art which, in their piedness, shares"
23879,With great creating nature.
23880,Yet nature is made better by no mean
23881,"But nature makes that mean. So, over that art"
23882,"Which you say adds to nature, is an art"
23883,"That nature makes. You see, sweet maid, we marry"
23884,"A gentler scion to the wildest stock,"
23885,And make conceive a bark of baser kind
23886,By bud of nobler race. This is an art
23887,"Which does mend nature, change it rather, but"
23888,The art itself is nature.
23889,"Then make your garden rich in gillyvors,"
23890,And do not call them bastards.
23891,The dibble in earth to set one slip of them;
23892,"No more than, were I painted, I would wish"
23893,"This youth should say ’twere well, and only therefore"
23894,Desire to breed by me. Here’s flowers for you:
23895,"Hot lavender, mints, savory, marjoram,"
23896,"The marigold, that goes to bed with th’ sun"
23897,And with him rises weeping. These are flowers
23898,"Of middle summer, and I think they are given"
23899,To men of middle age. You’re very welcome.
23900,"I should leave grazing, were I of your flock,"
23901,And only live by gazing.
23902,You’d be so lean that blasts of January
23903,"Would blow you through and through. [_To Florizel_] Now, my fair’st"
23904,"I would I had some flowers o’ th’ spring, that might"
23905,"Become your time of day; and yours, and yours,"
23906,That wear upon your virgin branches yet
23907,"Your maidenheads growing. O Proserpina,"
23908,"From the flowers now that, frighted, thou let’st fall"
23909,"From Dis’s waggon! daffodils,"
23910,"That come before the swallow dares, and take"
23911,"The winds of March with beauty; violets dim,"
23912,But sweeter than the lids of Juno’s eyes
23913,"Or Cytherea’s breath; pale primroses,"
23914,That die unmarried ere they can behold
23915,Bright Phoebus in his strength (a malady
23916,Most incident to maids); bold oxlips and
23917,"The crown imperial; lilies of all kinds,"
23918,"The flower-de-luce being one. O, these I lack,"
23919,"To make you garlands of; and my sweet friend,"
23920,To strew him o’er and o’er!
23921,"What, like a corse?"
23922,"No, like a bank for love to lie and play on;"
23923,"Not like a corse; or if, not to be buried,"
23924,"But quick, and in mine arms. Come, take your flowers."
23925,Methinks I play as I have seen them do
23926,In Whitsun pastorals. Sure this robe of mine
23927,Does change my disposition.
23928,"Still betters what is done. When you speak, sweet,"
23929,"I’d have you do it ever. When you sing,"
23930,"I’d have you buy and sell so, so give alms,"
23931,"Pray so; and, for the ord’ring your affairs,"
23932,"To sing them too. When you do dance, I wish you"
23933,"A wave o’ th’ sea, that you might ever do"
23934,"Nothing but that, move still, still so,"
23935,"And own no other function. Each your doing,"
23936,"So singular in each particular,"
23937,"Crowns what you are doing in the present deeds,"
23938,That all your acts are queens.
23939,"Your praises are too large. But that your youth,"
23940,"And the true blood which peeps fairly through ’t,"
23941,"Do plainly give you out an unstained shepherd,"
23942,"With wisdom I might fear, my Doricles,"
23943,You woo’d me the false way.
23944,I think you have
23945,As little skill to fear as I have purpose
23946,"To put you to ’t. But, come; our dance, I pray."
23947,"Your hand, my Perdita. So turtles pair"
23948,That never mean to part.
23949,I’ll swear for ’em.
23950,This is the prettiest low-born lass that ever
23951,Ran on the green-sward. Nothing she does or seems
23952,"But smacks of something greater than herself,"
23953,Too noble for this place.
23954,He tells her something
23955,"That makes her blood look out. Good sooth, she is"
23956,The queen of curds and cream.
23957,"Come on, strike up."
23958,"Mopsa must be your mistress: marry, garlic, to mend her kissing with!"
23959,"Now, in good time!"
23960,"Not a word, a word; we stand upon our manners."
23961,"Pray, good shepherd, what fair swain is this"
23962,Which dances with your daughter?
23963,They call him Doricles; and boasts himself
23964,To have a worthy feeding. But I have it
23965,"Upon his own report, and I believe it."
23966,He looks like sooth. He says he loves my daughter.
23967,I think so too; for never gaz’d the moon
23968,"Upon the water as he’ll stand and read,"
23969,"As ’twere, my daughter’s eyes. And, to be plain,"
23970,I think there is not half a kiss to choose
23971,Who loves another best.
23972,"So she does anything, though I report it"
23973,That should be silent. If young Doricles
23974,"Do light upon her, she shall bring him that"
23975,Which he not dreams of.
23976,"O master, if you did but hear the pedlar at the door, you would never"
23977,"dance again after a tabor and pipe; no, the bagpipe could not move you."
23978,He sings several tunes faster than you’ll tell money. He utters them as
23979,"he had eaten ballads, and all men’s ears grew to his tunes."
23980,He could never come better: he shall come in. I love a ballad but even
23981,"too well, if it be doleful matter merrily set down, or a very pleasant"
23982,thing indeed and sung lamentably.
23983,He hath songs for man or woman of all sizes. No milliner can so fit his
23984,"customers with gloves. He has the prettiest love-songs for maids, so"
23985,"without bawdry, which is strange; with such delicate burdens of dildos"
23986,"and fadings, “jump her and thump her”; and where some stretch-mouthed"
23987,"rascal would, as it were, mean mischief and break a foul gap into the"
23988,"matter, he makes the maid to answer “Whoop, do me no harm, good man”;"
23989,"puts him off, slights him, with “Whoop, do me no harm, good man.”"
23990,This is a brave fellow.
23991,"Believe me, thou talkest of an admirable conceited fellow. Has he any"
23992,"He hath ribbons of all the colours i’ th’ rainbow; points, more than"
23993,"all the lawyers in Bohemia can learnedly handle, though they come to"
23994,"him by th’ gross; inkles, caddisses, cambrics, lawns; why he sings ’em"
23995,over as they were gods or goddesses; you would think a smock were a
23996,"she-angel, he so chants to the sleeve-hand and the work about the"
23997,Prithee bring him in; and let him approach singing.
23998,Forewarn him that he use no scurrilous words in ’s tunes.
23999,"You have of these pedlars that have more in them than you’d think,"
24000,"Ay, good brother, or go about to think."
24001,"_Lawn as white as driven snow,"
24002,"Cypress black as e’er was crow,"
24003,"Gloves as sweet as damask roses,"
24004,"Masks for faces and for noses,"
24005,"Perfume for a lady’s chamber,"
24006,Golden quoifs and stomachers
24007,"For my lads to give their dears,"
24008,"Pins and poking-sticks of steel,"
24009,What maids lack from head to heel.
24010,"Come buy of me, come; come buy, come buy;"
24011,"Buy, lads, or else your lasses cry."
24012,"If I were not in love with Mopsa, thou shouldst take no money of me;"
24013,"but being enthralled as I am, it will also be the bondage of certain"
24014,I was promised them against the feast; but they come not too late now.
24015,"He hath promised you more than that, or there be liars."
24016,"He hath paid you all he promised you. Maybe he has paid you more, which"
24017,will shame you to give him again.
24018,Is there no manners left among maids? Will they wear their plackets
24019,"where they should bear their faces? Is there not milking-time, when you"
24020,"are going to bed, or kiln-hole, to whistle of these secrets, but you"
24021,must be tittle-tattling before all our guests? ’Tis well they are
24022,"whispering. Clamour your tongues, and not a word more."
24023,"I have done. Come, you promised me a tawdry lace and a pair of sweet"
24024,Have I not told thee how I was cozened by the way and lost all my
24025,"And indeed, sir, there are cozeners abroad; therefore it behoves men to"
24026,"Fear not thou, man. Thou shalt lose nothing here."
24027,"I hope so, sir; for I have about me many parcels of charge."
24028,What hast here? Ballads?
24029,"Pray now, buy some. I love a ballad in print alife, for then we are"
24030,sure they are true.
24031,Here’s one to a very doleful tune. How a usurer’s wife was brought to
24032,"bed of twenty money-bags at a burden, and how she longed to eat adders’"
24033,heads and toads carbonadoed.
24034,"Is it true, think you?"
24035,"Very true, and but a month old."
24036,Bless me from marrying a usurer!
24037,"Here’s the midwife’s name to’t, one Mistress Taleporter, and five or"
24038,six honest wives that were present. Why should I carry lies abroad?
24039,"Pray you now, buy it."
24040,"Come on, lay it by; and let’s first see more ballads. We’ll buy the"
24041,"Here’s another ballad, of a fish that appeared upon the coast on"
24042,"Wednesday the fourscore of April, forty thousand fathom above water,"
24043,and sung this ballad against the hard hearts of maids. It was thought
24044,"she was a woman, and was turned into a cold fish for she would not"
24045,"exchange flesh with one that loved her. The ballad is very pitiful, and"
24046,"Is it true too, think you?"
24047,"Five justices’ hands at it, and witnesses more than my pack will hold."
24048,Lay it by too: another.
24049,This is a merry ballad; but a very pretty one.
24050,Let’s have some merry ones.
24051,"Why, this is a passing merry one and goes to the tune of “Two maids"
24052,wooing a man.” There’s scarce a maid westward but she sings it. ’Tis in
24053,"request, I can tell you."
24054,"We can both sing it: if thou’lt bear a part, thou shalt hear; ’tis in"
24055,We had the tune on ’t a month ago.
24056,I can bear my part; you must know ’tis my occupation: have at it with
24057,"_Get you hence, for I must go"
24058,Where it fits not you to know._
24059,_It becomes thy oath full well
24060,Thou to me thy secrets tell._
24061,_Me too! Let me go thither._
24062,Or thou goest to th’ grange or mill.
24063,"_If to either, thou dost ill._"
24064,_Thou hast sworn my love to be._
24065,_Thou hast sworn it more to me.
24066,"Then whither goest? Say, whither?_"
24067,We’ll have this song out anon by ourselves. My father and the gentlemen
24068,"are in sad talk, and we’ll not trouble them. Come, bring away thy pack"
24069,"after me. Wenches, I’ll buy for you both. Pedlar, let’s have the first"
24070,"choice. Follow me, girls."
24071,"_Will you buy any tape,"
24072,"Or lace for your cape,"
24073,"My dainty duck, my dear-a?"
24074,"Any silk, any thread,"
24075,"Any toys for your head,"
24076,"Of the new’st and fin’st, fin’st wear-a?"
24077,Come to the pedlar;
24078,That doth utter all men’s ware-a._
24079,"Master, there is three carters, three shepherds, three neat-herds,"
24080,"three swine-herds, that have made themselves all men of hair. They call"
24081,"themselves saltiers, and they have dance which the wenches say is a"
24082,"gallimaufry of gambols, because they are not in ’t; but they themselves"
24083,are o’ the mind (if it be not too rough for some that know little but
24084,bowling) it will please plentifully.
24085,Away! we’ll none on ’t. Here has been too much homely foolery already.
24086,"I know, sir, we weary you."
24087,"You weary those that refresh us: pray, let’s see these four threes of"
24088,"One three of them, by their own report, sir, hath danced before the"
24089,king; and not the worst of the three but jumps twelve foot and a half
24090,"Leave your prating: since these good men are pleased, let them come in;"
24091,"Why, they stay at door, sir."
24092,"Enter Twelve Rustics, habited like Satyrs. They dance, and then"
24093,"O, father, you’ll know more of that hereafter."
24094,"He’s simple and tells much. [_To Florizel._] How now, fair shepherd!"
24095,Your heart is full of something that does take
24096,"Your mind from feasting. Sooth, when I was young"
24097,"And handed love, as you do, I was wont"
24098,To load my she with knacks: I would have ransack’d
24099,The pedlar’s silken treasury and have pour’d it
24100,"To her acceptance. You have let him go,"
24101,And nothing marted with him. If your lass
24102,"Interpretation should abuse, and call this"
24103,"Your lack of love or bounty, you were straited"
24104,"For a reply, at least if you make a care"
24105,Of happy holding her.
24106,"Old sir, I know"
24107,She prizes not such trifles as these are:
24108,The gifts she looks from me are pack’d and lock’d
24109,"Up in my heart, which I have given already,"
24110,"But not deliver’d. O, hear me breathe my life"
24111,"Before this ancient sir, who, it should seem,"
24112,"Hath sometime lov’d. I take thy hand! this hand,"
24113,"As soft as dove’s down and as white as it,"
24114,"Or Ethiopian’s tooth, or the fann’d snow that’s bolted"
24115,By th’ northern blasts twice o’er.
24116,How prettily the young swain seems to wash
24117,The hand was fair before! I have put you out.
24118,But to your protestation. Let me hear
24119,"Do, and be witness to ’t."
24120,"And this my neighbour, too?"
24121,"And he, and more"
24122,"Than he, and men, the earth, the heavens, and all:"
24123,"That were I crown’d the most imperial monarch,"
24124,"Thereof most worthy, were I the fairest youth"
24125,"That ever made eye swerve, had force and knowledge"
24126,"More than was ever man’s, I would not prize them"
24127,Without her love; for her employ them all;
24128,"Commend them and condemn them to her service,"
24129,Or to their own perdition.
24130,This shows a sound affection.
24131,Say you the like to him?
24132,"So well, nothing so well; no, nor mean better:"
24133,By th’ pattern of mine own thoughts I cut out
24134,The purity of his.
24135,"Take hands, a bargain!"
24136,"And, friends unknown, you shall bear witness to’t."
24137,"I give my daughter to him, and will make"
24138,Her portion equal his.
24139,"O, that must be"
24140,"I’ th’ virtue of your daughter: one being dead,"
24141,I shall have more than you can dream of yet;
24142,"Enough then for your wonder. But come on,"
24143,Contract us ’fore these witnesses.
24144,"Soft, swain, awhile, beseech you;"
24145,Have you a father?
24146,I have; but what of him?
24147,Knows he of this?
24148,He neither does nor shall.
24149,Is at the nuptial of his son a guest
24150,"That best becomes the table. Pray you once more,"
24151,Is not your father grown incapable
24152,Of reasonable affairs? is he not stupid
24153,With age and alt’ring rheums? can he speak? hear?
24154,Know man from man? dispute his own estate?
24155,Lies he not bed-rid? and again does nothing
24156,But what he did being childish?
24157,"He has his health, and ampler strength indeed"
24158,Than most have of his age.
24159,"By my white beard,"
24160,"You offer him, if this be so, a wrong"
24161,Something unfilial: reason my son
24162,"Should choose himself a wife, but as good reason"
24163,"The father, all whose joy is nothing else"
24164,"But fair posterity, should hold some counsel"
24165,In such a business.
24166,I yield all this;
24167,"But for some other reasons, my grave sir,"
24168,"Which ’tis not fit you know, I not acquaint"
24169,My father of this business.
24170,Let him know ’t.
24171,"No, he must not."
24172,"Let him, my son: he shall not need to grieve"
24173,At knowing of thy choice.
24174,"Come, come, he must not."
24175,Whom son I dare not call; thou art too base
24176,"To be acknowledged: thou a sceptre’s heir,"
24177,"That thus affects a sheep-hook! Thou, old traitor,"
24178,"I am sorry that, by hanging thee, I can"
24179,"But shorten thy life one week. And thou, fresh piece"
24180,"Of excellent witchcraft, whom of force must know"
24181,"The royal fool thou cop’st with,—"
24182,I’ll have thy beauty scratch’d with briers and made
24183,"More homely than thy state. For thee, fond boy,"
24184,If I may ever know thou dost but sigh
24185,That thou no more shalt see this knack (as never
24186,"I mean thou shalt), we’ll bar thee from succession;"
24187,"Not hold thee of our blood, no, not our kin,"
24188,Far than Deucalion off. Mark thou my words.
24189,"Follow us to the court. Thou churl, for this time,"
24190,"Though full of our displeasure, yet we free thee"
24191,"From the dead blow of it. And you, enchantment,"
24192,"Worthy enough a herdsman; yea, him too"
24193,"That makes himself, but for our honour therein,"
24194,Unworthy thee. If ever henceforth thou
24195,"These rural latches to his entrance open,"
24196,"Or hoop his body more with thy embraces,"
24197,I will devise a death as cruel for thee
24198,As thou art tender to ’t.
24199,"I was not much afeard, for once or twice"
24200,"I was about to speak, and tell him plainly"
24201,The selfsame sun that shines upon his court
24202,"Hides not his visage from our cottage, but"
24203,"Looks on alike. [_To Florizel._] Will’t please you, sir, be gone?"
24204,"I told you what would come of this. Beseech you,"
24205,Of your own state take care. This dream of mine—
24206,"Being now awake, I’ll queen it no inch farther,"
24207,"But milk my ewes, and weep."
24208,"Why, how now, father!"
24209,Speak ere thou diest.
24210,"I cannot speak, nor think,"
24211,"Nor dare to know that which I know. O sir,"
24212,"You have undone a man of fourscore three,"
24213,"That thought to fill his grave in quiet; yea,"
24214,"To die upon the bed my father died,"
24215,To lie close by his honest bones; but now
24216,Some hangman must put on my shroud and lay me
24217,"Where no priest shovels in dust. O cursed wretch,"
24218,"That knew’st this was the prince, and wouldst adventure"
24219,"To mingle faith with him! Undone, undone!"
24220,"If I might die within this hour, I have liv’d"
24221,To die when I desire.
24222,Why look you so upon me?
24223,"I am but sorry, not afeard; delay’d,"
24224,"But nothing alt’red: what I was, I am:"
24225,More straining on for plucking back; not following
24226,You know your father’s temper: at this time
24227,He will allow no speech (which I do guess
24228,You do not purpose to him) and as hardly
24229,"Will he endure your sight as yet, I fear:"
24230,"Then, till the fury of his highness settle,"
24231,Come not before him.
24232,I not purpose it.
24233,"Even he, my lord."
24234,How often have I told you ’twould be thus!
24235,How often said my dignity would last
24236,But till ’twere known!
24237,It cannot fail but by
24238,The violation of my faith; and then
24239,Let nature crush the sides o’ th’ earth together
24240,And mar the seeds within! Lift up thy looks.
24241,"From my succession wipe me, father; I"
24242,Am heir to my affection.
24243,"I am, and by my fancy. If my reason"
24244,"Will thereto be obedient, I have reason;"
24245,"If not, my senses, better pleas’d with madness,"
24246,Do bid it welcome.
24247,"This is desperate, sir."
24248,So call it: but it does fulfil my vow.
24249,"I needs must think it honesty. Camillo,"
24250,"Not for Bohemia, nor the pomp that may"
24251,Be thereat glean’d; for all the sun sees or
24252,"The close earth wombs, or the profound seas hides"
24253,"In unknown fathoms, will I break my oath"
24254,"To this my fair belov’d. Therefore, I pray you,"
24255,"As you have ever been my father’s honour’d friend,"
24256,"When he shall miss me,—as, in faith, I mean not"
24257,"To see him any more,—cast your good counsels"
24258,Upon his passion: let myself and fortune
24259,"Tug for the time to come. This you may know,"
24260,"And so deliver, I am put to sea"
24261,With her whom here I cannot hold on shore;
24262,"And, most opportune to her need, I have"
24263,"A vessel rides fast by, but not prepar’d"
24264,For this design. What course I mean to hold
24265,"Shall nothing benefit your knowledge, nor"
24266,Concern me the reporting.
24267,"I would your spirit were easier for advice,"
24268,Or stronger for your need.
24269,"Hark, Perdita. [_Takes her aside._]"
24270,Resolv’d for flight. Now were I happy if
24271,"His going I could frame to serve my turn,"
24272,"Save him from danger, do him love and honour,"
24273,Purchase the sight again of dear Sicilia
24274,"And that unhappy king, my master, whom"
24275,I so much thirst to see.
24276,I am so fraught with curious business that
24277,I leave out ceremony.
24278,"You have heard of my poor services, i’ th’ love"
24279,That I have borne your father?
24280,Have you deserv’d: it is my father’s music
24281,"To speak your deeds, not little of his care"
24282,To have them recompens’d as thought on.
24283,"If you may please to think I love the king,"
24284,"And, through him, what’s nearest to him, which is"
24285,"Your gracious self, embrace but my direction,"
24286,If your more ponderous and settled project
24287,"May suffer alteration. On mine honour,"
24288,I’ll point you where you shall have such receiving
24289,As shall become your highness; where you may
24290,"Enjoy your mistress; from the whom, I see,"
24291,"There’s no disjunction to be made, but by,"
24292,"As heavens forfend, your ruin. Marry her,"
24293,And with my best endeavours in your absence
24294,Your discontenting father strive to qualify
24295,And bring him up to liking.
24296,"May this, almost a miracle, be done?"
24297,"That I may call thee something more than man,"
24298,And after that trust to thee.
24299,Have you thought on
24300,A place whereto you’ll go?
24301,But as th’ unthought-on accident is guilty
24302,"To what we wildly do, so we profess"
24303,"Ourselves to be the slaves of chance, and flies"
24304,Of every wind that blows.
24305,Then list to me:
24306,"This follows, if you will not change your purpose,"
24307,"But undergo this flight, make for Sicilia,"
24308,"And there present yourself and your fair princess,"
24309,"For so, I see, she must be, ’fore Leontes:"
24310,She shall be habited as it becomes
24311,The partner of your bed. Methinks I see
24312,Leontes opening his free arms and weeping
24313,"His welcomes forth; asks thee, the son, forgiveness,"
24314,As ’twere i’ th’ father’s person; kisses the hands
24315,Of your fresh princess; o’er and o’er divides him
24316,’Twixt his unkindness and his kindness. Th’ one
24317,"He chides to hell, and bids the other grow"
24318,Faster than thought or time.
24319,What colour for my visitation shall I
24320,Hold up before him?
24321,Sent by the king your father
24322,"To greet him and to give him comforts. Sir,"
24323,"The manner of your bearing towards him, with"
24324,"What you (as from your father) shall deliver,"
24325,"Things known betwixt us three, I’ll write you down,"
24326,The which shall point you forth at every sitting
24327,What you must say; that he shall not perceive
24328,But that you have your father’s bosom there
24329,And speak his very heart.
24330,I am bound to you:
24331,There is some sap in this.
24332,A course more promising
24333,Than a wild dedication of yourselves
24334,"To unpath’d waters, undream’d shores, most certain"
24335,"To miseries enough: no hope to help you,"
24336,But as you shake off one to take another:
24337,"Nothing so certain as your anchors, who"
24338,Do their best office if they can but stay you
24339,"Where you’ll be loath to be. Besides, you know"
24340,"Prosperity’s the very bond of love,"
24341,Whose fresh complexion and whose heart together
24342,One of these is true:
24343,"I think affliction may subdue the cheek,"
24344,But not take in the mind.
24345,"Yea, say you so?"
24346,"There shall not at your father’s house, these seven years"
24347,Be born another such.
24348,She is as forward of her breeding as
24349,She is i’ th’ rear our birth.
24350,I cannot say ’tis pity
24351,"She lacks instructions, for she seems a mistress"
24352,To most that teach.
24353,"Your pardon, sir; for this"
24354,I’ll blush you thanks.
24355,"But, O, the thorns we stand upon! Camillo,"
24356,"Preserver of my father, now of me,"
24357,"The medicine of our house, how shall we do?"
24358,"We are not furnish’d like Bohemia’s son,"
24359,Nor shall appear in Sicilia.
24360,Fear none of this. I think you know my fortunes
24361,Do all lie there: it shall be so my care
24362,To have you royally appointed as if
24363,"The scene you play were mine. For instance, sir,"
24364,"That you may know you shall not want,—one word."
24365,"Ha, ha! what a fool Honesty is! and Trust, his sworn brother, a very"
24366,"simple gentleman! I have sold all my trumpery. Not a counterfeit stone,"
24367,"not a ribbon, glass, pomander, brooch, table-book, ballad, knife, tape,"
24368,"glove, shoe-tie, bracelet, horn-ring, to keep my pack from fasting."
24369,"They throng who should buy first, as if my trinkets had been hallowed"
24370,and brought a benediction to the buyer: by which means I saw whose
24371,"purse was best in picture; and what I saw, to my good use I remembered."
24372,My clown (who wants but something to be a reasonable man) grew so in
24373,love with the wenches’ song that he would not stir his pettitoes till
24374,he had both tune and words; which so drew the rest of the herd to me
24375,that all their other senses stuck in ears: you might have pinched a
24376,"placket, it was senseless; ’twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a purse;"
24377,"I would have filed keys off that hung in chains: no hearing, no"
24378,"feeling, but my sir’s song, and admiring the nothing of it. So that in"
24379,this time of lethargy I picked and cut most of their festival purses;
24380,and had not the old man come in with a whoobub against his daughter and
24381,"the king’s son, and scared my choughs from the chaff, I had not left a"
24382,purse alive in the whole army.
24383,"Camillo, Florizel and Perdita come forward."
24384,"Nay, but my letters, by this means being there"
24385,"So soon as you arrive, shall clear that doubt."
24386,And those that you’ll procure from king Leontes?
24387,Shall satisfy your father.
24388,All that you speak shows fair.
24389,We’ll make an instrument of this; omit
24390,Nothing may give us aid.
24391,"How now, good fellow! why shakest thou so? Fear not, man; here’s no"
24392,harm intended to thee.
24393,"I am a poor fellow, sir."
24394,"Why, be so still; here’s nobody will steal that from thee: yet, for the"
24395,outside of thy poverty we must make an exchange; therefore discase thee
24396,"instantly,—thou must think there’s a necessity in’t—and change garments"
24397,"with this gentleman: though the pennyworth on his side be the worst,"
24398,"yet hold thee, there’s some boot."
24399,"I am a poor fellow, sir: [_Aside._] I know ye well enough."
24400,"Nay, prithee dispatch: the gentleman is half flayed already."
24401,"Are you in earnest, sir? [_Aside._] I smell the trick on’t."
24402,"Indeed, I have had earnest; but I cannot with conscience take it."
24403,"Fortunate mistress,—let my prophecy"
24404,Come home to you!—you must retire yourself
24405,Into some covert. Take your sweetheart’s hat
24406,"And pluck it o’er your brows, muffle your face,"
24407,"Dismantle you; and, as you can, disliken"
24408,The truth of your own seeming; that you may
24409,I see the play so lies
24410,That I must bear a part.
24411,Have you done there?
24412,"Should I now meet my father,"
24413,He would not call me son.
24414,"Nay, you shall have no hat. [_Giving it to Perdita._]"
24415,"Come, lady, come. Farewell, my friend."
24416,"O Perdita, what have we twain forgot?"
24417,Pray you a word.
24418,"Of this escape, and whither they are bound;"
24419,Wherein my hope is I shall so prevail
24420,To force him after: in whose company
24421,I shall re-view Sicilia; for whose sight
24422,I have a woman’s longing.
24423,"Thus we set on, Camillo, to the sea-side."
24424,The swifter speed the better.
24425,"I understand the business, I hear it. To have an open ear, a quick eye,"
24426,"and a nimble hand, is necessary for a cut-purse; a good nose is"
24427,"requisite also, to smell out work for the other senses. I see this is"
24428,the time that the unjust man doth thrive. What an exchange had this
24429,been without boot! What a boot is here with this exchange! Sure the
24430,"gods do this year connive at us, and we may do anything extempore. The"
24431,"prince himself is about a piece of iniquity, stealing away from his"
24432,father with his clog at his heels: if I thought it were a piece of
24433,"honesty to acquaint the king withal, I would not do’t: I hold it the"
24434,more knavery to conceal it; and therein am I constant to my profession.
24435,Enter Clown and Shepherd.
24436,"Aside, aside; here is more matter for a hot brain: every lane’s end,"
24437,"every shop, church, session, hanging, yields a careful man work."
24438,"See, see; what a man you are now! There is no other way but to tell the"
24439,"king she’s a changeling, and none of your flesh and blood."
24440,"Nay, but hear me."
24441,"Nay, but hear me."
24442,"She being none of your flesh and blood, your flesh and blood has not"
24443,offended the king; and so your flesh and blood is not to be punished by
24444,"him. Show those things you found about her, those secret things, all"
24445,"but what she has with her: this being done, let the law go whistle, I"
24446,"I will tell the king all, every word, yea, and his son’s pranks too;"
24447,"who, I may say, is no honest man neither to his father nor to me, to go"
24448,about to make me the king’s brother-in-law.
24449,"Indeed, brother-in-law was the farthest off you could have been to him,"
24450,and then your blood had been the dearer by I know how much an ounce.
24451,"Well, let us to the king: there is that in this fardel will make him"
24452,flight of my master.
24453,Pray heartily he be at’ palace.
24454,chance. Let me pocket up my pedlar’s excrement. [_Takes off his false
24455,"beard._] How now, rustics! whither are you bound?"
24456,"To the palace, an it like your worship."
24457,"Your affairs there, what, with whom, the condition of that fardel, the"
24458,"place of your dwelling, your names, your ages, of what having,"
24459,"breeding, and anything that is fitting to be known? discover!"
24460,"We are but plain fellows, sir."
24461,A lie; you are rough and hairy. Let me have no lying. It becomes none
24462,"but tradesmen, and they often give us soldiers the lie; but we pay them"
24463,"for it with stamped coin, not stabbing steel; therefore they do not"
24464,give us the lie.
24465,"Your worship had like to have given us one, if you had not taken"
24466,yourself with the manner.
24467,"Are you a courtier, an ’t like you, sir?"
24468,"Whether it like me or no, I am a courtier. Seest thou not the air of"
24469,the court in these enfoldings? hath not my gait in it the measure of
24470,the court? receives not thy nose court-odour from me? reflect I not on
24471,"thy baseness court-contempt? Think’st thou, for that I insinuate, or"
24472,"toaze from thee thy business, I am therefore no courtier? I am courtier"
24473,"_cap-a-pe_, and one that will either push on or pluck back thy business"
24474,there. Whereupon I command thee to open thy affair.
24475,"My business, sir, is to the king."
24476,What advocate hast thou to him?
24477,"I know not, an ’t like you."
24478,Advocate’s the court-word for a pheasant. Say you have none.
24479,"None, sir; I have no pheasant, cock nor hen."
24480,How bless’d are we that are not simple men!
24481,"Yet nature might have made me as these are,"
24482,Therefore I will not disdain.
24483,This cannot be but a great courtier.
24484,"His garments are rich, but he wears them not handsomely."
24485,"He seems to be the more noble in being fantastical: a great man, I’ll"
24486,warrant; I know by the picking on’s teeth.
24487,The fardel there? What’s i’ th’ fardel? Wherefore that box?
24488,"Sir, there lies such secrets in this fardel and box which none must"
24489,"know but the king; and which he shall know within this hour, if I may"
24490,come to th’ speech of him.
24491,"Age, thou hast lost thy labour."
24492,The king is not at the palace; he is gone aboard a new ship to purge
24493,"melancholy and air himself: for, if thou beest capable of things"
24494,"serious, thou must know the king is full of grief."
24495,"So ’tis said, sir; about his son, that should have married a shepherd’s"
24496,"If that shepherd be not in hand-fast, let him fly. The curses he shall"
24497,"have, the tortures he shall feel, will break the back of man, the heart"
24498,"Think you so, sir?"
24499,Not he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy and vengeance bitter;
24500,"but those that are germane to him, though removed fifty times, shall"
24501,"all come under the hangman: which, though it be great pity, yet it is"
24502,"necessary. An old sheep-whistling rogue, a ram-tender, to offer to have"
24503,his daughter come into grace! Some say he shall be stoned; but that
24504,"death is too soft for him, say I. Draw our throne into a sheepcote! All"
24505,"deaths are too few, the sharpest too easy."
24506,"Has the old man e’er a son, sir, do you hear, an ’t like you, sir?"
24507,"He has a son, who shall be flayed alive; then ’nointed over with honey,"
24508,set on the head of a wasp’s nest; then stand till he be three quarters
24509,and a dram dead; then recovered again with aqua-vitæ or some other hot
24510,"infusion; then, raw as he is, and in the hottest day prognostication"
24511,"proclaims, shall he be set against a brick wall, the sun looking with a"
24512,"southward eye upon him, where he is to behold him with flies blown to"
24513,"death. But what talk we of these traitorly rascals, whose miseries are"
24514,"to be smiled at, their offences being so capital? Tell me (for you seem"
24515,to be honest plain men) what you have to the king. Being something
24516,"gently considered, I’ll bring you where he is aboard, tender your"
24517,"persons to his presence, whisper him in your behalfs; and if it be in"
24518,"man besides the king to effect your suits, here is man shall do it."
24519,"He seems to be of great authority: close with him, give him gold; and"
24520,"though authority be a stubborn bear, yet he is oft led by the nose with"
24521,"gold: show the inside of your purse to the outside of his hand, and no"
24522,more ado. Remember: “ston’d” and “flayed alive”.
24523,"An ’t please you, sir, to undertake the business for us, here is that"
24524,"gold I have. I’ll make it as much more, and leave this young man in"
24525,pawn till I bring it you.
24526,After I have done what I promised?
24527,"Well, give me the moiety. Are you a party in this business?"
24528,"In some sort, sir: but though my case be a pitiful one, I hope I shall"
24529,not be flayed out of it.
24530,"O, that’s the case of the shepherd’s son. Hang him, he’ll be made an"
24531,"Comfort, good comfort! We must to the king and show our strange sights."
24532,He must know ’tis none of your daughter nor my sister; we are gone
24533,"else. Sir, I will give you as much as this old man does when the"
24534,"business is performed, and remain, as he says, your pawn till it be"
24535,I will trust you. Walk before toward the sea-side; go on the
24536,"right-hand. I will but look upon the hedge, and follow you."
24537,"We are blessed in this man, as I may say, even blessed."
24538,"Let’s before, as he bids us. He was provided to do us good."
24539,"If I had a mind to be honest, I see Fortune would not suffer me: she"
24540,drops booties in my mouth. I am courted now with a double occasion:
24541,"gold, and a means to do the prince my master good; which who knows how"
24542,"that may turn back to my advancement? I will bring these two moles,"
24543,"these blind ones, aboard him. If he think it fit to shore them again"
24544,"and that the complaint they have to the king concerns him nothing, let"
24545,him call me rogue for being so far officious; for I am proof against
24546,that title and what shame else belongs to ’t. To him will I present
24547,them. There may be matter in it.
24548,SCENE I. Sicilia. A Room in the palace of Leontes.
24549,"Enter Leontes, Cleomenes, Dion, Paulina and others."
24550,"Sir, you have done enough, and have perform’d"
24551,A saint-like sorrow: no fault could you make
24552,"Which you have not redeem’d; indeed, paid down"
24553,"More penitence than done trespass: at the last,"
24554,"Do as the heavens have done, forget your evil;"
24555,"With them, forgive yourself."
24556,"Her and her virtues, I cannot forget"
24557,My blemishes in them; and so still think of
24558,The wrong I did myself: which was so much
24559,"That heirless it hath made my kingdom, and"
24560,Destroy’d the sweet’st companion that e’er man
24561,Bred his hopes out of.
24562,"True, too true, my lord."
24563,"If, one by one, you wedded all the world,"
24564,"Or from the all that are took something good,"
24565,"To make a perfect woman, she you kill’d"
24566,I think so. Kill’d!
24567,She I kill’d! I did so: but thou strik’st me
24568,"Sorely, to say I did: it is as bitter"
24569,"Upon thy tongue as in my thought. Now, good now,"
24570,Say so but seldom.
24571,"Not at all, good lady."
24572,You might have spoken a thousand things that would
24573,Have done the time more benefit and grac’d
24574,You are one of those
24575,Would have him wed again.
24576,"If you would not so,"
24577,"You pity not the state, nor the remembrance"
24578,Of his most sovereign name; consider little
24579,"What dangers, by his highness’ fail of issue,"
24580,"May drop upon his kingdom, and devour"
24581,Incertain lookers-on. What were more holy
24582,Than to rejoice the former queen is well?
24583,"What holier than, for royalty’s repair,"
24584,"For present comfort, and for future good,"
24585,To bless the bed of majesty again
24586,With a sweet fellow to ’t?
24587,"There is none worthy,"
24588,"Respecting her that’s gone. Besides, the gods"
24589,Will have fulfill’d their secret purposes;
24590,"For has not the divine Apollo said,"
24591,"Is ’t not the tenor of his oracle,"
24592,That king Leontes shall not have an heir
24593,"Till his lost child be found? Which that it shall,"
24594,Is all as monstrous to our human reason
24595,As my Antigonus to break his grave
24596,"And come again to me; who, on my life,"
24597,Did perish with the infant. ’Tis your counsel
24598,"My lord should to the heavens be contrary,"
24599,Oppose against their wills. [_To Leontes._] Care not for issue;
24600,The crown will find an heir. Great Alexander
24601,Left his to th’ worthiest; so his successor
24602,Was like to be the best.
24603,"Who hast the memory of Hermione,"
24604,"I know, in honour, O that ever I"
24605,"Had squar’d me to thy counsel! Then, even now,"
24606,"I might have look’d upon my queen’s full eyes,"
24607,"Have taken treasure from her lips,—"
24608,More rich for what they yielded.
24609,"No more such wives; therefore, no wife: one worse,"
24610,"And better us’d, would make her sainted spirit"
24611,"Again possess her corpse, and on this stage,"
24612,And begin “Why to me?”
24613,"Had she such power,"
24614,She had just cause.
24615,She had; and would incense me
24616,To murder her I married.
24617,"Were I the ghost that walk’d, I’d bid you mark"
24618,"Her eye, and tell me for what dull part in ’t"
24619,"You chose her: then I’d shriek, that even your ears"
24620,Should rift to hear me; and the words that follow’d
24621,Should be “Remember mine.”
24622,And all eyes else dead coals! Fear thou no wife;
24623,"I’ll have no wife, Paulina."
24624,Never to marry but by my free leave?
24625,"Never, Paulina; so be bless’d my spirit!"
24626,"Then, good my lords, bear witness to his oath."
24627,You tempt him over-much.
24628,"As like Hermione as is her picture,"
24629,"Yet, if my lord will marry,—if you will, sir,"
24630,"No remedy but you will,—give me the office"
24631,To choose you a queen: she shall not be so young
24632,"As was your former, but she shall be such"
24633,"As, walk’d your first queen’s ghost, it should take joy"
24634,To see her in your arms.
24635,We shall not marry till thou bid’st us.
24636,Shall be when your first queen’s again in breath;
24637,"One that gives out himself Prince Florizel,"
24638,"Son of Polixenes, with his princess (she"
24639,The fairest I have yet beheld) desires access
24640,To your high presence.
24641,What with him? he comes not
24642,"Like to his father’s greatness: his approach,"
24643,"So out of circumstance and sudden, tells us"
24644,"’Tis not a visitation fram’d, but forc’d"
24645,By need and accident. What train?
24646,And those but mean.
24647,"His princess, say you, with him?"
24648,"Ay, the most peerless piece of earth, I think,"
24649,That e’er the sun shone bright on.
24650,As every present time doth boast itself
24651,"Above a better gone, so must thy grave"
24652,"Give way to what’s seen now! Sir, you yourself"
24653,"Have said and writ so,—but your writing now"
24654,"Is colder than that theme,—‘She had not been,"
24655,Nor was not to be equall’d’; thus your verse
24656,"Flow’d with her beauty once; ’tis shrewdly ebb’d,"
24657,To say you have seen a better.
24658,"The one I have almost forgot,—your pardon;—"
24659,"The other, when she has obtain’d your eye,"
24660,"Will have your tongue too. This is a creature,"
24661,"Would she begin a sect, might quench the zeal"
24662,Of all professors else; make proselytes
24663,Of who she but bid follow.
24664,Women will love her that she is a woman
24665,"More worth than any man; men, that she is"
24666,The rarest of all women.
24667,"Yourself, assisted with your honour’d friends,"
24668,Bring them to our embracement.
24669,He thus should steal upon us.
24670,"Jewel of children, seen this hour, he had pair’d"
24671,Well with this lord. There was not full a month
24672,Prithee no more; cease; Thou know’st
24673,"He dies to me again when talk’d of: sure,"
24674,"When I shall see this gentleman, thy speeches"
24675,Will bring me to consider that which may
24676,Unfurnish me of reason. They are come.
24677,"Enter Florizel, Perdita, Cleomenes and others."
24678,"Your mother was most true to wedlock, prince;"
24679,"For she did print your royal father off,"
24680,"Conceiving you. Were I but twenty-one,"
24681,"Your father’s image is so hit in you,"
24682,"His very air, that I should call you brother,"
24683,"As I did him, and speak of something wildly"
24684,By us perform’d before. Most dearly welcome!
24685,"And your fair princess,—goddess! O, alas!"
24686,I lost a couple that ’twixt heaven and earth
24687,"Might thus have stood, begetting wonder, as"
24688,"You, gracious couple, do! And then I lost,—"
24689,"All mine own folly,—the society,"
24690,"Amity too, of your brave father, whom,"
24691,"Though bearing misery, I desire my life"
24692,Once more to look on him.
24693,"Have I here touch’d Sicilia, and from him"
24694,"Give you all greetings that a king, at friend,"
24695,"Can send his brother: and, but infirmity,"
24696,"Which waits upon worn times, hath something seiz’d"
24697,"His wish’d ability, he had himself"
24698,The lands and waters ’twixt your throne and his
24699,"Measur’d, to look upon you; whom he loves,"
24700,"He bade me say so,—more than all the sceptres"
24701,And those that bear them living.
24702,Good gentleman!—the wrongs I have done thee stir
24703,"Afresh within me; and these thy offices,"
24704,"So rarely kind, are as interpreters"
24705,"Of my behind-hand slackness! Welcome hither,"
24706,As is the spring to the earth. And hath he too
24707,"Expos’d this paragon to the fearful usage,"
24708,"At least ungentle, of the dreadful Neptune,"
24709,"To greet a man not worth her pains, much less"
24710,Th’ adventure of her person?
24711,She came from Libya.
24712,"Where the warlike Smalus,"
24713,"That noble honour’d lord, is fear’d and lov’d?"
24714,"Most royal sir, from thence; from him, whose daughter"
24715,"His tears proclaim’d his, parting with her: thence,"
24716,"A prosperous south-wind friendly, we have cross’d,"
24717,To execute the charge my father gave me
24718,For visiting your highness: my best train
24719,I have from your Sicilian shores dismiss’d;
24720,"Who for Bohemia bend, to signify"
24721,"Not only my success in Libya, sir,"
24722,"But my arrival, and my wife’s, in safety"
24723,"Here, where we are."
24724,Purge all infection from our air whilst you
24725,"Do climate here! You have a holy father,"
24726,"A graceful gentleman; against whose person,"
24727,"So sacred as it is, I have done sin,"
24728,"For which the heavens, taking angry note,"
24729,"Have left me issueless. And your father’s bless’d,"
24730,"As he from heaven merits it, with you,"
24731,"Worthy his goodness. What might I have been,"
24732,"Might I a son and daughter now have look’d on,"
24733,Such goodly things as you!
24734,"That which I shall report will bear no credit,"
24735,"Were not the proof so nigh. Please you, great sir,"
24736,Bohemia greets you from himself by me;
24737,"Desires you to attach his son, who has—"
24738,His dignity and duty both cast off—
24739,"Fled from his father, from his hopes, and with"
24740,Here in your city; I now came from him.
24741,"I speak amazedly, and it becomes"
24742,My marvel and my message. To your court
24743,"Whiles he was hast’ning—in the chase, it seems,"
24744,Of this fair couple—meets he on the way
24745,The father of this seeming lady and
24746,"Her brother, having both their country quitted"
24747,With this young prince.
24748,Camillo has betray’d me;
24749,"Whose honour and whose honesty till now,"
24750,Lay ’t so to his charge.
24751,He’s with the king your father.
24752,"Camillo, sir; I spake with him; who now"
24753,Has these poor men in question. Never saw I
24754,"Wretches so quake: they kneel, they kiss the earth;"
24755,Forswear themselves as often as they speak.
24756,"Bohemia stops his ears, and threatens them"
24757,With divers deaths in death.
24758,O my poor father!
24759,"The heaven sets spies upon us, will not have"
24760,"We are not, sir, nor are we like to be."
24761,"The stars, I see, will kiss the valleys first."
24762,The odds for high and low’s alike.
24763,Is this the daughter of a king?
24764,When once she is my wife.
24765,"That “once”, I see by your good father’s speed,"
24766,"Will come on very slowly. I am sorry,"
24767,"Most sorry, you have broken from his liking,"
24768,Where you were tied in duty; and as sorry
24769,"Your choice is not so rich in worth as beauty,"
24770,That you might well enjoy her.
24771,"Though Fortune, visible an enemy,"
24772,"Should chase us with my father, power no jot"
24773,"Hath she to change our loves. Beseech you, sir,"
24774,Remember since you ow’d no more to time
24775,"Than I do now: with thought of such affections,"
24776,Step forth mine advocate. At your request
24777,My father will grant precious things as trifles.
24778,"Would he do so, I’d beg your precious mistress,"
24779,Which he counts but a trifle.
24780,Your eye hath too much youth in ’t: not a month
24781,"’Fore your queen died, she was more worth such gazes"
24782,Than what you look on now.
24783,I thought of her
24784,Even in these looks I made. [_To Florizel._] But your petition
24785,Is yet unanswer’d. I will to your father.
24786,"Your honour not o’erthrown by your desires,"
24787,I am friend to them and you: upon which errand
24788,"I now go toward him; therefore follow me,"
24789,"And mark what way I make. Come, good my lord."
24790,SCENE II. The same. Before the Palace.
24791,Enter Autolycus and a Gentleman.
24792,"Beseech you, sir, were you present at this relation?"
24793,"I was by at the opening of the fardel, heard the old shepherd deliver"
24794,"the manner how he found it: whereupon, after a little amazedness, we"
24795,"were all commanded out of the chamber; only this, methought I heard the"
24796,shepherd say he found the child.
24797,I would most gladly know the issue of it.
24798,I make a broken delivery of the business; but the changes I perceived
24799,in the king and Camillo were very notes of admiration. They seemed
24800,"almost, with staring on one another, to tear the cases of their eyes."
24801,"There was speech in their dumbness, language in their very gesture;"
24802,"they looked as they had heard of a world ransomed, or one destroyed. A"
24803,"notable passion of wonder appeared in them; but the wisest beholder,"
24804,that knew no more but seeing could not say if th’ importance were joy
24805,"or sorrow; but in the extremity of the one, it must needs be. Here"
24806,comes a gentleman that happily knows more.
24807,Nothing but bonfires: the oracle is fulfilled: the king’s daughter is
24808,found: such a deal of wonder is broken out within this hour that
24809,ballad-makers cannot be able to express it. Here comes the Lady
24810,Paulina’s steward: he can deliver you more.
24811,Enter a third Gentleman.
24812,"How goes it now, sir? This news, which is called true, is so like an"
24813,old tale that the verity of it is in strong suspicion. Has the king
24814,"Most true, if ever truth were pregnant by circumstance. That which you"
24815,"hear you’ll swear you see, there is such unity in the proofs. The"
24816,"mantle of Queen Hermione’s, her jewel about the neck of it, the letters"
24817,"of Antigonus found with it, which they know to be his character; the"
24818,"majesty of the creature in resemblance of the mother, the affection of"
24819,"nobleness which nature shows above her breeding, and many other"
24820,evidences proclaim her with all certainty to be the king’s daughter.
24821,Did you see the meeting of the two kings?
24822,"Then you have lost a sight which was to be seen, cannot be spoken of."
24823,"There might you have beheld one joy crown another, so and in such"
24824,"manner that it seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them, for their joy"
24825,"waded in tears. There was casting up of eyes, holding up of hands, with"
24826,"countenance of such distraction that they were to be known by garment,"
24827,"not by favour. Our king, being ready to leap out of himself for joy of"
24828,"his found daughter, as if that joy were now become a loss, cries “O,"
24829,"thy mother, thy mother!” then asks Bohemia forgiveness; then embraces"
24830,his son-in-law; then again worries he his daughter with clipping her;
24831,"now he thanks the old shepherd, which stands by like a weather-bitten"
24832,"conduit of many kings’ reigns. I never heard of such another encounter,"
24833,"which lames report to follow it, and undoes description to do it."
24834,"What, pray you, became of Antigonus, that carried hence the child?"
24835,"Like an old tale still, which will have matter to rehearse, though"
24836,credit be asleep and not an ear open. He was torn to pieces with a
24837,"bear: this avouches the shepherd’s son, who has not only his innocence,"
24838,"which seems much, to justify him, but a handkerchief and rings of his"
24839,What became of his bark and his followers?
24840,"Wrecked the same instant of their master’s death, and in the view of"
24841,the shepherd: so that all the instruments which aided to expose the
24842,"child were even then lost when it was found. But O, the noble combat"
24843,that ’twixt joy and sorrow was fought in Paulina! She had one eye
24844,"declined for the loss of her husband, another elevated that the oracle"
24845,"was fulfilled. She lifted the princess from the earth, and so locks her"
24846,"in embracing, as if she would pin her to her heart, that she might no"
24847,more be in danger of losing.
24848,The dignity of this act was worth the audience of kings and princes;
24849,for by such was it acted.
24850,"One of the prettiest touches of all, and that which angled for mine"
24851,"eyes (caught the water, though not the fish) was, when at the relation"
24852,of the queen’s death (with the manner how she came to it bravely
24853,confessed and lamented by the king) how attentiveness wounded his
24854,"daughter; till, from one sign of dolour to another, she did, with an"
24855,"“Alas,” I would fain say, bleed tears, for I am sure my heart wept"
24856,"blood. Who was most marble there changed colour; some swooned, all"
24857,"sorrowed: if all the world could have seen it, the woe had been"
24858,Are they returned to the court?
24859,"No: the princess hearing of her mother’s statue, which is in the"
24860,"keeping of Paulina,—a piece many years in doing and now newly performed"
24861,"by that rare Italian master, Julio Romano, who, had he himself"
24862,"eternity, and could put breath into his work, would beguile Nature of"
24863,"her custom, so perfectly he is her ape: he so near to Hermione hath"
24864,done Hermione that they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of
24865,"answer. Thither with all greediness of affection are they gone, and"
24866,there they intend to sup.
24867,I thought she had some great matter there in hand; for she hath
24868,"privately twice or thrice a day, ever since the death of Hermione,"
24869,"visited that removed house. Shall we thither, and with our company"
24870,Who would be thence that has the benefit of access? Every wink of an
24871,eye some new grace will be born. Our absence makes us unthrifty to our
24872,"Now, had I not the dash of my former life in me, would preferment drop"
24873,on my head. I brought the old man and his son aboard the prince; told
24874,him I heard them talk of a fardel and I know not what. But he at that
24875,"time over-fond of the shepherd’s daughter (so he then took her to be),"
24876,"who began to be much sea-sick, and himself little better, extremity of"
24877,"weather continuing, this mystery remained undiscover’d. But ’tis all"
24878,"one to me; for had I been the finder-out of this secret, it would not"
24879,have relish’d among my other discredits.
24880,Enter Shepherd and Clown.
24881,"Here come those I have done good to against my will, and already"
24882,appearing in the blossoms of their fortune.
24883,"Come, boy; I am past more children, but thy sons and daughters will be"
24884,"You are well met, sir. You denied to fight with me this other day,"
24885,because I was no gentleman born. See you these clothes? Say you see
24886,them not and think me still no gentleman born: you were best say these
24887,"robes are not gentlemen born. Give me the lie, do; and try whether I am"
24888,not now a gentleman born.
24889,"I know you are now, sir, a gentleman born."
24890,"Ay, and have been so any time these four hours."
24891,"And so have I, boy!"
24892,So you have: but I was a gentleman born before my father; for the
24893,king’s son took me by the hand and called me brother; and then the two
24894,"kings called my father brother; and then the prince, my brother, and"
24895,"the princess, my sister, called my father father; and so we wept; and"
24896,there was the first gentleman-like tears that ever we shed.
24897,"We may live, son, to shed many more."
24898,"Ay; or else ’twere hard luck, being in so preposterous estate as we"
24899,"I humbly beseech you, sir, to pardon me all the faults I have committed"
24900,"to your worship, and to give me your good report to the prince my"
24901,"Prithee, son, do; for we must be gentle, now we are gentlemen."
24902,Thou wilt amend thy life?
24903,"Ay, an it like your good worship."
24904,Give me thy hand: I will swear to the prince thou art as honest a true
24905,fellow as any is in Bohemia.
24906,"You may say it, but not swear it."
24907,"Not swear it, now I am a gentleman? Let boors and franklins say it,"
24908,"How if it be false, son?"
24909,"If it be ne’er so false, a true gentleman may swear it in the behalf of"
24910,his friend. And I’ll swear to the prince thou art a tall fellow of thy
24911,hands and that thou wilt not be drunk; but I know thou art no tall
24912,fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be drunk: but I’ll swear it; and
24913,I would thou wouldst be a tall fellow of thy hands.
24914,"I will prove so, sir, to my power."
24915,"Ay, by any means, prove a tall fellow: if I do not wonder how thou"
24916,"dar’st venture to be drunk, not being a tall fellow, trust me not."
24917,"Hark! the kings and the princes, our kindred, are going to see the"
24918,"queen’s picture. Come, follow us: we’ll be thy good masters."
24919,SCENE III. The same. A Room in Paulina’s house.
24920,"Enter Leontes, Polixenes, Florizel, Perdita, Camillo, Paulina, Lords"
24921,"O grave and good Paulina, the great comfort"
24922,That I have had of thee!
24923,"I did not well, I meant well. All my services"
24924,"You have paid home: but that you have vouchsaf’d,"
24925,With your crown’d brother and these your contracted
24926,"Heirs of your kingdoms, my poor house to visit,"
24927,It is a surplus of your grace which never
24928,My life may last to answer.
24929,We honour you with trouble. But we came
24930,To see the statue of our queen: your gallery
24931,"Have we pass’d through, not without much content"
24932,In many singularities; but we saw not
24933,"That which my daughter came to look upon,"
24934,The statue of her mother.
24935,"As she liv’d peerless,"
24936,"So her dead likeness, I do well believe,"
24937,Excels whatever yet you look’d upon
24938,Or hand of man hath done; therefore I keep it
24939,"Lonely, apart. But here it is: prepare"
24940,To see the life as lively mock’d as ever
24941,"Still sleep mock’d death. Behold, and say ’tis well."
24942,"Paulina undraws a curtain, and discovers Hermione standing as a"
24943,"I like your silence, it the more shows off"
24944,"Your wonder: but yet speak. First you, my liege."
24945,Comes it not something near?
24946,"Chide me, dear stone, that I may say indeed"
24947,"Thou art Hermione; or rather, thou art she"
24948,In thy not chiding; for she was as tender
24949,"As infancy and grace. But yet, Paulina,"
24950,"Hermione was not so much wrinkled, nothing"
24951,So aged as this seems.
24952,"O, not by much!"
24953,"So much the more our carver’s excellence,"
24954,Which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her
24955,As she liv’d now.
24956,"As now she might have done,"
24957,So much to my good comfort as it is
24958,"Now piercing to my soul. O, thus she stood,"
24959,"Even with such life of majesty, warm life,"
24960,"As now it coldly stands, when first I woo’d her!"
24961,I am asham’d: does not the stone rebuke me
24962,"For being more stone than it? O royal piece,"
24963,"There’s magic in thy majesty, which has"
24964,My evils conjur’d to remembrance and
24965,"From thy admiring daughter took the spirits,"
24966,Standing like stone with thee.
24967,"And give me leave,"
24968,"And do not say ’tis superstition, that"
24969,"I kneel, and then implore her blessing. Lady,"
24970,"Dear queen, that ended when I but began,"
24971,Give me that hand of yours to kiss.
24972,"The statue is but newly fix’d, the colour’s"
24973,"My lord, your sorrow was too sore laid on,"
24974,"Which sixteen winters cannot blow away,"
24975,So many summers dry. Scarce any joy
24976,Did ever so long live; no sorrow
24977,But kill’d itself much sooner.
24978,Let him that was the cause of this have power
24979,To take off so much grief from you as he
24980,Will piece up in himself.
24981,If I had thought the sight of my poor image
24982,Would thus have wrought you—for the stone is mine—
24983,I’d not have show’d it.
24984,Do not draw the curtain.
24985,"No longer shall you gaze on’t, lest your fancy"
24986,May think anon it moves.
24987,"Let be, let be."
24988,"Would I were dead, but that methinks already—"
24989,"What was he that did make it? See, my lord,"
24990,Would you not deem it breath’d? And that those veins
24991,Did verily bear blood?
24992,The very life seems warm upon her lip.
24993,"The fixture of her eye has motion in ’t,"
24994,As we are mock’d with art.
24995,I’ll draw the curtain:
24996,My lord’s almost so far transported that
24997,He’ll think anon it lives.
24998,Make me to think so twenty years together!
24999,No settled senses of the world can match
25000,The pleasure of that madness. Let ’t alone.
25001,"I am sorry, sir, I have thus far stirr’d you: but"
25002,I could afflict you further.
25003,For this affliction has a taste as sweet
25004,As any cordial comfort. Still methinks
25005,There is an air comes from her. What fine chisel
25006,"Could ever yet cut breath? Let no man mock me,"
25007,For I will kiss her!
25008,"Good my lord, forbear:"
25009,The ruddiness upon her lip is wet;
25010,"You’ll mar it if you kiss it, stain your own"
25011,With oily painting. Shall I draw the curtain?
25012,"No, not these twenty years."
25013,So long could I
25014,"Stand by, a looker on."
25015,"Quit presently the chapel, or resolve you"
25016,"For more amazement. If you can behold it,"
25017,"I’ll make the statue move indeed, descend,"
25018,And take you by the hand. But then you’ll think
25019,What you can make her do
25020,"I am content to look on: what to speak,"
25021,I am content to hear; for ’tis as easy
25022,To make her speak as move.
25023,You do awake your faith. Then all stand still;
25024,Or those that think it is unlawful business
25025,"I am about, let them depart."
25026,No foot shall stir.
25027,"Music, awake her: strike! [_Music._]"
25028,’Tis time; descend; be stone no more; approach;
25029,Strike all that look upon with marvel. Come;
25030,"I’ll fill your grave up: stir; nay, come away."
25031,"Bequeath to death your numbness, for from him"
25032,Dear life redeems you. You perceive she stirs.
25033,Hermione comes down from the pedestal.
25034,Start not; her actions shall be holy as
25035,You hear my spell is lawful. Do not shun her
25036,Until you see her die again; for then
25037,"You kill her double. Nay, present your hand:"
25038,When she was young you woo’d her; now in age
25039,Is she become the suitor?
25040,"If this be magic, let it be an art"
25041,She hangs about his neck.
25042,"If she pertain to life, let her speak too."
25043,"Ay, and make it manifest where she has liv’d,"
25044,Or how stol’n from the dead.
25045,"That she is living,"
25046,"Were it but told you, should be hooted at"
25047,"Like an old tale; but it appears she lives,"
25048,Though yet she speak not. Mark a little while.
25049,"Please you to interpose, fair madam. Kneel"
25050,"And pray your mother’s blessing. Turn, good lady,"
25051,Our Perdita is found.
25052,"You gods, look down,"
25053,And from your sacred vials pour your graces
25054,"Upon my daughter’s head! Tell me, mine own,"
25055,Where hast thou been preserv’d? where liv’d? how found
25056,"Thy father’s court? for thou shalt hear that I,"
25057,Knowing by Paulina that the oracle
25058,"Gave hope thou wast in being, have preserv’d"
25059,Myself to see the issue.
25060,There’s time enough for that;
25061,Lest they desire upon this push to trouble
25062,"Your joys with like relation. Go together,"
25063,You precious winners all; your exultation
25064,"Partake to everyone. I, an old turtle,"
25065,"Will wing me to some wither’d bough, and there"
25066,"My mate, that’s never to be found again,"
25067,Lament till I am lost.
25068,"Thou shouldst a husband take by my consent,"
25069,"As I by thine a wife: this is a match,"
25070,And made between ’s by vows. Thou hast found mine;
25071,"But how, is to be question’d; for I saw her,"
25072,"As I thought, dead; and have in vain said many"
25073,A prayer upon her grave. I’ll not seek far—
25074,"For him, I partly know his mind—to find thee"
25075,"An honourable husband. Come, Camillo,"
25076,"And take her by the hand, whose worth and honesty"
25077,"Is richly noted, and here justified"
25078,"By us, a pair of kings. Let’s from this place."
25079,"What! look upon my brother: both your pardons,"
25080,That e’er I put between your holy looks
25081,"My ill suspicion. This your son-in-law,"
25082,"And son unto the king, whom heavens directing,"
25083,"Is troth-plight to your daughter. Good Paulina,"
25084,Lead us from hence; where we may leisurely
25085,"Each one demand, and answer to his part"
25086,"Perform’d in this wide gap of time, since first"
25087,We were dissever’d. Hastily lead away!
25088,From off a hill whose concave womb reworded
25089,"A plaintful story from a sist’ring vale,"
25090,"My spirits t’attend this double voice accorded,"
25091,And down I laid to list the sad-tun’d tale;
25092,"Ere long espied a fickle maid full pale,"
25093,"Tearing of papers, breaking rings a-twain,"
25094,Storming her world with sorrow’s wind and rain.
25095,"Upon her head a platted hive of straw,"
25096,"Which fortified her visage from the sun,"
25097,Whereon the thought might think sometime it saw
25098,The carcass of a beauty spent and done;
25099,"Time had not scythed all that youth begun,"
25100,"Nor youth all quit, but spite of heaven’s fell rage"
25101,Some beauty peeped through lattice of sear’d age.
25102,"Oft did she heave her napkin to her eyne,"
25103,"Which on it had conceited characters,"
25104,Laund’ring the silken figures in the brine
25105,"That seasoned woe had pelleted in tears,"
25106,And often reading what contents it bears;
25107,"As often shrieking undistinguish’d woe,"
25108,"In clamours of all size, both high and low."
25109,"Sometimes her levell’d eyes their carriage ride,"
25110,As they did batt’ry to the spheres intend;
25111,Sometime diverted their poor balls are tied
25112,To th’orbed earth; sometimes they do extend
25113,Their view right on; anon their gazes lend
25114,"To every place at once, and nowhere fix’d,"
25115,The mind and sight distractedly commix’d.
25116,"Her hair, nor loose nor tied in formal plat,"
25117,Proclaim’d in her a careless hand of pride;
25118,"For some untuck’d descended her sheav’d hat,"
25119,Hanging her pale and pined cheek beside;
25120,"Some in her threaden fillet still did bide,"
25121,"And, true to bondage, would not break from thence,"
25122,Though slackly braided in loose negligence.
25123,"A thousand favours from a maund she drew,"
25124,"Of amber, crystal, and of beaded jet,"
25125,"Which one by one she in a river threw,"
25126,"Upon whose weeping margent she was set,"
25127,"Like usury applying wet to wet,"
25128,"Or monarchs’ hands, that lets not bounty fall"
25129,"Where want cries ‘some,’ but where excess begs ‘all’."
25130,"Of folded schedules had she many a one,"
25131,"Which she perus’d, sigh’d, tore and gave the flood;"
25132,"Crack’d many a ring of posied gold and bone,"
25133,Bidding them find their sepulchres in mud;
25134,"Found yet mo letters sadly penn’d in blood,"
25135,"With sleided silk, feat and affectedly"
25136,"Enswath’d, and seal’d to curious secrecy."
25137,"These often bath’d she in her fluxive eyes,"
25138,"And often kiss’d, and often gave to tear;"
25139,"Cried, ‘O false blood, thou register of lies,"
25140,What unapproved witness dost thou bear!
25141,Ink would have seem’d more black and damned here!’
25142,"This said, in top of rage the lines she rents,"
25143,Big discontent so breaking their contents.
25144,"A reverend man that grazed his cattle nigh,"
25145,"Sometime a blusterer, that the ruffle knew"
25146,"Of court, of city, and had let go by"
25147,"The swiftest hours observed as they flew,"
25148,Towards this afflicted fancy fastly drew;
25149,"And, privileg’d by age, desires to know"
25150,In brief the grounds and motives of her woe.
25151,"So slides he down upon his grained bat,"
25152,"And comely distant sits he by her side,"
25153,"When he again desires her, being sat,"
25154,Her grievance with his hearing to divide:
25155,If that from him there may be aught applied
25156,"Which may her suffering ecstasy assuage,"
25157,’Tis promised in the charity of age.
25158,"‘Father,’ she says, ‘though in me you behold"
25159,"The injury of many a blasting hour,"
25160,"Let it not tell your judgement I am old,"
25161,"Not age, but sorrow, over me hath power."
25162,"I might as yet have been a spreading flower,"
25163,"Fresh to myself, if I had self-applied"
25164,"Love to myself, and to no love beside."
25165,‘But woe is me! Too early I attended
25166,A youthful suit; it was to gain my grace;
25167,"O one by nature’s outwards so commended,"
25168,"That maiden’s eyes stuck over all his face,"
25169,Love lack’d a dwelling and made him her place;
25170,"And when in his fair parts she did abide,"
25171,She was new lodg’d and newly deified.
25172,"‘His browny locks did hang in crooked curls,"
25173,And every light occasion of the wind
25174,"Upon his lips their silken parcels hurls,"
25175,"What’s sweet to do, to do will aptly find,"
25176,Each eye that saw him did enchant the mind:
25177,"For on his visage was in little drawn,"
25178,What largeness thinks in paradise was sawn.
25179,‘Small show of man was yet upon his chin;
25180,"His phoenix down began but to appear,"
25181,"Like unshorn velvet, on that termless skin,"
25182,Whose bare out-bragg’d the web it seemed to wear.
25183,"Yet show’d his visage by that cost more dear,"
25184,And nice affections wavering stood in doubt
25185,"If best were as it was, or best without."
25186,"‘His qualities were beauteous as his form,"
25187,"For maiden-tongued he was, and thereof free;"
25188,"Yet if men mov’d him, was he such a storm"
25189,"As oft ’twixt May and April is to see,"
25190,"When winds breathe sweet, unruly though they be."
25191,His rudeness so with his authoriz’d youth
25192,Did livery falseness in a pride of truth.
25193,"‘Well could he ride, and often men would say"
25194,"That horse his mettle from his rider takes,"
25195,"Proud of subjection, noble by the sway,"
25196,"What rounds, what bounds, what course, what stop he makes!"
25197,"And controversy hence a question takes,"
25198,"Whether the horse by him became his deed,"
25199,Or he his manage by th’ well-doing steed.
25200,"‘But quickly on this side the verdict went,"
25201,His real habitude gave life and grace
25202,"To appertainings and to ornament,"
25203,"Accomplish’d in himself, not in his case;"
25204,"All aids, themselves made fairer by their place,"
25205,Came for additions; yet their purpos’d trim
25206,"Piec’d not his grace, but were all grac’d by him."
25207,‘So on the tip of his subduing tongue
25208,"All kind of arguments and question deep,"
25209,"All replication prompt, and reason strong,"
25210,"For his advantage still did wake and sleep,"
25211,"To make the weeper laugh, the laugher weep:"
25212,"He had the dialect and different skill,"
25213,Catching all passions in his craft of will.
25214,‘That he did in the general bosom reign
25215,"Of young, of old, and sexes both enchanted,"
25216,"To dwell with him in thoughts, or to remain"
25217,"In personal duty, following where he haunted,"
25218,"Consent’s bewitch’d, ere he desire, have granted,"
25219,"And dialogued for him what he would say,"
25220,"Ask’d their own wills, and made their wills obey."
25221,‘Many there were that did his picture get
25222,"To serve their eyes, and in it put their mind,"
25223,Like fools that in th’ imagination set
25224,The goodly objects which abroad they find
25225,"Of lands and mansions, theirs in thought assign’d,"
25226,"And labouring in moe pleasures to bestow them,"
25227,Than the true gouty landlord which doth owe them.
25228,"‘So many have, that never touch’d his hand,"
25229,Sweetly suppos’d them mistress of his heart.
25230,"My woeful self that did in freedom stand,"
25231,And was my own fee-simple (not in part)
25232,"What with his art in youth, and youth in art,"
25233,"Threw my affections in his charmed power,"
25234,Reserv’d the stalk and gave him all my flower.
25235,"‘Yet did I not, as some my equals did,"
25236,"Demand of him, nor being desired yielded,"
25237,"Finding myself in honour so forbid,"
25238,With safest distance I mine honour shielded.
25239,Experience for me many bulwarks builded
25240,"Of proofs new-bleeding, which remain’d the foil"
25241,"Of this false jewel, and his amorous spoil."
25242,‘But ah! Who ever shunn’d by precedent
25243,"The destin’d ill she must herself assay,"
25244,"Or force’d examples ’gainst her own content,"
25245,To put the by-pass’d perils in her way?
25246,Counsel may stop a while what will not stay:
25247,"For when we rage, advice is often seen"
25248,By blunting us to make our wills more keen.
25249,"‘Nor gives it satisfaction to our blood,"
25250,"That we must curb it upon others’ proof,"
25251,"To be forbode the sweets that seems so good,"
25252,For fear of harms that preach in our behoof.
25253,"O appetite, from judgement stand aloof!"
25254,"The one a palate hath that needs will taste,"
25255,"Though reason weep and cry, “It is thy last.”"
25256,"‘For further I could say, “This man’s untrue”,"
25257,And knew the patterns of his foul beguiling;
25258,"Heard where his plants in others’ orchards grew,"
25259,Saw how deceits were gilded in his smiling;
25260,Knew vows were ever brokers to defiling;
25261,"Thought characters and words merely but art,"
25262,And bastards of his foul adulterate heart.
25263,"‘And long upon these terms I held my city,"
25264,"Till thus he ’gan besiege me: “Gentle maid,"
25265,"Have of my suffering youth some feeling pity,"
25266,And be not of my holy vows afraid:
25267,"That’s to ye sworn, to none was ever said,"
25268,"For feasts of love I have been call’d unto,"
25269,"Till now did ne’er invite, nor never woo."
25270,‘“All my offences that abroad you see
25271,"Are errors of the blood, none of the mind:"
25272,"Love made them not; with acture they may be,"
25273,"Where neither party is nor true nor kind,"
25274,"They sought their shame that so their shame did find,"
25275,"And so much less of shame in me remains,"
25276,By how much of me their reproach contains.
25277,"‘“Among the many that mine eyes have seen,"
25278,"Not one whose flame my heart so much as warmed,"
25279,"Or my affection put to th’ smallest teen,"
25280,Or any of my leisures ever charmed:
25281,"Harm have I done to them, but ne’er was harmed;"
25282,"Kept hearts in liveries, but mine own was free,"
25283,And reign’d commanding in his monarchy.
25284,"‘“Look here what tributes wounded fancies sent me,"
25285,"Of pallid pearls and rubies red as blood,"
25286,Figuring that they their passions likewise lent me
25287,"Of grief and blushes, aptly understood"
25288,In bloodless white and the encrimson’d mood;
25289,"Effects of terror and dear modesty,"
25290,"Encamp’d in hearts, but fighting outwardly."
25291,"‘“And, lo! behold these talents of their hair,"
25292,"With twisted metal amorously empleach’d,"
25293,"I have receiv’d from many a several fair,"
25294,"Their kind acceptance weepingly beseech’d,"
25295,"With th’ annexions of fair gems enrich’d,"
25296,And deep-brain’d sonnets that did amplify
25297,"Each stone’s dear nature, worth and quality."
25298,"‘“The diamond, why ’twas beautiful and hard,"
25299,"Whereto his invis’d properties did tend,"
25300,"The deep green emerald, in whose fresh regard"
25301,Weak sights their sickly radiance do amend;
25302,The heaven-hued sapphire and the opal blend
25303,"With objects manifold; each several stone,"
25304,"With wit well blazon’d smil’d, or made some moan."
25305,"‘“Lo, all these trophies of affections hot,"
25306,"Of pensiv’d and subdued desires the tender,"
25307,"Nature hath charg’d me that I hoard them not,"
25308,"But yield them up where I myself must render,"
25309,"That is, to you, my origin and ender:"
25310,"For these of force must your oblations be,"
25311,"Since I their altar, you empatron me."
25312,"‘“O then advance of yours that phraseless hand,"
25313,Whose white weighs down the airy scale of praise;
25314,"Take all these similes to your own command,"
25315,Hallowed with sighs that burning lungs did raise:
25316,"What me, your minister for you, obeys,"
25317,Works under you; and to your audit comes
25318,Their distract parcels in combined sums.
25319,"‘“Lo, this device was sent me from a nun,"
25320,"Or sister sanctified of holiest note,"
25321,"Which late her noble suit in court did shun,"
25322,Whose rarest havings made the blossoms dote;
25323,"For she was sought by spirits of richest coat,"
25324,"But kept cold distance, and did thence remove"
25325,To spend her living in eternal love.
25326,"‘“But O, my sweet, what labour is’t to leave"
25327,"The thing we have not, mast’ring what not strives,"
25328,"Planing the place which did no form receive,"
25329,"Playing patient sports in unconstrained gyves,"
25330,"She that her fame so to herself contrives,"
25331,"The scars of battle ’scapeth by the flight,"
25332,"And makes her absence valiant, not her might."
25333,"‘“O pardon me, in that my boast is true,"
25334,"The accident which brought me to her eye,"
25335,"Upon the moment did her force subdue,"
25336,And now she would the caged cloister fly:
25337,Religious love put out religion’s eye:
25338,"Not to be tempted would she be immur’d,"
25339,"And now to tempt all, liberty procur’d."
25340,"‘“How mighty then you are, O hear me tell!"
25341,The broken bosoms that to me belong
25342,"Have emptied all their fountains in my well,"
25343,And mine I pour your ocean all among:
25344,"I strong o’er them, and you o’er me being strong,"
25345,"Must for your victory us all congest,"
25346,As compound love to physic your cold breast.
25347,"‘“My parts had pow’r to charm a sacred nun,"
25348,"Who, disciplin’d and dieted in grace,"
25349,"Believ’d her eyes when they t’assail begun,"
25350,All vows and consecrations giving place.
25351,"O most potential love! Vow, bond, nor space,"
25352,"In thee hath neither sting, knot, nor confine,"
25353,For thou art all and all things else are thine.
25354,"‘“When thou impressest, what are precepts worth"
25355,"Of stale example? When thou wilt inflame,"
25356,"How coldly those impediments stand forth,"
25357,"Of wealth, of filial fear, law, kindred, fame!"
25358,"Love’s arms are peace, ’gainst rule, ’gainst sense, ’gainst shame,"
25359,"And sweetens, in the suff’ring pangs it bears,"
25360,"The aloes of all forces, shocks and fears."
25361,"‘“Now all these hearts that do on mine depend,"
25362,"Feeling it break, with bleeding groans they pine,"
25363,"And supplicant their sighs to your extend,"
25364,"To leave the batt’ry that you make ’gainst mine,"
25365,"Lending soft audience to my sweet design,"
25366,"And credent soul to that strong-bonded oath,"
25367,That shall prefer and undertake my troth.”
25368,"‘This said, his wat’ry eyes he did dismount,"
25369,Whose sights till then were levell’d on my face;
25370,Each cheek a river running from a fount
25371,With brinish current downward flowed apace.
25372,O how the channel to the stream gave grace!
25373,"Who, glaz’d with crystal gate the glowing roses"
25374,That flame through water which their hue encloses.
25375,"‘O father, what a hell of witchcraft lies"
25376,In the small orb of one particular tear!
25377,But with the inundation of the eyes
25378,What rocky heart to water will not wear?
25379,What breast so cold that is not warmed here?
25380,"O cleft effect! Cold modesty, hot wrath,"
25381,Both fire from hence and chill extincture hath.
25382,"‘For lo, his passion, but an art of craft,"
25383,Even there resolv’d my reason into tears;
25384,"There my white stole of chastity I daff’d,"
25385,"Shook off my sober guards, and civil fears,"
25386,"Appear to him as he to me appears,"
25387,"All melting, though our drops this diff’rence bore:"
25388,"His poison’d me, and mine did him restore."
25389,"‘In him a plenitude of subtle matter,"
25390,"Applied to cautels, all strange forms receives,"
25391,"Of burning blushes, or of weeping water,"
25392,"Or swooning paleness; and he takes and leaves,"
25393,"In either’s aptness, as it best deceives,"
25394,"To blush at speeches rank, to weep at woes,"
25395,Or to turn white and swoon at tragic shows.
25396,‘That not a heart which in his level came
25397,"Could ’scape the hail of his all-hurting aim,"
25398,Showing fair nature is both kind and tame;
25399,"And veil’d in them, did win whom he would maim."
25400,Against the thing he sought he would exclaim;
25401,"When he most burned in heart-wish’d luxury,"
25402,"He preach’d pure maid, and prais’d cold chastity."
25403,"‘Thus merely with the garment of a grace,"
25404,"The naked and concealed fiend he cover’d,"
25405,"That th’unexperient gave the tempter place,"
25406,"Which, like a cherubin, above them hover’d."
25407,"Who, young and simple, would not be so lover’d?"
25408,"Ay me! I fell, and yet do question make"
25409,What I should do again for such a sake.
25410,"‘O, that infected moisture of his eye,"
25411,"O, that false fire which in his cheek so glow’d!"
25412,"O, that forc’d thunder from his heart did fly,"
25413,"O, that sad breath his spongy lungs bestow’d,"
25414,"O, all that borrowed motion, seeming owed,"
25415,"Would yet again betray the fore-betrayed,"
25416,And new pervert a reconciled maid.’
25417,"When my love swears that she is made of truth,"
25418,"I do believe her, though I know she lies,"
25419,"That she might think me some untutor’d youth,"
25420,Unskilful in the world’s false forgeries.
25421,"Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,"
25422,"Although I know my years be past the best,"
25423,"I smiling credit her false-speaking tongue,"
25424,Outfacing faults in love with love’s ill rest.
25425,But wherefore says my love that she is young?
25426,And wherefore say not I that I am old?
25427,"O, love’s best habit is a soothing tongue,"
25428,"And age, in love, loves not to have years told."
25429,"Therefore, I’ll lie with love, and love with me,"
25430,Since that our faults in love thus smother’d be.
25431,"Two loves I have, of comfort and despair,"
25432,That like two spirits do suggest me still;
25433,"My better angel is a man right fair,"
25434,My worser spirit a woman colour’d ill.
25435,"To win me soon to hell, my female evil"
25436,"Tempteth my better angel from my side,"
25437,"And would corrupt my saint to be a devil,"
25438,Wooing his purity with her fair pride.
25439,"And whether that my angel be turn’d fiend,"
25440,"Suspect I may, yet not directly tell;"
25441,"For being both to me, both to each friend,"
25442,I guess one angel in another’s hell:
25443,"The truth I shall not know, but live in doubt,"
25444,Till my bad angel fire my good one out.
25445,"Did not the heavenly rhetoric of thine eye,"
25446,"’Gainst whom the world could not hold argument,"
25447,Persuade my heart to this false perjury?
25448,Vows for thee broke deserve not punishment.
25449,"A woman I forswore; but I will prove,"
25450,"Thou being a goddess, I forswore not thee:"
25451,"My vow was earthly, thou a heavenly love;"
25452,Thy grace being gain’d cures all disgrace in me.
25453,"My vow was breath, and breath a vapour is;"
25454,"Then, thou fair sun, that on this earth doth shine,"
25455,Exhale this vapour vow; in thee it is;
25456,"If broken then, it is no fault of mine."
25457,"If by me broke, what fool is not so wise"
25458,"To break an oath, to win a paradise?"
25459,"Sweet Cytherea, sitting by a brook"
25460,"With young Adonis, lovely, fresh and green,"
25461,"Did court the lad with many a lovely look,"
25462,Such looks as none could look but beauty’s queen.
25463,She told him stories to delight his ear;
25464,She show’d him favours to allure his eye;
25465,"To win his heart, she touch’d him here and there;"
25466,Touches so soft still conquer chastity.
25467,"But whether unripe years did want conceit,"
25468,"Or he refus’d to take her figur’d proffer,"
25469,"The tender nibbler would not touch the bait,"
25470,But smile and jest at every gentle offer.
25471,"Then fell she on her back, fair queen, and toward:"
25472,"He rose and ran away; ah, fool too froward!"
25473,"If love make me forsworn, how shall I swear to love?"
25474,"O never faith could hold, if not to beauty vowed."
25475,"Though to myself forsworn, to thee I’ll constant prove;"
25476,"Those thoughts, to me like oaks, to thee like osiers bowed."
25477,"Study his bias leaves, and makes his book thine eyes,"
25478,Where all those pleasures live that art can comprehend.
25479,"If knowledge be the mark, to know thee shall suffice;"
25480,"Well learned is that tongue that well can thee commend,"
25481,All ignorant that soul that sees thee without wonder;
25482,"Which is to me some praise, that I thy parts admire."
25483,"Thine eye Jove’s lightning seems, thy voice his dreadful thunder,"
25484,"Which, not to anger bent, is music and sweet fire."
25485,"Celestial as thou art, O do not love that wrong,"
25486,To sing heaven’s praise with such an earthly tongue.
25487,"Scarce had the sun dried up the dewy morn,"
25488,"And scarce the herd gone to the hedge for shade,"
25489,"When Cytherea, all in love forlorn,"
25490,A longing tarriance for Adonis made
25491,"Under an osier growing by a brook,"
25492,A brook where Adon used to cool his spleen.
25493,Hot was the day; she hotter that did look
25494,"For his approach, that often there had been."
25495,"Anon he comes, and throws his mantle by,"
25496,And stood stark naked on the brook’s green brim:
25497,"The sun look’d on the world with glorious eye,"
25498,Yet not so wistly as this queen on him.
25499,"He, spying her, bounc’d in, whereas he stood,"
25500,"“O Jove,” quoth she, “why was not I a flood?”"
25501,"Fair is my love, but not so fair as fickle,"
25502,"Mild as a dove, but neither true nor trusty,"
25503,"Brighter than glass, and yet, as glass is, brittle,"
25504,"Softer than wax, and yet, as iron, rusty:"
25505,"A lily pale, with damask dye to grace her,"
25506,"None fairer, nor none falser to deface her."
25507,"Her lips to mine how often hath she joined,"
25508,Between each kiss her oaths of true love swearing!
25509,"How many tales to please me hath she coined,"
25510,"Dreading my love, the loss thereof still fearing!"
25511,"Yet in the midst of all her pure protestings,"
25512,"Her faith, her oaths, her tears, and all were jestings."
25513,"She burnt with love, as straw with fire flameth;"
25514,"She burnt out love, as soon as straw out-burneth;"
25515,"She fram’d the love, and yet she foil’d the framing;"
25516,"She bade love last, and yet she fell a-turning."
25517,"Was this a lover, or a lecher whether?"
25518,"Bad in the best, though excellent in neither."
25519,"If music and sweet poetry agree,"
25520,"As they must needs, the sister and the brother,"
25521,"Then must the love be great ’twixt thee and me,"
25522,Because thou lov’st the one and I the other.
25523,"Dowland to thee is dear, whose heavenly touch"
25524,Upon the lute doth ravish human sense;
25525,"Spenser to me, whose deep conceit is such"
25526,"As passing all conceit, needs no defence."
25527,Thou lov’st to hear the sweet melodious sound
25528,"That Phœbus’ lute, the queen of music, makes;"
25529,And I in deep delight am chiefly drown’d
25530,Whenas himself to singing he betakes.
25531,"One god is god of both, as poets feign;"
25532,"One knight loves both, and both in thee remain."
25533,"Fair was the morn when the fair queen of love,"
25534,*        *        *        *        *        *
25535,"Paler for sorrow than her milk-white dove,"
25536,"For Adon’s sake, a youngster proud and wild;"
25537,Her stand she takes upon a steep-up hill;
25538,Anon Adonis comes with horn and hounds;
25539,"She, silly queen, with more than love’s good will,"
25540,Forbade the boy he should not pass those grounds.
25541,"“Once,” quoth she, “did I see a fair sweet youth"
25542,"Here in these brakes deep-wounded with a boar,"
25543,"Deep in the thigh, a spectacle of ruth!"
25544,"See in my thigh,” quoth she, “here was the sore.”"
25545,"She showed hers: he saw more wounds than one,"
25546,"And blushing fled, and left her all alone."
25547,"Sweet rose, fair flower, untimely pluck’d, soon vaded,"
25548,Pluck’d in the bud and vaded in the spring!
25549,"Bright orient pearl, alack, too timely shaded!"
25550,"Fair creature, kill’d too soon by death’s sharp sting!"
25551,"Like a green plum that hangs upon a tree,"
25552,"And falls, through wind, before the fall should be."
25553,"I weep for thee, and yet no cause I have;"
25554,For why thou left’st me nothing in thy will;
25555,And yet thou left’st me more than I did crave;
25556,For why I craved nothing of thee still.
25557,"O yes, dear friend, I pardon crave of thee,"
25558,Thy discontent thou didst bequeath to me.
25559,"Venus, with young Adonis sitting by her"
25560,"Under a myrtle shade, began to woo him;"
25561,"She told the youngling how god Mars did try her,"
25562,"And as he fell to her, she fell to him."
25563,"“Even thus,” quoth she, “the warlike god embrac’d me,”"
25564,And then she clipp’d Adonis in her arms;
25565,"“Even thus,” quoth she, “the warlike god unlaced me;”"
25566,As if the boy should use like loving charms;
25567,"“Even thus,” quoth she, “he seized on my lips,”"
25568,And with her lips on his did act the seizure;
25569,"And as she fetched breath, away he skips,"
25570,And would not take her meaning nor her pleasure.
25571,"Ah, that I had my lady at this bay,"
25572,To kiss and clip me till I run away!
25573,Crabbed age and youth cannot live together:
25574,"Youth is full of pleasance, age is full of care;"
25575,"Youth like summer morn, age like winter weather;"
25576,"Youth like summer brave, age like winter bare."
25577,"Youth is full of sport, age’s breath is short;"
25578,"Youth is nimble, age is lame;"
25579,"Youth is hot and bold, age is weak and cold;"
25580,"Youth is wild, and age is tame."
25581,"Age, I do abhor thee; youth, I do adore thee;"
25582,"O, my love, my love is young!"
25583,"Age, I do defy thee. O, sweet shepherd, hie thee,"
25584,For methinks thou stay’st too long.
25585,"Beauty is but a vain and doubtful good,"
25586,A shining gloss that vadeth suddenly;
25587,A flower that dies when first it ’gins to bud;
25588,A brittle glass that’s broken presently:
25589,"A doubtful good, a gloss, a glass, a flower,"
25590,"Lost, vaded, broken, dead within an hour."
25591,"And as goods lost are seld or never found,"
25592,"As vaded gloss no rubbing will refresh,"
25593,"As flowers dead lie wither’d on the ground,"
25594,"As broken glass no cement can redress,"
25595,"So beauty blemish’d once, for ever’s lost,"
25596,"In spite of physic, painting, pain and cost."
25597,"Good night, good rest. Ah, neither be my share:"
25598,She bade good night that kept my rest away;
25599,"And daff’d me to a cabin hang’d with care,"
25600,To descant on the doubts of my decay.
25601,"“Farewell,” quoth she, “and come again tomorrow:”"
25602,"Fare well I could not, for I supp’d with sorrow."
25603,"Yet at my parting sweetly did she smile,"
25604,"In scorn or friendship, nill I conster whether:"
25605,"’T may be, she joy’d to jest at my exile,"
25606,"’T may be, again to make me wander thither:"
25607,"“Wander,” a word for shadows like myself,"
25608,"As take the pain, but cannot pluck the pelf."
25609,"Lord, how mine eyes throw gazes to the east!"
25610,My heart doth charge the watch; the morning rise
25611,Doth cite each moving sense from idle rest.
25612,"Not daring trust the office of mine eyes,"
25613,"While Philomela sits and sings, I sit and mark,"
25614,And wish her lays were tuned like the lark.
25615,"For she doth welcome daylight with her ditty,"
25616,And drives away dark dreaming night.
25617,"The night so pack’d, I post unto my pretty;"
25618,Heart hath his hope and eyes their wished sight;
25619,"Sorrow chang’d to solace, solace mix’d with sorrow;"
25620,"For why, she sigh’d, and bade me come tomorrow."
25621,"Were I with her, the night would post too soon;"
25622,But now are minutes added to the hours;
25623,"To spite me now, each minute seems a moon;"
25624,"Yet not for me, shine sun to succour flowers!"
25625,"Pack night, peep day; good day, of night now borrow:"
25626,"Short, night, tonight, and length thyself tomorrow."
25627,"It was a lording’s daughter, the fairest one of three,"
25628,"That liked of her master as well as well might be,"
25629,"Till looking on an Englishman, the fairest that eye could see,"
25630,Her fancy fell a-turning.
25631,"Long was the combat doubtful, that love with love did fight,"
25632,"To leave the master loveless, or kill the gallant knight;"
25633,"To put in practice either, alas, it was a spite"
25634,Unto the silly damsel!
25635,"But one must be refused; more mickle was the pain,"
25636,"That nothing could be used to turn them both to gain,"
25637,For of the two the trusty knight was wounded with disdain:
25638,Alas she could not help it!
25639,"Thus art with arms contending was victor of the day,"
25640,Which by a gift of learning did bear the maid away:
25641,"Then lullaby, the learned man hath got the lady gay;"
25642,For now my song is ended.
25643,"On a day, alack the day!"
25644,"Love, whose month was ever May,"
25645,"Spied a blossom passing fair,"
25646,Playing in the wanton air.
25647,Through the velvet leaves the wind
25648,"All unseen ’gan passage find,"
25649,"That the lover, sick to death,"
25650,Wish’d himself the heaven’s breath:
25651,"“Air,” quoth he, “thy cheeks may blow;"
25652,"Air, would I might triumph so!"
25653,"But, alas, my hand hath sworn"
25654,Ne’er to pluck thee from thy thorn:
25655,"Vow, alack, for youth unmeet,"
25656,"Youth, so apt to pluck a sweet!"
25657,Thou for whom Jove would swear
25658,"Juno but an Ethiope were,"
25659,"And deny himself for Jove,"
25660,Turning mortal for thy love.”
25661,"My flocks feed not, my ewes breed not,"
25662,"My rams speed not, all is amis:"
25663,"Love is dying, faith’s defying,"
25664,"Heart’s denying, causer of this."
25665,"All my merry jigs are quite forgot,"
25666,"All my lady’s love is lost, God wot:"
25667,"Where her faith was firmely fix’d in love,"
25668,There a nay is plac’d without remove.
25669,One silly cross wrought all my loss;
25670,"O frowning fortune, cursed fickle dame!"
25671,For now I see inconstancy
25672,More in women than in men remain.
25673,"In black mourn I, all fears scorn I,"
25674,"Love hath forlorn me, living in thrall."
25675,"Heart is bleeding, all help needing,"
25676,"O cruel speeding, fraughted with gall."
25677,My shepherd’s pipe can sound no deal.
25678,My weather’s bell rings doleful knell;
25679,"My curtal dog that wont to have play’d,"
25680,"Plays not at all, but seems afraid."
25681,"With sighs so deep procures to weep,"
25682,"In howling wise, to see my doleful plight."
25683,"How sighs resound through heartless ground,"
25684,Like a thousand vanquish’d men in bloody fight!
25685,"Clear wells spring not, sweet birds sing not,"
25686,Green plants bring not forth their dye;
25687,"Herds stands weeping, flocks all sleeping,"
25688,Nymphs black peeping fearfully.
25689,"All our pleasure known to us poor swains,"
25690,"All our merry meetings on the plains,"
25691,"All our evening sport from us is fled,"
25692,"All our love is lost, for love is dead."
25693,"Farewel, sweet love, thy like ne’er was"
25694,"For a sweet content, the cause of all my woe!"
25695,Poor Corydon must live alone;
25696,Other help for him I see that there is none.
25697,"Whenas thine eye hath chose the dame,"
25698,"And stall’d the deer that thou shouldst strike,"
25699,"Let reason rule things worthy blame,"
25700,"As well as fancy, partial might;"
25701,"Take counsel of some wiser head,"
25702,Neither too young nor yet unwed.
25703,"And when thou com’st thy tale to tell,"
25704,"Smooth not thy tongue with filed talk,"
25705,"Least she some subtle practice smell,—"
25706,"A cripple soon can find a halt,—"
25707,"But plainly say thou lov’st her well,"
25708,And set her person forth to sale.
25709,"What though her frowning brows be bent,"
25710,"Her cloudy looks will calm ere night,"
25711,"And then too late she will repent,"
25712,That thus dissembled her delight;
25713,"And twice desire, ere it be day,"
25714,That which with scorn she put away.
25715,"What though she strive to try her strength,"
25716,"And ban and brawl, and say thee nay,"
25717,"Her feeble force will yield at length,"
25718,When craft hath taught her thus to say:
25719,"“Had women been so strong as men,"
25720,"In faith, you had not had it then.”"
25721,And to her will frame all thy ways;
25722,"Spare not to spend, and chiefly there"
25723,"Where thy desert may merit praise,"
25724,By ringing in thy lady’s ear:
25725,"The strongest castle, tower and town,"
25726,The golden bullet beats it down.
25727,"Serve always with assured trust,"
25728,And in thy suit be humble true;
25729,"Unless thy lady prove unjust,"
25730,Press never thou to choose a new:
25731,"When time shall serve, be thou not slack,"
25732,"To proffer, though she put thee back."
25733,"The wiles and guiles that women work,"
25734,"Dissembled with an outward show,"
25735,"The tricks and toys that in them lurk,"
25736,"The cock that treads them shall not know,"
25737,"Have you not heard it said full oft,"
25738,A woman’s nay doth stand for nought.
25739,"Think women still to strive with men,"
25740,To sin and never for to saint:
25741,"There is no heaven, by holy then,"
25742,"When time with age shall them attaint,"
25743,"Were kisses all the joys in bed,"
25744,One woman would another wed.
25745,"But soft, enough,—too much,—I fear"
25746,Lest that my mistress hear my song:
25747,"She will not stick to round me on th’ ear,"
25748,To teach my tongue to be so long.
25749,"Yet will she blush, here be it said,"
25750,To hear her secrets so bewray’d.
25751,"Live with me and be my love,"
25752,And we will all the pleasures prove
25753,"That hills and valleys, dales and fields,"
25754,And all the craggy mountains yield.
25755,"There will we sit upon the rocks,"
25756,"And see the shepherds feed their flocks,"
25757,"By shallow rivers, by whose falls"
25758,Melodious birds sing madrigals.
25759,"There will I make thee a bed of roses,"
25760,"With a thousand fragrant posies,"
25761,"A cap of flowers, and a kirtle"
25762,Embroidered all with leaves of myrtle.
25763,"A belt of straw and ivy buds,"
25764,With coral clasps and amber studs;
25765,"And if these pleasures may thee move,"
25766,Then live with me and be my love.
25767,"If that the world and love were young,"
25768,"And truth in every shepherd’s tongue,"
25769,These pretty pleasures might me move
25770,To live with thee and be thy love.
25771,As it fell upon a day
25772,"In the merry month of May,"
25773,Sitting in a pleasant shade
25774,"Which a grove of myrtles made,"
25775,"Beasts did leap and birds did sing,"
25776,Trees did grow and plants did spring;
25777,"Everything did banish moan,"
25778,Save the nightingale alone:
25779,"She, poor bird, as all forlorn,"
25780,"Lean’d her breast up-till a thorn,"
25781,"And there sung the dolefull’st ditty,"
25782,That to hear it was great pitty.
25783,"“Fie, fie, fie,” now would she cry,"
25784,"“Tereu, Tereu,” by and by;"
25785,"That to hear her so complain,"
25786,"Scarce I could from tears refrain,"
25787,For her griefs so lively shown
25788,Made me think upon mine own.
25789,"Ah, thought I, thou mourn’st in vain!"
25790,None takes pitty on thy pain.
25791,"Senseless trees they cannot hear thee,"
25792,Ruthless bears they will not cheer thee;
25793,"King Pandion he is dead,"
25794,"All thy friends are lapp’d in lead,"
25795,"All thy fellow birds do sing,"
25796,Careless of thy sorrowing.
25797,"Whilst as fickle fortune smiled,"
25798,Thou and I were both beguiled.
25799,Every one that flatters thee
25800,Is no friend in misery.
25801,"Words are easy, like the wind;"
25802,Faithful friends are hard to find.
25803,Every man will be thy friend
25804,Whilst thou hast wherewith to spend;
25805,"But if store of crowns be scant,"
25806,No man will supply thy want.
25807,"If that one be prodigal,"
25808,"Bountiful they will him call,"
25809,"And with such-like flattering,"
25810,“Pity but he were a king.”
25811,"If he be addict to vice,"
25812,Quickly him they will entice;
25813,"If to women he be bent,"
25814,They have at commandement.
25815,"But if Fortune once do frown,"
25816,Then farewell his great renown.
25817,"They that fawn’d on him before,"
25818,Use his company no more.
25819,"He that is thy friend indeed,"
25820,He will help thee in thy need:
25821,"If thou sorrow, he will weep;"
25822,"If thou wake, he cannot sleep."
25823,Thus of every grief in heart
25824,He with thee doth bear a part.
25825,These are certain signs to know
25826,Faithful friend from flatt’ring foe.
25827,"Let the bird of loudest lay,"
25828,"On the sole Arabian tree,"
25829,"Herald sad and trumpet be,"
25830,To whose sound chaste wings obey.
25831,"But thou shrieking harbinger,"
25832,"Foul precurrer of the fiend,"
25833,"Augur of the fever’s end,"
25834,To this troop come thou not near.
25835,From this session interdict
25836,"Every fowl of tyrant wing,"
25837,"Save the eagle, feather’d king;"
25838,Keep the obsequy so strict.
25839,"Let the priest in surplice white,"
25840,"That defunctive music can,"
25841,"Be the death-divining swan,"
25842,Lest the requiem lack his right.
25843,"And thou treble-dated crow,"
25844,That thy sable gender mak’st
25845,"With the breath thou giv’st and tak’st,"
25846,’Mongst our mourners shalt thou go.
25847,Here the anthem doth commence:
25848,Love and constancy is dead;
25849,Phoenix and the turtle fled
25850,In a mutual flame from hence.
25851,"So they lov’d, as love in twain"
25852,Had the essence but in one;
25853,"Two distincts, division none:"
25854,Number there in love was slain.
25855,"Hearts remote, yet not asunder;"
25856,Distance and no space was seen
25857,’Twixt this turtle and his queen;
25858,But in them it were a wonder.
25859,"So between them love did shine,"
25860,That the turtle saw his right
25861,Flaming in the phoenix’ sight;
25862,Either was the other’s mine.
25863,"Property was thus appalled,"
25864,That the self was not the same;
25865,Single nature’s double name
25866,Neither two nor one was called.
25867,"Reason, in itself confounded,"
25868,Saw division grow together;
25869,"To themselves yet either neither,"
25870,Simple were so well compounded.
25871,"That it cried, How true a twain"
25872,Seemeth this concordant one!
25873,"Love hath reason, reason none,"
25874,If what parts can so remain.
25875,Whereupon it made this threne
25876,"To the phoenix and the dove,"
25877,"Co-supremes and stars of love,"
25878,As chorus to their tragic scene.
25879,"Beauty, truth, and rarity."
25880,"Grace in all simplicity,"
25881,Here enclos’d in cinders lie.
25882,Death is now the phoenix’ nest;
25883,And the turtle’s loyal breast
25884,To eternity doth rest.
25885,"’Twas not their infirmity,"
25886,It was married chastity.
25887,"Truth may seem, but cannot be;"
25888,"Beauty brag, but ’tis not she;"
25889,Truth and beauty buried be.
25890,To this urn let those repair
25891,That are either true or fair;
25892,For these dead birds sigh a prayer.
25893,"HENRY WRIOTHESLEY, EARL OF SOUTHAMPTON,"
25894,and Baron of Titchfield.
25895,The love I dedicate to your Lordship is without end; whereof this
25896,"pamphlet, without beginning, is but a superfluous moiety. The warrant I"
25897,"have of your honourable disposition, not the worth of my untutored"
25898,"lines, makes it assured of acceptance. What I have done is yours; what"
25899,"I have to do is yours; being part in all I have, devoted yours. Were my"
25900,"worth greater, my duty would show greater; meantime, as it is, it is"
25901,"bound to your Lordship, to whom I wish long life, still lengthened with"
25902,"Your Lordship’s in all duty,"
25903,"Lucius Tarquinius (for his excessive pride surnamed Superbus), after he"
25904,"had caused his own father-in-law, Servius Tullius, to be cruelly"
25905,"murdered, and, contrary to the Roman laws and customs, not requiring or"
25906,"staying for the people’s suffrages, had possessed himself of the"
25907,"kingdom, went, accompanied with his sons and other noblemen of Rome, to"
25908,besiege Ardea. During which siege the principal men of the army meeting
25909,"one evening at the tent of Sextus Tarquinius, the king’s son, in their"
25910,"discourses after supper, everyone commended the virtues of his own"
25911,wife; among whom Collatinus extolled the incomparable chastity of his
25912,wife Lucretia. In that pleasant humour they all posted to Rome; and
25913,"intending, by their secret and sudden arrival, to make trial of that"
25914,"which everyone had before avouched, only Collatinus finds his wife,"
25915,"though it were late in the night, spinning amongst her maids: the other"
25916,"ladies were all found dancing and revelling, or in several disports."
25917,"Whereupon the noblemen yielded Collatinus the victory, and his wife the"
25918,fame. At that time Sextus Tarquinius being inflamed with Lucrece’s
25919,"beauty, yet smothering his passions for the present, departed with the"
25920,rest back to the camp; from whence he shortly after privily withdrew
25921,"himself, and was (according to his estate) royally entertained and"
25922,lodged by Lucrece at Collatium. The same night he treacherously
25923,"stealeth into her chamber, violently ravished her, and early in the"
25924,"morning speedeth away. Lucrece, in this lamentable plight, hastily"
25925,"dispatched messengers, one to Rome for her father, another to the camp"
25926,"for Collatine. They came, the one accompanied with Junius Brutus, the"
25927,other with Publius Valerius; and finding Lucrece attired in mourning
25928,"habit, demanded the cause of her sorrow. She, first taking an oath of"
25929,"them for her revenge, revealed the actor, and whole manner of his"
25930,"dealing, and withal suddenly stabbed herself. Which done, with one"
25931,consent they all vowed to root out the whole hated family of the
25932,"Tarquins; and bearing the dead body to Rome, Brutus acquainted the"
25933,"people with the doer and manner of the vile deed, with a bitter"
25934,invective against the tyranny of the king; wherewith the people were so
25935,"moved, that with one consent and a general acclamation the Tarquins"
25936,"were all exiled, and the state government changed from kings to"
25937,"From the besieged Ardea all in post,"
25938,"Borne by the trustless wings of false desire,"
25939,"Lust-breathed Tarquin leaves the Roman host,"
25940,"And to Collatium bears the lightless fire,"
25941,"Which in pale embers hid, lurks to aspire"
25942,And girdle with embracing flames the waist
25943,"Of Collatine’s fair love, Lucrece the chaste."
25944,Haply that name of “chaste” unhapp’ly set
25945,"This bateless edge on his keen appetite,"
25946,When Collatine unwisely did not let
25947,To praise the clear unmatched red and white
25948,Which triumphed in that sky of his delight;
25949,"Where mortal stars as bright as heaven’s beauties,"
25950,With pure aspects did him peculiar duties.
25951,"For he the night before, in Tarquin’s tent"
25952,"Unlocked the treasure of his happy state,"
25953,What priceless wealth the heavens had him lent
25954,In the possession of his beauteous mate;
25955,Reck’ning his fortune at such high proud rate
25956,"That kings might be espoused to more fame,"
25957,But king nor peer to such a peerless dame.
25958,"O happiness enjoyed but of a few,"
25959,"And, if possessed, as soon decayed and done"
25960,As is the morning’s silver melting dew
25961,Against the golden splendour of the sun!
25962,"An expired date, cancelled ere well begun."
25963,"Honour and beauty in the owner’s arms,"
25964,Are weakly fortressed from a world of harms.
25965,Beauty itself doth of itself persuade
25966,The eyes of men without an orator;
25967,"What needeth then apologies be made,"
25968,To set forth that which is so singular?
25969,Or why is Collatine the publisher
25970,Of that rich jewel he should keep unknown
25971,"From thievish ears, because it is his own?"
25972,Perchance his boast of Lucrece’ sov’reignty
25973,Suggested this proud issue of a king;
25974,For by our ears our hearts oft tainted be.
25975,"Perchance that envy of so rich a thing,"
25976,"Braving compare, disdainfully did sting"
25977,"His high-pitched thoughts, that meaner men should vaunt"
25978,That golden hap which their superiors want.
25979,But some untimely thought did instigate
25980,"His all-too-timeless speed, if none of those;"
25981,"His honour, his affairs, his friends, his state,"
25982,"Neglected all, with swift intent he goes"
25983,To quench the coal which in his liver glows.
25984,"O rash false heat, wrapped in repentant cold,"
25985,Thy hasty spring still blasts and ne’er grows old!
25986,"When at Collatium this false lord arrived,"
25987,"Well was he welcomed by the Roman dame,"
25988,Within whose face beauty and virtue strived
25989,Which of them both should underprop her fame.
25990,"When virtue bragged, beauty would blush for shame;"
25991,"When beauty boasted blushes, in despite"
25992,Virtue would stain that o’er with silver white.
25993,"But beauty, in that white intituled"
25994,"From Venus’ doves, doth challenge that fair field."
25995,"Then virtue claims from beauty beauty’s red,"
25996,Which virtue gave the golden age to gild
25997,"Their silver cheeks, and called it then their shield;"
25998,"Teaching them thus to use it in the fight,"
25999,"When shame assailed, the red should fence the white."
26000,"This heraldry in Lucrece’ face was seen,"
26001,Argued by beauty’s red and virtue’s white.
26002,"Of either’s colour was the other queen,"
26003,Proving from world’s minority their right.
26004,Yet their ambition makes them still to fight;
26005,"The sovereignty of either being so great,"
26006,That oft they interchange each other’s seat.
26007,"Their silent war of lilies and of roses,"
26008,"Which Tarquin viewed in her fair face’s field,"
26009,In their pure ranks his traitor eye encloses;
26010,"Where, lest between them both it should be killed,"
26011,The coward captive vanquished doth yield
26012,To those two armies that would let him go
26013,Rather than triumph in so false a foe.
26014,"Now thinks he that her husband’s shallow tongue,"
26015,"The niggard prodigal that praised her so,"
26016,"In that high task hath done her beauty wrong,"
26017,Which far exceeds his barren skill to show.
26018,Therefore that praise which Collatine doth owe
26019,"Enchanted Tarquin answers with surmise,"
26020,In silent wonder of still-gazing eyes.
26021,"This earthly saint, adored by this devil,"
26022,Little suspecteth the false worshipper;
26023,For unstained thoughts do seldom dream on evil;
26024,Birds never limed no secret bushes fear.
26025,So guiltless she securely gives good cheer
26026,"And reverend welcome to her princely guest,"
26027,Whose inward ill no outward harm expressed.
26028,"For that he coloured with his high estate,"
26029,"Hiding base sin in pleats of majesty,"
26030,"That nothing in him seemed inordinate,"
26031,"Save sometime too much wonder of his eye,"
26032,"Which, having all, all could not satisfy;"
26033,"But, poorly rich, so wanteth in his store"
26034,"That, cloyed with much, he pineth still for more."
26035,"But she, that never coped with stranger eyes,"
26036,"Could pick no meaning from their parling looks,"
26037,Nor read the subtle shining secrecies
26038,Writ in the glassy margents of such books;
26039,"She touched no unknown baits, nor feared no hooks,"
26040,"Nor could she moralize his wanton sight,"
26041,More than his eyes were opened to the light.
26042,"He stories to her ears her husband’s fame,"
26043,Won in the fields of fruitful Italy;
26044,"And decks with praises Collatine’s high name,"
26045,Made glorious by his manly chivalry
26046,With bruised arms and wreaths of victory.
26047,"Her joy with heaved-up hand she doth express,"
26048,"And, wordless, so greets heaven for his success."
26049,"Far from the purpose of his coming thither,"
26050,He makes excuses for his being there.
26051,No cloudy show of stormy blust’ring weather
26052,"Doth yet in his fair welkin once appear,"
26053,"Till sable Night, mother of dread and fear,"
26054,"Upon the world dim darkness doth display,"
26055,And in her vaulty prison stows the day.
26056,"For then is Tarquin brought unto his bed,"
26057,Intending weariness with heavy sprite;
26058,For after supper long he questioned
26059,"With modest Lucrece, and wore out the night."
26060,"Now leaden slumber with life’s strength doth fight,"
26061,"And every one to rest themselves betake,"
26062,Save thieves and cares and troubled minds that wake.
26063,As one of which doth Tarquin lie revolving
26064,"The sundry dangers of his will’s obtaining,"
26065,"Yet ever to obtain his will resolving,"
26066,Though weak-built hopes persuade him to abstaining.
26067,"Despair to gain doth traffic oft for gaining,"
26068,"And when great treasure is the meed proposed,"
26069,"Though death be adjunct, there’s no death supposed."
26070,Those that much covet are with gain so fond
26071,"For what they have not, that which they possess"
26072,They scatter and unloose it from their bond;
26073,"And so, by hoping more, they have but less,"
26074,"Or, gaining more, the profit of excess"
26075,"Is but to surfeit, and such griefs sustain,"
26076,That they prove bankrout in this poor-rich gain.
26077,The aim of all is but to nurse the life
26078,"With honour, wealth, and ease, in waning age;"
26079,And in this aim there is such thwarting strife
26080,That one for all or all for one we gage:
26081,"As life for honour in fell battle’s rage,"
26082,Honour for wealth; and oft that wealth doth cost
26083,"The death of all, and all together lost."
26084,So that in vent’ring ill we leave to be
26085,"The things we are, for that which we expect;"
26086,"And this ambitious foul infirmity,"
26087,"In having much, torments us with defect"
26088,Of that we have. So then we do neglect
26089,"The thing we have, and, all for want of wit,"
26090,Make something nothing by augmenting it.
26091,"Such hazard now must doting Tarquin make,"
26092,Pawning his honour to obtain his lust;
26093,And for himself himself he must forsake.
26094,"Then where is truth, if there be no self-trust?"
26095,"When shall he think to find a stranger just,"
26096,"When he himself himself confounds, betrays"
26097,To sland’rous tongues and wretched hateful days?
26098,"Now stole upon the time the dead of night,"
26099,When heavy sleep had closed up mortal eyes.
26100,"No comfortable star did lend his light,"
26101,No noise but owls’ and wolves’ death-boding cries;
26102,Now serves the season that they may surprise
26103,"The silly lambs. Pure thoughts are dead and still,"
26104,While lust and murder wake to stain and kill.
26105,"And now this lustful lord leaped from his bed,"
26106,Throwing his mantle rudely o’er his arm;
26107,Is madly tossed between desire and dread;
26108,"Th’ one sweetly flatters, th’ other feareth harm."
26109,"But honest fear, bewitched with lust’s foul charm,"
26110,"Doth too too oft betake him to retire,"
26111,Beaten away by brain-sick rude desire.
26112,"His falchion on a flint he softly smiteth,"
26113,That from the cold stone sparks of fire do fly;
26114,"Whereat a waxen torch forthwith he lighteth,"
26115,"Which must be lodestar to his lustful eye,"
26116,And to the flame thus speaks advisedly:
26117,"“As from this cold flint I enforced this fire,"
26118,So Lucrece must I force to my desire.”
26119,Here pale with fear he doth premeditate
26120,"The dangers of his loathsome enterprise,"
26121,And in his inward mind he doth debate
26122,What following sorrow may on this arise.
26123,"Then looking scornfully, he doth despise"
26124,"His naked armour of still-slaughtered lust,"
26125,And justly thus controls his thoughts unjust:
26126,"“Fair torch, burn out thy light, and lend it not"
26127,To darken her whose light excelleth thine.
26128,"And die, unhallowed thoughts, before you blot"
26129,With your uncleanness that which is divine.
26130,Offer pure incense to so pure a shrine.
26131,Let fair humanity abhor the deed
26132,That spots and stains love’s modest snow-white weed.
26133,“O shame to knighthood and to shining arms!
26134,O foul dishonour to my household’s grave!
26135,O impious act including all foul harms!
26136,A martial man to be soft fancy’s slave!
26137,True valour still a true respect should have.
26138,"Then my digression is so vile, so base,"
26139,That it will live engraven in my face.
26140,"“Yea, though I die, the scandal will survive"
26141,And be an eye-sore in my golden coat;
26142,"Some loathsome dash the herald will contrive,"
26143,"To cipher me how fondly I did dote,"
26144,"That my posterity, shamed with the note,"
26145,"Shall curse my bones, and hold it for no sin"
26146,To wish that I their father had not been.
26147,“What win I if I gain the thing I seek?
26148,"A dream, a breath, a froth of fleeting joy."
26149,"Who buys a minute’s mirth to wail a week,"
26150,Or sells eternity to get a toy?
26151,For one sweet grape who will the vine destroy?
26152,"Or what fond beggar, but to touch the crown,"
26153,Would with the sceptre straight be strucken down?
26154,"“If Collatinus dream of my intent,"
26155,"Will he not wake, and in a desp’rate rage"
26156,"Post hither, this vile purpose to prevent?—"
26157,"This siege that hath engirt his marriage,"
26158,"This blur to youth, this sorrow to the sage,"
26159,"This dying virtue, this surviving shame,"
26160,Whose crime will bear an ever-during blame?
26161,"“O, what excuse can my invention make"
26162,When thou shalt charge me with so black a deed?
26163,"Will not my tongue be mute, my frail joints shake,"
26164,"Mine eyes forgo their light, my false heart bleed?"
26165,"The guilt being great, the fear doth still exceed;"
26166,"And extreme fear can neither fight nor fly,"
26167,But coward-like with trembling terror die.
26168,"“Had Collatinus killed my son or sire,"
26169,"Or lain in ambush to betray my life,"
26170,"Or were he not my dear friend, this desire"
26171,"Might have excuse to work upon his wife,"
26172,As in revenge or quittal of such strife;
26173,"But as he is my kinsman, my dear friend,"
26174,The shame and fault finds no excuse nor end.
26175,"“Shameful it is; ay, if the fact be known."
26176,"Hateful it is, there is no hate in loving."
26177,I’ll beg her love. But she is not her own.
26178,The worst is but denial and reproving.
26179,"My will is strong, past reason’s weak removing."
26180,Who fears a sentence or an old man’s saw
26181,Shall by a painted cloth be kept in awe.”
26182,"Thus, graceless, holds he disputation"
26183,"’Tween frozen conscience and hot-burning will,"
26184,"And with good thoughts makes dispensation,"
26185,Urging the worser sense for vantage still;
26186,Which in a moment doth confound and kill
26187,"All pure effects, and doth so far proceed"
26188,That what is vile shows like a virtuous deed.
26189,"Quoth he, “She took me kindly by the hand,"
26190,"And gazed for tidings in my eager eyes,"
26191,Fearing some hard news from the warlike band
26192,Where her beloved Collatinus lies.
26193,O how her fear did make her colour rise!
26194,"First red as roses that on lawn we lay,"
26195,"Then white as lawn, the roses took away."
26196,"“And how her hand, in my hand being locked,"
26197,"Forced it to tremble with her loyal fear,"
26198,"Which struck her sad, and then it faster rocked,"
26199,Until her husband’s welfare she did hear;
26200,Whereat she smiled with so sweet a cheer
26201,"That had Narcissus seen her as she stood,"
26202,Self-love had never drowned him in the flood.
26203,“Why hunt I then for colour or excuses?
26204,All orators are dumb when beauty pleadeth.
26205,Poor wretches have remorse in poor abuses;
26206,Love thrives not in the heart that shadows dreadeth.
26207,"Affection is my captain, and he leadeth;"
26208,"And when his gaudy banner is displayed,"
26209,The coward fights and will not be dismayed.
26210,"“Then, childish fear, avaunt! Debating, die!"
26211,Respect and reason wait on wrinkled age!
26212,My heart shall never countermand mine eye.
26213,Sad pause and deep regard beseems the sage;
26214,"My part is youth, and beats these from the stage."
26215,"Desire my pilot is, beauty my prize;"
26216,Then who fears sinking where such treasure lies?”
26217,"As corn o’ergrown by weeds, so heedful fear"
26218,Is almost choked by unresisted lust.
26219,"Away he steals with opening, list’ning ear,"
26220,"Full of foul hope, and full of fond mistrust;"
26221,"Both which, as servitors to the unjust,"
26222,So cross him with their opposite persuasion
26223,"That now he vows a league, and now invasion."
26224,"Within his thought her heavenly image sits,"
26225,And in the self-same seat sits Collatine.
26226,That eye which looks on her confounds his wits;
26227,"That eye which him beholds, as more divine,"
26228,"Unto a view so false will not incline,"
26229,"But with a pure appeal seeks to the heart,"
26230,Which once corrupted takes the worser part;
26231,"And therein heartens up his servile powers,"
26232,"Who, flattered by their leader’s jocund show,"
26233,"Stuff up his lust, as minutes fill up hours;"
26234,"And as their captain, so their pride doth grow,"
26235,Paying more slavish tribute than they owe.
26236,"By reprobate desire thus madly led,"
26237,The Roman lord marcheth to Lucrece’ bed.
26238,"The locks between her chamber and his will,"
26239,"Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;"
26240,"But, as they open, they all rate his ill,"
26241,Which drives the creeping thief to some regard.
26242,The threshold grates the door to have him heard;
26243,Night-wand’ring weasels shriek to see him there;
26244,"They fright him, yet he still pursues his fear."
26245,"As each unwilling portal yields him way,"
26246,Through little vents and crannies of the place
26247,"The wind wars with his torch, to make him stay,"
26248,"And blows the smoke of it into his face,"
26249,Extinguishing his conduct in this case;
26250,"But his hot heart, which fond desire doth scorch,"
26251,Puffs forth another wind that fires the torch.
26252,"And being lighted, by the light he spies"
26253,"Lucretia’s glove, wherein her needle sticks;"
26254,"He takes it from the rushes where it lies,"
26255,"And griping it, the needle his finger pricks,"
26256,"As who should say, “This glove to wanton tricks"
26257,Is not inured. Return again in haste;
26258,Thou seest our mistress’ ornaments are chaste.”
26259,But all these poor forbiddings could not stay him;
26260,He in the worst sense construes their denial.
26261,"The doors, the wind, the glove that did delay him,"
26262,He takes for accidental things of trial;
26263,"Or as those bars which stop the hourly dial,"
26264,"Who with a ling’ring stay his course doth let,"
26265,Till every minute pays the hour his debt.
26266,"“So, so,” quoth he, “these lets attend the time,"
26267,"Like little frosts that sometime threat the spring,"
26268,"To add a more rejoicing to the prime,"
26269,And give the sneaped birds more cause to sing.
26270,Pain pays the income of each precious thing:
26271,"Huge rocks, high winds, strong pirates, shelves and sands"
26272,"The merchant fears, ere rich at home he lands.”"
26273,Now is he come unto the chamber door
26274,"That shuts him from the heaven of his thought,"
26275,"Which with a yielding latch, and with no more,"
26276,Hath barred him from the blessed thing he sought.
26277,"So from himself impiety hath wrought,"
26278,"That for his prey to pray he doth begin,"
26279,As if the heavens should countenance his sin.
26280,"But in the midst of his unfruitful prayer,"
26281,Having solicited th’ eternal power
26282,"That his foul thoughts might compass his fair fair,"
26283,"And they would stand auspicious to the hour,"
26284,"Even there he starts. Quoth he, “I must deflower."
26285,"The powers to whom I pray abhor this fact,"
26286,How can they then assist me in the act?
26287,"“Then Love and Fortune be my gods, my guide!"
26288,My will is backed with resolution.
26289,Thoughts are but dreams till their effects be tried;
26290,The blackest sin is cleared with absolution.
26291,Against love’s fire fear’s frost hath dissolution.
26292,"The eye of heaven is out, and misty night"
26293,Covers the shame that follows sweet delight.”
26294,"This said, his guilty hand plucked up the latch,"
26295,And with his knee the door he opens wide.
26296,The dove sleeps fast that this night-owl will catch;
26297,Thus treason works ere traitors be espied.
26298,Who sees the lurking serpent steps aside;
26299,"But she, sound sleeping, fearing no such thing,"
26300,Lies at the mercy of his mortal sting.
26301,"Into the chamber wickedly he stalks,"
26302,And gazeth on her yet unstained bed.
26303,"The curtains being close, about he walks,"
26304,Rolling his greedy eyeballs in his head.
26305,"By their high treason is his heart misled,"
26306,Which gives the watch-word to his hand full soon
26307,To draw the cloud that hides the silver moon.
26308,"Look as the fair and fiery-pointed sun,"
26309,"Rushing from forth a cloud, bereaves our sight;"
26310,"Even so, the curtain drawn, his eyes begun"
26311,"To wink, being blinded with a greater light."
26312,"Whether it is that she reflects so bright,"
26313,"That dazzleth them, or else some shame supposed;"
26314,"But blind they are, and keep themselves enclosed."
26315,"O, had they in that darksome prison died,"
26316,Then had they seen the period of their ill!
26317,Then Collatine again by Lucrece’ side
26318,In his clear bed might have reposed still.
26319,"But they must ope, this blessed league to kill;"
26320,And holy-thoughted Lucrece to their sight
26321,"Must sell her joy, her life, her world’s delight."
26322,"Her lily hand her rosy cheek lies under,"
26323,Coz’ning the pillow of a lawful kiss;
26324,"Who, therefore angry, seems to part in sunder,"
26325,Swelling on either side to want his bliss;
26326,"Between whose hills her head entombed is,"
26327,"Where like a virtuous monument she lies,"
26328,To be admired of lewd unhallowed eyes.
26329,"Without the bed her other fair hand was,"
26330,On the green coverlet; whose perfect white
26331,"Showed like an April daisy on the grass,"
26332,With pearly sweat resembling dew of night.
26333,"Her eyes, like marigolds, had sheathed their light,"
26334,"And canopied in darkness sweetly lay,"
26335,Till they might open to adorn the day.
26336,"Her hair, like golden threads, played with her breath:"
26337,"O modest wantons, wanton modesty!"
26338,"Showing life’s triumph in the map of death,"
26339,And death’s dim look in life’s mortality.
26340,"Each in her sleep themselves so beautify,"
26341,"As if between them twain there were no strife,"
26342,But that life lived in death and death in life.
26343,"Her breasts like ivory globes circled with blue,"
26344,"A pair of maiden worlds unconquered,"
26345,"Save of their lord no bearing yoke they knew,"
26346,And him by oath they truly honoured.
26347,These worlds in Tarquin new ambition bred;
26348,"Who, like a foul usurper, went about"
26349,From this fair throne to heave the owner out.
26350,What could he see but mightily he noted?
26351,What did he note but strongly he desired?
26352,"What he beheld, on that he firmly doted,"
26353,And in his will his wilful eye he tired.
26354,With more than admiration he admired
26355,"Her azure veins, her alabaster skin,"
26356,"Her coral lips, her snow-white dimpled chin."
26357,"As the grim lion fawneth o’er his prey,"
26358,"Sharp hunger by the conquest satisfied,"
26359,"So o’er this sleeping soul doth Tarquin stay,"
26360,His rage of lust by grazing qualified—
26361,"Slaked, not suppressed; for standing by her side,"
26362,"His eye, which late this mutiny restrains,"
26363,Unto a greater uproar tempts his veins.
26364,"And they, like straggling slaves for pillage fighting,"
26365,"Obdurate vassals fell exploits effecting,"
26366,"In bloody death and ravishment delighting,"
26367,"Nor children’s tears nor mothers’ groans respecting,"
26368,"Swell in their pride, the onset still expecting."
26369,"Anon his beating heart, alarum striking,"
26370,Gives the hot charge and bids them do their liking.
26371,"His drumming heart cheers up his burning eye,"
26372,His eye commends the leading to his hand;
26373,"His hand, as proud of such a dignity,"
26374,"Smoking with pride, marched on to make his stand"
26375,"On her bare breast, the heart of all her land;"
26376,"Whose ranks of blue veins, as his hand did scale,"
26377,Left their round turrets destitute and pale.
26378,"They, must’ring to the quiet cabinet"
26379,"Where their dear governess and lady lies,"
26380,"Do tell her she is dreadfully beset,"
26381,And fright her with confusion of their cries.
26382,"She, much amazed, breaks ope her locked-up eyes,"
26383,"Who, peeping forth this tumult to behold,"
26384,Are by his flaming torch dimmed and controlled.
26385,Imagine her as one in dead of night
26386,"From forth dull sleep by dreadful fancy waking,"
26387,"That thinks she hath beheld some ghastly sprite,"
26388,Whose grim aspect sets every joint a shaking.
26389,"What terror ’tis! but she, in worser taking,"
26390,"From sleep disturbed, heedfully doth view"
26391,The sight which makes supposed terror true.
26392,"Wrapped and confounded in a thousand fears,"
26393,Like to a new-killed bird she trembling lies.
26394,"She dares not look; yet, winking, there appears"
26395,"Quick-shifting antics, ugly in her eyes."
26396,Such shadows are the weak brain’s forgeries;
26397,"Who, angry that the eyes fly from their lights,"
26398,In darkness daunts them with more dreadful sights.
26399,"His hand, that yet remains upon her breast,"
26400,"Rude ram, to batter such an ivory wall!"
26401,"May feel her heart, poor citizen, distressed,"
26402,"Wounding itself to death, rise up and fall,"
26403,"Beating her bulk, that his hand shakes withal."
26404,"This moves in him more rage, and lesser pity,"
26405,To make the breach and enter this sweet city.
26406,"First, like a trumpet doth his tongue begin"
26407,"To sound a parley to his heartless foe,"
26408,"Who o’er the white sheet peers her whiter chin,"
26409,"The reason of this rash alarm to know,"
26410,Which he by dumb demeanour seeks to show;
26411,But she with vehement prayers urgeth still
26412,Under what colour he commits this ill.
26413,"Thus he replies: “The colour in thy face,"
26414,"That even for anger makes the lily pale,"
26415,"And the red rose blush at her own disgrace,"
26416,Shall plead for me and tell my loving tale.
26417,Under that colour am I come to scale
26418,"Thy never-conquered fort; the fault is thine,"
26419,For those thine eyes betray thee unto mine.
26420,"“Thus I forestall thee, if thou mean to chide:"
26421,"Thy beauty hath ensnared thee to this night,"
26422,"Where thou with patience must my will abide,"
26423,"My will that marks thee for my earth’s delight,"
26424,Which I to conquer sought with all my might.
26425,"But as reproof and reason beat it dead,"
26426,By thy bright beauty was it newly bred.
26427,“I see what crosses my attempt will bring;
26428,I know what thorns the growing rose defends;
26429,I think the honey guarded with a sting;
26430,All this beforehand counsel comprehends.
26431,"But will is deaf, and hears no heedful friends;"
26432,"Only he hath an eye to gaze on beauty,"
26433,"And dotes on what he looks, ’gainst law or duty."
26434,"“I have debated, even in my soul,"
26435,"What wrong, what shame, what sorrow I shall breed;"
26436,"But nothing can affection’s course control,"
26437,Or stop the headlong fury of his speed.
26438,"I know repentant tears ensue the deed,"
26439,"Reproach, disdain, and deadly enmity;"
26440,Yet strike I to embrace mine infamy.”
26441,"This said, he shakes aloft his Roman blade,"
26442,"Which, like a falcon tow’ring in the skies,"
26443,"Coucheth the fowl below with his wings’ shade,"
26444,"Whose crooked beak threats, if he mount he dies."
26445,So under his insulting falchion lies
26446,"Harmless Lucretia, marking what he tells"
26447,"With trembling fear, as fowl hear falcon’s bells."
26448,"“Lucrece,” quoth he, “this night I must enjoy thee."
26449,"If thou deny, then force must work my way,"
26450,For in thy bed I purpose to destroy thee;
26451,"That done, some worthless slave of thine I’ll slay."
26452,To kill thine honour with thy life’s decay;
26453,"And in thy dead arms do I mean to place him,"
26454,"Swearing I slew him, seeing thee embrace him."
26455,“So thy surviving husband shall remain
26456,The scornful mark of every open eye;
26457,"Thy kinsmen hang their heads at this disdain,"
26458,Thy issue blurred with nameless bastardy.
26459,"And thou, the author of their obloquy,"
26460,Shalt have thy trespass cited up in rhymes
26461,And sung by children in succeeding times.
26462,"“But if thou yield, I rest thy secret friend."
26463,The fault unknown is as a thought unacted;
26464,A little harm done to a great good end
26465,For lawful policy remains enacted.
26466,The poisonous simple sometimes is compacted
26467,"In a pure compound; being so applied,"
26468,His venom in effect is purified.
26469,"“Then, for thy husband and thy children’s sake,"
26470,Tender my suit. Bequeath not to their lot
26471,"The shame that from them no device can take,"
26472,"The blemish that will never be forgot,"
26473,"Worse than a slavish wipe, or birth-hour’s blot:"
26474,For marks descried in men’s nativity
26475,"Are nature’s faults, not their own infamy.”"
26476,Here with a cockatrice’ dead-killing eye
26477,He rouseth up himself and makes a pause;
26478,"While she, the picture of pure piety,"
26479,"Like a white hind under the gripe’s sharp claws,"
26480,"Pleads in a wilderness where are no laws,"
26481,"To the rough beast that knows no gentle right,"
26482,Nor aught obeys but his foul appetite.
26483,"But when a black-faced cloud the world doth threat,"
26484,"In his dim mist th’ aspiring mountains hiding,"
26485,"From earth’s dark womb some gentle gust doth get,"
26486,"Which blows these pitchy vapours from their biding,"
26487,Hind’ring their present fall by this dividing;
26488,"So his unhallowed haste her words delays,"
26489,And moody Pluto winks while Orpheus plays.
26490,"Yet, foul night-waking cat, he doth but dally,"
26491,While in his hold-fast foot the weak mouse panteth.
26492,"Her sad behaviour feeds his vulture folly,"
26493,A swallowing gulf that even in plenty wanteth.
26494,"His ear her prayers admits, but his heart granteth"
26495,No penetrable entrance to her plaining;
26496,"Tears harden lust, though marble wear with raining."
26497,Her pity-pleading eyes are sadly fixed
26498,In the remorseless wrinkles of his face.
26499,"Her modest eloquence with sighs is mixed,"
26500,Which to her oratory adds more grace.
26501,"She puts the period often from his place,"
26502,And midst the sentence so her accent breaks
26503,That twice she doth begin ere once she speaks.
26504,"She conjures him by high almighty Jove,"
26505,"By knighthood, gentry, and sweet friendship’s oath,"
26506,"By her untimely tears, her husband’s love,"
26507,"By holy human law, and common troth,"
26508,"By heaven and earth, and all the power of both,"
26509,"That to his borrowed bed he make retire,"
26510,"And stoop to honour, not to foul desire."
26511,"Quoth she, “Reward not hospitality"
26512,With such black payment as thou hast pretended;
26513,"Mud not the fountain that gave drink to thee,"
26514,Mar not the thing that cannot be amended.
26515,End thy ill aim before the shoot be ended;
26516,He is no woodman that doth bend his bow
26517,To strike a poor unseasonable doe.
26518,“My husband is thy friend; for his sake spare me.
26519,Thyself art mighty; for thine own sake leave me.
26520,"Myself a weakling, do not then ensnare me;"
26521,Thou look’st not like deceit; do not deceive me.
26522,"My sighs, like whirlwinds, labour hence to heave thee."
26523,"If ever man were moved with woman’s moans,"
26524,"Be moved with my tears, my sighs, my groans."
26525,"“All which together, like a troubled ocean,"
26526,"Beat at thy rocky and wrack-threat’ning heart,"
26527,To soften it with their continual motion;
26528,For stones dissolved to water do convert.
26529,"O, if no harder than a stone thou art,"
26530,Melt at my tears and be compassionate!
26531,Soft pity enters at an iron gate.
26532,“In Tarquin’s likeness I did entertain thee.
26533,Hast thou put on his shape to do him shame?
26534,"To all the host of heaven I complain me,"
26535,"Thou wrong’st his honour, wound’st his princely name."
26536,"Thou art not what thou seem’st; and if the same,"
26537,"Thou seem’st not what thou art, a god, a king;"
26538,For kings like gods should govern everything.
26539,"“How will thy shame be seeded in thine age,"
26540,When thus thy vices bud before thy spring?
26541,"If in thy hope thou dar’st do such outrage,"
26542,What dar’st thou not when once thou art a king?
26543,"O, be remembered, no outrageous thing"
26544,From vassal actors can be wiped away;
26545,Then kings’ misdeeds cannot be hid in clay.
26546,"“This deed will make thee only loved for fear,"
26547,But happy monarchs still are feared for love.
26548,"With foul offenders thou perforce must bear,"
26549,When they in thee the like offences prove.
26550,"If but for fear of this, thy will remove,"
26551,"For princes are the glass, the school, the book,"
26552,"Where subjects’ eyes do learn, do read, do look."
26553,“And wilt thou be the school where Lust shall learn?
26554,Must he in thee read lectures of such shame?
26555,"Wilt thou be glass, wherein it shall discern"
26556,"Authority for sin, warrant for blame,"
26557,To privilege dishonour in thy name?
26558,"Thou back’st reproach against long-living laud,"
26559,And mak’st fair reputation but a bawd.
26560,"“Hast thou command? By him that gave it thee,"
26561,From a pure heart command thy rebel will.
26562,"Draw not thy sword to guard iniquity,"
26563,For it was lent thee all that brood to kill.
26564,"Thy princely office how canst thou fulfill,"
26565,"When, patterned by thy fault, foul Sin may say"
26566,"He learned to sin, and thou didst teach the way?"
26567,“Think but how vile a spectacle it were
26568,To view thy present trespass in another.
26569,Men’s faults do seldom to themselves appear;
26570,Their own transgressions partially they smother.
26571,This guilt would seem death-worthy in thy brother.
26572,O how are they wrapped in with infamies
26573,That from their own misdeeds askance their eyes!
26574,"“To thee, to thee, my heaved-up hands appeal,"
26575,"Not to seducing lust, thy rash relier."
26576,I sue for exiled majesty’s repeal;
26577,"Let him return, and flatt’ring thoughts retire."
26578,"His true respect will prison false desire,"
26579,"And wipe the dim mist from thy doting eyne,"
26580,"That thou shalt see thy state, and pity mine.”"
26581,"“Have done,” quoth he. “My uncontrolled tide"
26582,"Turns not, but swells the higher by this let."
26583,"Small lights are soon blown out, huge fires abide,"
26584,And with the wind in greater fury fret.
26585,The petty streams that pay a daily debt
26586,"To their salt sovereign, with their fresh falls’ haste"
26587,"Add to his flow, but alter not his taste.”"
26588,"“Thou art,” quoth she, “a sea, a sovereign king,"
26589,"And, lo, there falls into thy boundless flood"
26590,"Black lust, dishonour, shame, misgoverning,"
26591,Who seek to stain the ocean of thy blood.
26592,"If all these petty ills shall change thy good,"
26593,"Thy sea within a puddle’s womb is hearsed,"
26594,And not the puddle in thy sea dispersed.
26595,"“So shall these slaves be king, and thou their slave;"
26596,"Thou nobly base, they basely dignified;"
26597,"Thou their fair life, and they thy fouler grave;"
26598,"Thou loathed in their shame, they in thy pride."
26599,The lesser thing should not the greater hide;
26600,"The cedar stoops not to the base shrub’s foot,"
26601,But low shrubs wither at the cedar’s root.
26602,"“So let thy thoughts, low vassals to thy state”—"
26603,"“No more,” quoth he, “by heaven, I will not hear thee."
26604,"Yield to my love. If not, enforced hate,"
26605,"Instead of love’s coy touch, shall rudely tear thee."
26606,"That done, despitefully I mean to bear thee"
26607,"Unto the base bed of some rascal groom,"
26608,To be thy partner in this shameful doom.”
26609,"This said, he sets his foot upon the light,"
26610,For light and lust are deadly enemies.
26611,"Shame folded up in blind concealing night,"
26612,"When most unseen, then most doth tyrannize."
26613,"The wolf hath seized his prey, the poor lamb cries,"
26614,Till with her own white fleece her voice controlled
26615,Entombs her outcry in her lips’ sweet fold.
26616,For with the nightly linen that she wears
26617,"He pens her piteous clamours in her head,"
26618,Cooling his hot face in the chastest tears
26619,That ever modest eyes with sorrow shed.
26620,"O, that prone lust should stain so pure a bed!"
26621,"The spots whereof could weeping purify,"
26622,Her tears should drop on them perpetually.
26623,"But she hath lost a dearer thing than life,"
26624,And he hath won what he would lose again.
26625,This forced league doth force a further strife;
26626,This momentary joy breeds months of pain;
26627,This hot desire converts to cold disdain.
26628,"Pure Chastity is rifled of her store,"
26629,"And Lust, the thief, far poorer than before."
26630,"Look as the full-fed hound or gorged hawk,"
26631,"Unapt for tender smell or speedy flight,"
26632,"Make slow pursuit, or altogether balk"
26633,The prey wherein by nature they delight;
26634,So surfeit-taking Tarquin fares this night.
26635,"His taste delicious, in digestion souring,"
26636,"Devours his will, that lived by foul devouring."
26637,O deeper sin than bottomless conceit
26638,Can comprehend in still imagination!
26639,"Drunken desire must vomit his receipt,"
26640,Ere he can see his own abomination.
26641,While lust is in his pride no exclamation
26642,"Can curb his heat or rein his rash desire,"
26643,"Till, like a jade, self-will himself doth tire."
26644,"And then with lank and lean discoloured cheek,"
26645,"With heavy eye, knit brow, and strengthless pace,"
26646,"Feeble desire, all recreant, poor, and meek,"
26647,Like to a bankrout beggar wails his case.
26648,"The flesh being proud, desire doth fight with Grace,"
26649,"For there it revels; and when that decays,"
26650,The guilty rebel for remission prays.
26651,"So fares it with this faultful lord of Rome,"
26652,Who this accomplishment so hotly chased;
26653,"For now against himself he sounds this doom,"
26654,That through the length of times he stands disgraced.
26655,"Besides, his soul’s fair temple is defaced,"
26656,"To whose weak ruins muster troops of cares,"
26657,To ask the spotted princess how she fares.
26658,She says her subjects with foul insurrection
26659,"Have battered down her consecrated wall,"
26660,And by their mortal fault brought in subjection
26661,"Her immortality, and made her thrall"
26662,"To living death and pain perpetual,"
26663,"Which in her prescience she controlled still,"
26664,But her foresight could not forestall their will.
26665,"E’en in this thought through the dark night he stealeth,"
26666,"A captive victor that hath lost in gain,"
26667,"Bearing away the wound that nothing healeth,"
26668,"The scar that will, despite of cure, remain;"
26669,Leaving his spoil perplexed in greater pain.
26670,"She bears the load of lust he left behind,"
26671,And he the burden of a guilty mind.
26672,He like a thievish dog creeps sadly thence;
26673,She like a wearied lamb lies panting there;
26674,"He scowls, and hates himself for his offence;"
26675,"She, desperate, with her nails her flesh doth tear."
26676,"He faintly flies, sweating with guilty fear;"
26677,"She stays, exclaiming on the direful night;"
26678,"He runs, and chides his vanished, loathed delight."
26679,He thence departs a heavy convertite;
26680,She there remains a hopeless castaway.
26681,He in his speed looks for the morning light;
26682,She prays she never may behold the day.
26683,"“For day,” quoth she, “night’s scapes doth open lay,"
26684,And my true eyes have never practised how
26685,To cloak offences with a cunning brow.
26686,“They think not but that every eye can see
26687,The same disgrace which they themselves behold;
26688,"And therefore would they still in darkness be,"
26689,To have their unseen sin remain untold.
26690,"For they their guilt with weeping will unfold,"
26691,"And grave, like water that doth eat in steel,"
26692,Upon my cheeks what helpless shame I feel.”
26693,"Here she exclaims against repose and rest,"
26694,And bids her eyes hereafter still be blind.
26695,"She wakes her heart by beating on her breast,"
26696,"And bids it leap from thence, where it may find"
26697,"Some purer chest, to close so pure a mind."
26698,Frantic with grief thus breathes she forth her spite
26699,Against the unseen secrecy of night.
26700,"“O comfort-killing night, image of hell,"
26701,"Dim register and notary of shame,"
26702,"Black stage for tragedies and murders fell,"
26703,"Vast sin-concealing chaos, nurse of blame,"
26704,"Blind muffled bawd, dark harbour for defame,"
26705,"Grim cave of death, whisp’ring conspirator"
26706,With close-tongued treason and the ravisher!
26707,"“O hateful, vaporous, and foggy night,"
26708,"Since thou art guilty of my cureless crime,"
26709,"Muster thy mists to meet the eastern light,"
26710,Make war against proportioned course of time;
26711,Or if thou wilt permit the sun to climb
26712,"His wonted height, yet ere he go to bed,"
26713,Knit poisonous clouds about his golden head.
26714,“With rotten damps ravish the morning air;
26715,Let their exhaled unwholesome breaths make sick
26716,"The life of purity, the supreme fair,"
26717,Ere he arrive his weary noontide prick.
26718,"And let thy misty vapours march so thick,"
26719,That in their smoky ranks his smothered light
26720,May set at noon and make perpetual night.
26721,"“Were Tarquin night, as he is but night’s child,"
26722,The silver-shining queen he would distain;
26723,"Her twinkling handmaids too, by him defiled,"
26724,Through Night’s black bosom should not peep again.
26725,So should I have co-partners in my pain;
26726,"And fellowship in woe doth woe assuage,"
26727,As palmers’ chat makes short their pilgrimage.
26728,"“Where now I have no one to blush with me,"
26729,"To cross their arms and hang their heads with mine,"
26730,"To mask their brows, and hide their infamy;"
26731,"But I alone alone must sit and pine,"
26732,"Seasoning the earth with showers of silver brine,"
26733,"Mingling my talk with tears, my grief with groans,"
26734,Poor wasting monuments of lasting moans.
26735,"“O night, thou furnace of foul reeking smoke,"
26736,Let not the jealous day behold that face
26737,Which underneath thy black all-hiding cloak
26738,Immodesty lies martyred with disgrace!
26739,"Keep still possession of thy gloomy place,"
26740,That all the faults which in thy reign are made
26741,May likewise be sepulchred in thy shade.
26742,“Make me not object to the tell-tale day.
26743,The light will show charactered in my brow
26744,"The story of sweet chastity’s decay,"
26745,The impious breach of holy wedlock vow.
26746,"Yea, the illiterate, that know not how"
26747,"To cipher what is writ in learned books,"
26748,Will quote my loathsome trespass in my looks.
26749,"“The nurse, to still her child, will tell my story"
26750,And fright her crying babe with Tarquin’s name.
26751,"The orator, to deck his oratory,"
26752,Will couple my reproach to Tarquin’s shame.
26753,"Feast-finding minstrels, tuning my defame,"
26754,"Will tie the hearers to attend each line,"
26755,"How Tarquin wronged me, I Collatine."
26756,"“Let my good name, that senseless reputation,"
26757,For Collatine’s dear love be kept unspotted.
26758,"If that be made a theme for disputation,"
26759,"The branches of another root are rotted,"
26760,And undeserved reproach to him allotted
26761,That is as clear from this attaint of mine
26762,"As I, ere this, was pure to Collatine."
26763,"“O unseen shame, invisible disgrace!"
26764,"O unfelt sore, crest-wounding, private scar!"
26765,"Reproach is stamped in Collatinus’ face,"
26766,"And Tarquin’s eye may read the mot afar,"
26767,"How he in peace is wounded, not in war."
26768,"Alas, how many bear such shameful blows,"
26769,"Which not themselves, but he that gives them knows!"
26770,"“If, Collatine, thine honour lay in me,"
26771,From me by strong assault it is bereft.
26772,"My honey lost, and I, a drone-like bee,"
26773,"Have no perfection of my summer left,"
26774,But robbed and ransacked by injurious theft.
26775,"In thy weak hive a wand’ring wasp hath crept,"
26776,And sucked the honey which thy chaste bee kept.
26777,“Yet am I guilty of thy honour’s wrack;
26778,Yet for thy honour did I entertain him.
26779,"Coming from thee, I could not put him back,"
26780,For it had been dishonour to disdain him.
26781,"Besides, of weariness he did complain him,"
26782,"And talked of virtue. O unlooked-for evil,"
26783,When virtue is profaned in such a devil!
26784,“Why should the worm intrude the maiden bud?
26785,Or hateful cuckoos hatch in sparrows’ nests?
26786,Or toads infect fair founts with venom mud?
26787,Or tyrant folly lurk in gentle breasts?
26788,Or kings be breakers of their own behests?
26789,But no perfection is so absolute
26790,That some impurity doth not pollute.
26791,“The aged man that coffers up his gold
26792,"Is plagued with cramps, and gouts and painful fits,"
26793,"And scarce hath eyes his treasure to behold,"
26794,"But like still-pining Tantalus he sits,"
26795,"And useless barns the harvest of his wits,"
26796,Having no other pleasure of his gain
26797,But torment that it cannot cure his pain.
26798,"“So then he hath it when he cannot use it,"
26799,"And leaves it to be mastered by his young,"
26800,Who in their pride do presently abuse it.
26801,"Their father was too weak, and they too strong,"
26802,To hold their cursed-blessed fortune long.
26803,The sweets we wish for turn to loathed sours
26804,Even in the moment that we call them ours.
26805,“Unruly blasts wait on the tender spring;
26806,Unwholesome weeds take root with precious flowers;
26807,The adder hisses where the sweet birds sing;
26808,What virtue breeds iniquity devours.
26809,"We have no good that we can say is ours,"
26810,Or kills his life or else his quality.
26811,"“O Opportunity, thy guilt is great!"
26812,’Tis thou that execut’st the traitor’s treason;
26813,Thou sets the wolf where he the lamb may get;
26814,"Whoever plots the sin, thou ’point’st the season."
26815,"’Tis thou that spurn’st at right, at law, at reason;"
26816,"And in thy shady cell, where none may spy him,"
26817,"Sits Sin, to seize the souls that wander by him."
26818,“Thou mak’st the vestal violate her oath;
26819,Thou blow’st the fire when temperance is thawed;
26820,"Thou smother’st honesty, thou murder’st troth,"
26821,"Thou foul abettor, thou notorious bawd!"
26822,Thou plantest scandal and displacest laud.
26823,"Thou ravisher, thou traitor, thou false thief,"
26824,"Thy honey turns to gall, thy joy to grief."
26825,"“Thy secret pleasure turns to open shame,"
26826,"Thy private feasting to a public fast,"
26827,"Thy smoothing titles to a ragged name,"
26828,Thy sugared tongue to bitter wormwood taste.
26829,Thy violent vanities can never last.
26830,"How comes it then, vile Opportunity,"
26831,"Being so bad, such numbers seek for thee?"
26832,"“When wilt thou be the humble suppliant’s friend,"
26833,And bring him where his suit may be obtained?
26834,"When wilt thou sort an hour great strifes to end,"
26835,Or free that soul which wretchedness hath chained?
26836,"Give physic to the sick, ease to the pained?"
26837,"The poor, lame, blind, halt, creep, cry out for thee;"
26838,But they ne’er meet with Opportunity.
26839,“The patient dies while the physician sleeps;
26840,The orphan pines while the oppressor feeds;
26841,Justice is feasting while the widow weeps;
26842,Advice is sporting while infection breeds.
26843,Thou grant’st no time for charitable deeds.
26844,"Wrath, envy, treason, rape, and murder’s rages,"
26845,Thy heinous hours wait on them as their pages.
26846,"“When truth and virtue have to do with thee,"
26847,A thousand crosses keep them from thy aid;
26848,They buy thy help; but Sin ne’er gives a fee;
26849,"He gratis comes, and thou art well appaid"
26850,As well to hear as grant what he hath said.
26851,My Collatine would else have come to me
26852,"When Tarquin did, but he was stayed by thee."
26853,"“Guilty thou art of murder and of theft,"
26854,"Guilty of perjury and subornation,"
26855,"Guilty of treason, forgery, and shift,"
26856,"Guilty of incest, that abomination:"
26857,An accessory by thine inclination
26858,"To all sins past and all that are to come,"
26859,From the creation to the general doom.
26860,"“Misshapen Time, copesmate of ugly night,"
26861,"Swift subtle post, carrier of grisly care,"
26862,"Eater of youth, false slave to false delight,"
26863,"Base watch of woes, sin’s pack-horse, virtue’s snare!"
26864,Thou nursest all and murd’rest all that are.
26865,"O hear me then, injurious, shifting Time!"
26866,"Be guilty of my death, since of my crime."
26867,"“Why hath thy servant, Opportunity"
26868,"Betrayed the hours thou gav’st me to repose,"
26869,"Cancelled my fortunes, and enchained me"
26870,To endless date of never-ending woes?
26871,"Time’s office is to fine the hate of foes,"
26872,"To eat up errors by opinion bred,"
26873,Not spend the dowry of a lawful bed.
26874,"“Time’s glory is to calm contending kings,"
26875,"To unmask falsehood and bring truth to light,"
26876,"To stamp the seal of time in aged things,"
26877,"To wake the morn and sentinel the night,"
26878,"To wrong the wronger till he render right,"
26879,"To ruinate proud buildings with thy hours,"
26880,And smear with dust their glitt’ring golden towers;
26881,"“To fill with worm-holes stately monuments,"
26882,"To feed oblivion with decay of things,"
26883,"To blot old books and alter their contents,"
26884,"To pluck the quills from ancient ravens’ wings,"
26885,"To dry the old oak’s sap and cherish springs,"
26886,"To spoil antiquities of hammered steel,"
26887,And turn the giddy round of Fortune’s wheel;
26888,"“To show the beldam daughters of her daughter,"
26889,"To make the child a man, the man a child,"
26890,"To slay the tiger that doth live by slaughter,"
26891,"To tame the unicorn and lion wild,"
26892,"To mock the subtle in themselves beguiled,"
26893,"To cheer the ploughman with increaseful crops,"
26894,And waste huge stones with little water-drops.
26895,"“Why work’st thou mischief in thy pilgrimage,"
26896,Unless thou couldst return to make amends?
26897,One poor retiring minute in an age
26898,"Would purchase thee a thousand thousand friends,"
26899,Lending him wit that to bad debtors lends.
26900,"O, this dread night, wouldst thou one hour come back,"
26901,I could prevent this storm and shun thy wrack!
26902,"“Thou ceaseless lackey to eternity,"
26903,With some mischance cross Tarquin in his flight.
26904,"Devise extremes beyond extremity,"
26905,To make him curse this cursed crimeful night.
26906,"Let ghastly shadows his lewd eyes affright,"
26907,And the dire thought of his committed evil
26908,Shape every bush a hideous shapeless devil.
26909,"“Disturb his hours of rest with restless trances,"
26910,Afflict him in his bed with bedrid groans;
26911,"Let there bechance him pitiful mischances,"
26912,"To make him moan, but pity not his moans."
26913,"Stone him with hard’ned hearts harder than stones,"
26914,"And let mild women to him lose their mildness,"
26915,Wilder to him than tigers in their wildness.
26916,"“Let him have time to tear his curled hair,"
26917,"Let him have time against himself to rave,"
26918,"Let him have time of Time’s help to despair,"
26919,"Let him have time to live a loathed slave,"
26920,"Let him have time a beggar’s orts to crave,"
26921,And time to see one that by alms doth live
26922,Disdain to him disdained scraps to give.
26923,"“Let him have time to see his friends his foes,"
26924,And merry fools to mock at him resort;
26925,Let him have time to mark how slow time goes
26926,"In time of sorrow, and how swift and short"
26927,His time of folly and his time of sport;
26928,And ever let his unrecalling crime
26929,Have time to wail th’ abusing of his time.
26930,"“O Time, thou tutor both to good and bad,"
26931,Teach me to curse him that thou taught’st this ill!
26932,"At his own shadow let the thief run mad,"
26933,Himself himself seek every hour to kill.
26934,"Such wretched hands such wretched blood should spill,"
26935,For who so base would such an office have
26936,As sland’rous deathsman to so base a slave?
26937,"“The baser is he, coming from a king,"
26938,To shame his hope with deeds degenerate.
26939,"The mightier man, the mightier is the thing"
26940,That makes him honoured or begets him hate;
26941,For greatest scandal waits on greatest state.
26942,"The moon being clouded presently is missed,"
26943,But little stars may hide them when they list.
26944,"“The crow may bathe his coal-black wings in mire,"
26945,And unperceived fly with the filth away;
26946,"But if the like the snow-white swan desire,"
26947,The stain upon his silver down will stay.
26948,"Poor grooms are sightless night, kings glorious day."
26949,"Gnats are unnoted wheresoe’er they fly,"
26950,But eagles gazed upon with every eye.
26951,"“Out, idle words, servants to shallow fools,"
26952,"Unprofitable sounds, weak arbitrators!"
26953,Busy yourselves in skill-contending schools;
26954,Debate where leisure serves with dull debaters;
26955,To trembling clients be you mediators.
26956,"For me, I force not argument a straw,"
26957,Since that my case is past the help of law.
26958,"“In vain I rail at Opportunity,"
26959,"At Time, at Tarquin, and uncheerful night;"
26960,"In vain I cavil with mine infamy,"
26961,In vain I spurn at my confirmed despite.
26962,This helpless smoke of words doth me no right.
26963,The remedy indeed to do me good
26964,Is to let forth my foul defiled blood.
26965,"“Poor hand, why quiver’st thou at this decree?"
26966,"Honour thyself to rid me of this shame,"
26967,"For if I die, my honour lives in thee,"
26968,"But if I live, thou liv’st in my defame."
26969,"Since thou couldst not defend thy loyal dame,"
26970,"And wast afeared to scratch her wicked foe,"
26971,Kill both thyself and her for yielding so.”
26972,"This said, from her betumbled couch she starteth,"
26973,To find some desp’rate instrument of death;
26974,But this no slaughterhouse no tool imparteth
26975,"To make more vent for passage of her breath,"
26976,"Which, thronging through her lips, so vanisheth"
26977,"As smoke from Ætna, that in air consumes,"
26978,Or that which from discharged cannon fumes.
26979,"“In vain,” quoth she, “I live, and seek in vain"
26980,Some happy mean to end a hapless life.
26981,"I feared by Tarquin’s falchion to be slain,"
26982,Yet for the self-same purpose seek a knife.
26983,But when I feared I was a loyal wife;
26984,"So am I now.—O no, that cannot be!"
26985,Of that true type hath Tarquin rifled me.
26986,"“O that is gone for which I sought to live,"
26987,And therefore now I need not fear to die.
26988,"To clear this spot by death, at least I give"
26989,"A badge of fame to slander’s livery,"
26990,A dying life to living infamy.
26991,"Poor helpless help, the treasure stol’n away,"
26992,To burn the guiltless casket where it lay!
26993,"“Well, well, dear Collatine, thou shalt not know"
26994,The stained taste of violated troth;
26995,"I will not wrong thy true affection so,"
26996,To flatter thee with an infringed oath.
26997,This bastard graff shall never come to growth;
26998,He shall not boast who did thy stock pollute
26999,That thou art doting father of his fruit.
27000,"“Nor shall he smile at thee in secret thought,"
27001,Nor laugh with his companions at thy state;
27002,But thou shalt know thy int’rest was not bought
27003,"Basely with gold, but stol’n from forth thy gate."
27004,"For me, I am the mistress of my fate,"
27005,"And with my trespass never will dispense,"
27006,Till life to death acquit my forced offence.
27007,"“I will not poison thee with my attaint,"
27008,Nor fold my fault in cleanly-coined excuses;
27009,"My sable ground of sin I will not paint,"
27010,To hide the truth of this false night’s abuses.
27011,"My tongue shall utter all; mine eyes, like sluices,"
27012,"As from a mountain-spring that feeds a dale,"
27013,Shall gush pure streams to purge my impure tale.”
27014,"By this, lamenting Philomel had ended"
27015,"The well-tuned warble of her nightly sorrow,"
27016,And solemn night with slow sad gait descended
27017,"To ugly hell; when, lo, the blushing morrow"
27018,Lends light to all fair eyes that light will borrow.
27019,"But cloudy Lucrece shames herself to see,"
27020,And therefore still in night would cloistered be.
27021,"Revealing day through every cranny spies,"
27022,"And seems to point her out where she sits weeping,"
27023,"To whom she sobbing speaks: “O eye of eyes,"
27024,"Why pry’st thou through my window? Leave thy peeping,"
27025,Mock with thy tickling beams eyes that are sleeping.
27026,"Brand not my forehead with thy piercing light,"
27027,For day hath naught to do what’s done by night.”
27028,Thus cavils she with everything she sees.
27029,"True grief is fond and testy as a child,"
27030,"Who wayward once, his mood with naught agrees."
27031,"Old woes, not infant sorrows, bear them mild."
27032,"Continuance tames the one; the other wild,"
27033,Like an unpractised swimmer plunging still
27034,With too much labour drowns for want of skill.
27035,"So she, deep-drenched in a sea of care,"
27036,"Holds disputation with each thing she views,"
27037,And to herself all sorrow doth compare;
27038,"No object but her passion’s strength renews,"
27039,"And as one shifts, another straight ensues."
27040,Sometime her grief is dumb and hath no words;
27041,Sometime ’tis mad and too much talk affords.
27042,The little birds that tune their morning’s joy
27043,Make her moans mad with their sweet melody.
27044,For mirth doth search the bottom of annoy;
27045,Sad souls are slain in merry company.
27046,Grief best is pleased with grief’s society;
27047,True sorrow then is feelingly sufficed
27048,When with like semblance it is sympathized.
27049,’Tis double death to drown in ken of shore;
27050,He ten times pines that pines beholding food;
27051,To see the salve doth make the wound ache more;
27052,Great grief grieves most at that would do it good;
27053,"Deep woes roll forward like a gentle flood,"
27054,"Who, being stopped, the bounding banks o’erflows;"
27055,Grief dallied with nor law nor limit knows.
27056,"“You mocking birds,” quoth she, “your tunes entomb"
27057,"Within your hollow-swelling feathered breasts,"
27058,And in my hearing be you mute and dumb;
27059,My restless discord loves no stops nor rests.
27060,A woeful hostess brooks not merry guests.
27061,Relish your nimble notes to pleasing ears;
27062,Distress likes dumps when time is kept with tears.
27063,"“Come, Philomel, that sing’st of ravishment,"
27064,Make thy sad grove in my disheveled hair.
27065,"As the dank earth weeps at thy languishment,"
27066,So I at each sad strain will strain a tear
27067,And with deep groans the diapason bear;
27068,"For burden-wise I’ll hum on Tarquin still,"
27069,While thou on Tereus descants better skill.
27070,“And whiles against a thorn thou bear’st thy part
27071,"To keep thy sharp woes waking, wretched I,"
27072,"To imitate thee well, against my heart"
27073,"Will fix a sharp knife to affright mine eye,"
27074,Who if it wink shall thereon fall and die.
27075,"These means, as frets upon an instrument,"
27076,Shall tune our heart-strings to true languishment.
27077,"“And for, poor bird, thou sing’st not in the day,"
27078,"As shaming any eye should thee behold,"
27079,"Some dark deep desert seated from the way,"
27080,"That knows not parching heat nor freezing cold,"
27081,Will we find out; and there we will unfold
27082,To creatures stern sad tunes to change their kinds.
27083,"Since men prove beasts, let beasts bear gentle minds.”"
27084,"As the poor frighted deer that stands at gaze,"
27085,"Wildly determining which way to fly,"
27086,"Or one encompassed with a winding maze,"
27087,That cannot tread the way out readily;
27088,"So with herself is she in mutiny,"
27089,"To live or die which of the twain were better,"
27090,When life is shamed and Death reproach’s debtor.
27091,"“To kill myself,” quoth she, “alack, what were it,"
27092,But with my body my poor soul’s pollution?
27093,They that lose half with greater patience bear it
27094,Than they whose whole is swallowed in confusion.
27095,That mother tries a merciless conclusion
27096,"Who, having two sweet babes, when death takes one,"
27097,"Will slay the other, and be nurse to none."
27098,"“My body or my soul, which was the dearer,"
27099,"When the one pure, the other made divine?"
27100,"Whose love of either to myself was nearer,"
27101,When both were kept for heaven and Collatine?
27102,"Ay me, the bark pilled from the lofty pine,"
27103,His leaves will wither and his sap decay;
27104,"So must my soul, her bark being pilled away."
27105,"“Her house is sacked, her quiet interrupted,"
27106,"Her mansion battered by the enemy,"
27107,"Her sacred temple spotted, spoiled, corrupted,"
27108,Grossly engirt with daring infamy.
27109,"Then let it not be called impiety,"
27110,If in this blemished fort I make some hole
27111,Through which I may convey this troubled soul.
27112,“Yet die I will not till my Collatine
27113,"Have heard the cause of my untimely death,"
27114,"That he may vow, in that sad hour of mine,"
27115,Revenge on him that made me stop my breath.
27116,"My stained blood to Tarquin I’ll bequeath,"
27117,"Which by him tainted shall for him be spent,"
27118,And as his due writ in my testament.
27119,“My honour I’ll bequeath unto the knife
27120,That wounds my body so dishonoured.
27121,’Tis honour to deprive dishonoured life;
27122,"The one will live, the other being dead."
27123,"So of shame’s ashes shall my fame be bred,"
27124,For in my death I murder shameful scorn;
27125,"My shame so dead, mine honour is new born."
27126,"“Dear lord of that dear jewel I have lost,"
27127,What legacy shall I bequeath to thee?
27128,"My resolution, love, shall be thy boast,"
27129,By whose example thou revenged mayst be.
27130,"How Tarquin must be used, read it in me;"
27131,"Myself, thy friend, will kill myself, thy foe,"
27132,And for my sake serve thou false Tarquin so.
27133,“This brief abridgement of my will I make:
27134,My soul and body to the skies and ground;
27135,"My resolution, husband, do thou take;"
27136,Mine honour be the knife’s that makes my wound;
27137,My shame be his that did my fame confound;
27138,And all my fame that lives disbursed be
27139,To those that live and think no shame of me.
27140,"“Thou, Collatine, shalt oversee this will;"
27141,How was I overseen that thou shalt see it!
27142,My blood shall wash the slander of mine ill;
27143,My life’s foul deed my life’s fair end shall free it.
27144,"Faint not, faint heart, but stoutly say, ‘So be it.’"
27145,Yield to my hand; my hand shall conquer thee.
27146,"Thou dead, both die, and both shall victors be.”"
27147,"This plot of death when sadly she had laid,"
27148,"And wiped the brinish pearl from her bright eyes,"
27149,"With untuned tongue she hoarsely called her maid,"
27150,Whose swift obedience to her mistress hies;
27151,For fleet-winged duty with thought’s feathers flies.
27152,Poor Lucrece’ cheeks unto her maid seem so
27153,As winter meads when sun doth melt their snow.
27154,"Her mistress she doth give demure good-morrow,"
27155,"With soft slow tongue, true mark of modesty,"
27156,"And sorts a sad look to her lady’s sorrow,"
27157,"For why her face wore sorrow’s livery,"
27158,But durst not ask of her audaciously
27159,"Why her two suns were cloud-eclipsed so,"
27160,Nor why her fair cheeks over-washed with woe.
27161,"But as the earth doth weep, the sun being set,"
27162,"Each flower moistened like a melting eye,"
27163,Even so the maid with swelling drops ’gan wet
27164,"Her circled eyne, enforced by sympathy"
27165,"Of those fair suns set in her mistress’ sky,"
27166,"Who in a salt-waved ocean quench their light,"
27167,Which makes the maid weep like the dewy night.
27168,"A pretty while these pretty creatures stand,"
27169,Like ivory conduits coral cisterns filling.
27170,One justly weeps; the other takes in hand
27171,"No cause, but company, of her drops spilling."
27172,"Their gentle sex to weep are often willing,"
27173,"Grieving themselves to guess at others’ smarts,"
27174,And then they drown their eyes or break their hearts.
27175,"For men have marble, women waxen, minds,"
27176,And therefore are they formed as marble will;
27177,"The weak oppressed, th’ impression of strange kinds"
27178,"Is formed in them by force, by fraud, or skill."
27179,"Then call them not the authors of their ill,"
27180,"No more than wax shall be accounted evil,"
27181,Wherein is stamped the semblance of a devil.
27182,"Their smoothness, like a goodly champaign plain,"
27183,Lays open all the little worms that creep;
27184,"In men, as in a rough-grown grove, remain"
27185,Cave-keeping evils that obscurely sleep.
27186,Through crystal walls each little mote will peep.
27187,"Though men can cover crimes with bold stern looks,"
27188,Poor women’s faces are their own faults’ books.
27189,"No man inveigh against the withered flower,"
27190,But chide rough winter that the flower hath killed;
27191,"Not that devoured, but that which doth devour,"
27192,"Is worthy blame. O, let it not be hild"
27193,"Poor women’s faults, that they are so fulfilled"
27194,"With men’s abuses! Those proud lords, to blame,"
27195,Make weak-made women tenants to their shame.
27196,"The precedent whereof in Lucrece view,"
27197,Assailed by night with circumstances strong
27198,"Of present death, and shame that might ensue"
27199,"By that her death, to do her husband wrong."
27200,"Such danger to resistance did belong,"
27201,The dying fear through all her body spread;
27202,And who cannot abuse a body dead?
27203,"By this, mild patience bid fair Lucrece speak"
27204,To the poor counterfeit of her complaining:
27205,"“My girl,” quoth she, “on what occasion break"
27206,"Those tears from thee, that down thy cheeks are raining?"
27207,"If thou dost weep for grief of my sustaining,"
27208,"Know, gentle wench, it small avails my mood."
27209,"If tears could help, mine own would do me good."
27210,"“But tell me, girl, when went”—and there she stayed"
27211,Till after a deep groan—“Tarquin from hence?”
27212,"“Madam, ere I was up,” replied the maid,"
27213,“The more to blame my sluggard negligence.
27214,Yet with the fault I thus far can dispense:
27215,"Myself was stirring ere the break of day,"
27216,"And, ere I rose, was Tarquin gone away."
27217,"“But, lady, if your maid may be so bold,"
27218,She would request to know your heaviness.”
27219,"“O peace!” quoth Lucrece. “If it should be told,"
27220,The repetition cannot make it less;
27221,"For more it is than I can well express,"
27222,"And that deep torture may be called a hell,"
27223,When more is felt than one hath power to tell.
27224,"“Go, get me hither paper, ink, and pen."
27225,"Yet save that labour, for I have them here."
27226,What should I say?—One of my husband’s men
27227,Bid thou be ready by and by to bear
27228,"A letter to my lord, my love, my dear."
27229,Bid him with speed prepare to carry it;
27230,"The cause craves haste, and it will soon be writ.”"
27231,"Her maid is gone, and she prepares to write,"
27232,First hovering o’er the paper with her quill.
27233,Conceit and grief an eager combat fight;
27234,What wit sets down is blotted straight with will;
27235,"This is too curious-good, this blunt and ill."
27236,"Much like a press of people at a door,"
27237,"Throng her inventions, which shall go before."
27238,At last she thus begins: “Thou worthy lord
27239,"Of that unworthy wife that greeteth thee,"
27240,"Health to thy person! Next vouchsafe t’ afford,"
27241,"If ever, love, thy Lucrece thou wilt see,"
27242,Some present speed to come and visit me.
27243,So I commend me from our house in grief.
27244,"My woes are tedious, though my words are brief.”"
27245,"Here folds she up the tenor of her woe,"
27246,Her certain sorrow writ uncertainly.
27247,By this short schedule Collatine may know
27248,"Her grief, but not her grief’s true quality;"
27249,"She dares not thereof make discovery,"
27250,"Lest he should hold it her own gross abuse,"
27251,Ere she with blood had stained her stained excuse.
27252,"Besides, the life and feeling of her passion"
27253,"She hoards, to spend when he is by to hear her;"
27254,When sighs and groans and tears may grace the fashion
27255,"Of her disgrace, the better so to clear her"
27256,From that suspicion which the world might bear her.
27257,"To shun this blot, she would not blot the letter"
27258,"With words, till action might become them better."
27259,"To see sad sights moves more than hear them told,"
27260,For then the eye interprets to the ear
27261,"The heavy motion that it doth behold,"
27262,When every part a part of woe doth bear.
27263,’Tis but a part of sorrow that we hear.
27264,"Deep sounds make lesser noise than shallow fords,"
27265,"And sorrow ebbs, being blown with wind of words."
27266,"Her letter now is sealed, and on it writ"
27267,“At Ardea to my lord with more than haste.”
27268,"The post attends, and she delivers it,"
27269,Charging the sour-faced groom to hie as fast
27270,As lagging fowls before the northern blast.
27271,Speed more than speed but dull and slow she deems;
27272,Extremely still urgeth such extremes.
27273,"The homely villain curtsies to her low,"
27274,"And, blushing on her with a steadfast eye,"
27275,"Receives the scroll without or yea or no,"
27276,And forth with bashful innocence doth hie.
27277,But they whose guilt within their bosoms lie
27278,"Imagine every eye beholds their blame,"
27279,"For Lucrece thought he blushed to see her shame,"
27280,"When, silly groom! God wot, it was defect"
27281,"Of spirit, life, and bold audacity."
27282,Such harmless creatures have a true respect
27283,"To talk in deeds, while others saucily"
27284,"Promise more speed, but do it leisurely."
27285,Even so this pattern of the worn-out age
27286,"Pawned honest looks, but laid no words to gage."
27287,"His kindled duty kindled her mistrust,"
27288,That two red fires in both their faces blazed;
27289,"She thought he blushed, as knowing Tarquin’s lust,"
27290,"And, blushing with him, wistly on him gazed."
27291,Her earnest eye did make him more amazed.
27292,"The more she saw the blood his cheeks replenish,"
27293,The more she thought he spied in her some blemish.
27294,"But long she thinks till he return again,"
27295,And yet the duteous vassal scarce is gone.
27296,"The weary time she cannot entertain,"
27297,"For now ’tis stale to sigh, to weep, to groan;"
27298,"So woe hath wearied woe, moan tired moan,"
27299,"That she her plaints a little while doth stay,"
27300,Pausing for means to mourn some newer way.
27301,At last she calls to mind where hangs a piece
27302,"Of skilful painting, made for Priam’s Troy,"
27303,"Before the which is drawn the power of Greece,"
27304,"For Helen’s rape the city to destroy,"
27305,Threat’ning cloud-kissing Ilion with annoy;
27306,"Which the conceited painter drew so proud,"
27307,"As heaven, it seemed,  to kiss the turrets bowed."
27308,"A thousand lamentable objects there,"
27309,"In scorn of Nature, Art gave lifeless life."
27310,"Many a dry drop seemed a weeping tear,"
27311,Shed for the slaughtered husband by the wife.
27312,"The red blood reeked to show the painter’s strife,"
27313,"The dying eyes gleamed forth their ashy lights,"
27314,Like dying coals burnt out in tedious nights.
27315,There might you see the labouring pioneer
27316,Begrimed with sweat and smeared all with dust;
27317,And from the towers of Troy there would appear
27318,"The very eyes of men through loop-holes thrust,"
27319,Gazing upon the Greeks with little lust.
27320,"Such sweet observance in this work was had,"
27321,That one might see those far-off eyes look sad.
27322,In great commanders grace and majesty
27323,"You might behold, triumphing in their faces;"
27324,"In youth, quick bearing and dexterity;"
27325,And here and there the painter interlaces
27326,"Pale cowards marching on with trembling paces,"
27327,"Which heartless peasants did so well resemble,"
27328,That one would swear he saw them quake and tremble.
27329,"In Ajax and Ulysses, O, what art"
27330,Of physiognomy might one behold!
27331,The face of either ciphered either’s heart;
27332,Their face their manners most expressly told.
27333,"In Ajax’ eyes blunt rage and rigour rolled,"
27334,But the mild glance that sly Ulysses lent
27335,Showed deep regard and smiling government.
27336,"There pleading might you see grave Nestor stand,"
27337,"As ’twere encouraging the Greeks to fight,"
27338,Making such sober action with his hand
27339,"That it beguiled attention, charmed the sight."
27340,"In speech, it seemed, his beard, all silver white,"
27341,"Wagged up and down, and from his lips did fly"
27342,"Thin winding breath, which purled up to the sky."
27343,"About him were a press of gaping faces,"
27344,"Which seemed to swallow up his sound advice,"
27345,"All jointly list’ning, but with several graces,"
27346,As if some mermaid did their ears entice;
27347,"Some high, some low, the painter was so nice."
27348,"The scalps of many, almost hid behind,"
27349,To jump up higher seemed to mock the mind.
27350,"Here one man’s hand leaned on another’s head,"
27351,His nose being shadowed by his neighbour’s ear;
27352,"Here one being thronged bears back, all boll’n and red;"
27353,Another smothered seems to pelt and swear;
27354,And in their rage such signs of rage they bear
27355,"As, but for loss of Nestor’s golden words,"
27356,It seemed they would debate with angry swords.
27357,"For much imaginary work was there,"
27358,"Conceit deceitful, so compact, so kind,"
27359,That for Achilles’ image stood his spear
27360,"Griped in an armed hand; himself, behind,"
27361,"Was left unseen, save to the eye of mind."
27362,"A hand, a foot, a face, a leg, a head,"
27363,Stood for the whole to be imagined.
27364,"And from the walls of strong-besieged Troy,"
27365,"When their brave hope, bold Hector, marched to field,"
27366,"Stood many Trojan mothers, sharing joy"
27367,To see their youthful sons bright weapons wield;
27368,And to their hope they such odd action yield
27369,"That through their light joy seemed to appear,"
27370,"Like bright things stained, a kind of heavy fear."
27371,"And from the strand of Dardan, where they fought,"
27372,"To Simois’ reedy banks the red blood ran,"
27373,Whose waves to imitate the battle sought
27374,"With swelling ridges, and their ranks began"
27375,"To break upon the galled shore, and then"
27376,"Retire again till, meeting greater ranks,"
27377,"They join, and shoot their foam at Simois’ banks."
27378,"To this well-painted piece is Lucrece come,"
27379,To find a face where all distress is stelled.
27380,"Many she sees where cares have carved some,"
27381,"But none where all distress and dolour dwelled,"
27382,"Till she despairing Hecuba beheld,"
27383,"Staring on Priam’s wounds with her old eyes,"
27384,Which bleeding under Pyrrhus’ proud foot lies.
27385,In her the painter had anatomized
27386,"Time’s ruin, beauty’s wrack, and grim care’s reign."
27387,Her cheeks with chops and wrinkles were disguised;
27388,Of what she was no semblance did remain.
27389,"Her blue blood, changed to black in every vein,"
27390,"Wanting the spring that those shrunk pipes had fed,"
27391,Showed life imprisoned in a body dead.
27392,"On this sad shadow Lucrece spends her eyes,"
27393,"And shapes her sorrow to the beldam’s woes,"
27394,Who nothing wants to answer her but cries
27395,And bitter words to ban her cruel foes.
27396,"The painter was no god to lend her those,"
27397,"And therefore Lucrece swears he did her wrong,"
27398,"To give her so much grief, and not a tongue."
27399,"“Poor instrument,” quoth she, “without a sound,"
27400,"I’ll tune thy woes with my lamenting tongue,"
27401,"And drop sweet balm in Priam’s painted wound,"
27402,"And rail on Pyrrhus that hath done him wrong,"
27403,"And with my tears quench Troy that burns so long,"
27404,And with my knife scratch out the angry eyes
27405,Of all the Greeks that are thine enemies.
27406,"“Show me the strumpet that began this stir,"
27407,That with my nails her beauty I may tear.
27408,"Thy heat of lust, fond Paris, did incur"
27409,This load of wrath that burning Troy doth bear;
27410,"Thy eye kindled the fire that burneth here,"
27411,"And here in Troy, for trespass of thine eye,"
27412,"The sire, the son, the dame, and daughter die."
27413,“Why should the private pleasure of some one
27414,Become the public plague of many moe?
27415,"Let sin, alone committed, light alone"
27416,Upon his head that hath transgressed so;
27417,Let guiltless souls be freed from guilty woe.
27418,"For one’s offence why should so many fall,"
27419,To plague a private sin in general?
27420,"“Lo, here weeps Hecuba, here Priam dies,"
27421,"Here manly Hector faints, here Troilus swounds;"
27422,"Here friend by friend in bloody channel lies,"
27423,"And friend to friend gives unadvised wounds,"
27424,And one man’s lust these many lives confounds.
27425,"Had doting Priam checked his son’s desire,"
27426,Troy had been bright with fame and not with fire.”
27427,"Here feelingly she weeps Troy’s painted woes,"
27428,"For sorrow, like a heavy-hanging bell,"
27429,"Once set on ringing, with his own weight goes;"
27430,Then little strength rings out the doleful knell.
27431,"So Lucrece set a-work, sad tales doth tell"
27432,To pencilled pensiveness and coloured sorrow;
27433,"She lends them words, and she their looks doth borrow."
27434,"She throws her eyes about the painting round,"
27435,And who she finds forlorn she doth lament.
27436,"At last she sees a wretched image bound,"
27437,That piteous looks to Phrygian shepherds lent.
27438,"His face, though full of cares, yet showed content;"
27439,"Onward to Troy with the blunt swains he goes,"
27440,"So mild, that patience seemed to scorn his woes."
27441,In him the painter laboured with his skill
27442,To hide deceit and give the harmless show
27443,"An humble gait, calm looks, eyes wailing still,"
27444,"A brow unbent that seemed to welcome woe,"
27445,"Cheeks neither red nor pale, but mingled so"
27446,"That blushing red no guilty instance gave,"
27447,Nor ashy pale the fear that false hearts have.
27448,"But, like a constant and confirmed devil,"
27449,"He entertained a show so seeming just,"
27450,"And therein so ensconced his secret evil,"
27451,That jealousy itself could not mistrust
27452,False-creeping craft and perjury should thrust
27453,"Into so bright a day such black-faced storms,"
27454,Or blot with hell-born sin such saint-like forms.
27455,The well-skilled workman this mild image drew
27456,"For perjured Sinon, whose enchanting story"
27457,The credulous Old Priam after slew;
27458,Whose words like wildfire burnt the shining glory
27459,"Of rich-built Ilion, that the skies were sorry,"
27460,"And little stars shot from their fixed places,"
27461,When their glass fell wherein they viewed their faces.
27462,"This picture she advisedly perused,"
27463,"And chid the painter for his wondrous skill,"
27464,Saying some shape in Sinon’s was abused;
27465,So fair a form lodged not a mind so ill.
27466,"And still on him she gazed, and gazing still,"
27467,"Such signs of truth in his plain face she spied,"
27468,That she concludes the picture was belied.
27469,"“It cannot be,” quoth she, “that so much guile”—"
27470,She would have said “can lurk in such a look.”
27471,"But Tarquin’s shape came in her mind the while,"
27472,And from her tongue “can lurk” from “cannot” took.
27473,"“It cannot be” she in that sense forsook,"
27474,"And turned it thus: “It cannot be, I find,"
27475,But such a face should bear a wicked mind.
27476,"“For even as subtle Sinon here is painted,"
27477,"So sober-sad, so weary, and so mild,"
27478,"As if with grief or travail he had fainted,"
27479,"To me came Tarquin armed too, beguiled"
27480,"With outward honesty, but yet defiled"
27481,"With inward vice. As Priam him did cherish,"
27482,So did I Tarquin; so my Troy did perish.
27483,"“Look, look, how listening Priam wets his eyes,"
27484,To see those borrowed tears that Sinon sheds!
27485,"Priam, why art thou old and yet not wise?"
27486,For every tear he falls a Trojan bleeds.
27487,"His eye drops fire, no water thence proceeds;"
27488,"Those round clear pearls of his that move thy pity,"
27489,Are balls of quenchless fire to burn thy city.
27490,"“Such devils steal effects from lightless hell,"
27491,"For Sinon in his fire doth quake with cold,"
27492,And in that cold hot-burning fire doth dwell.
27493,"These contraries such unity do hold,"
27494,Only to flatter fools and make them bold;
27495,"So Priam’s trust false Sinon’s tears doth flatter,"
27496,That he finds means to burn his Troy with water.”
27497,"Here, all enraged, such passion her assails,"
27498,That patience is quite beaten from her breast.
27499,"She tears the senseless Sinon with her nails,"
27500,Comparing him to that unhappy guest
27501,Whose deed hath made herself herself detest.
27502,At last she smilingly with this gives o’er;
27503,"“Fool, fool!” quoth she, “his wounds will not be sore.”"
27504,"Thus ebbs and flows the current of her sorrow,"
27505,And time doth weary time with her complaining.
27506,"She looks for night, and then she longs for morrow,"
27507,And both she thinks too long with her remaining.
27508,Short time seems long in sorrow’s sharp sustaining.
27509,"Though woe be heavy, yet it seldom sleeps,"
27510,And they that watch see time how slow it creeps.
27511,"Which all this time hath overslipped her thought,"
27512,"That she with painted images hath spent,"
27513,Being from the feeling of her own grief brought
27514,"By deep surmise of others’ detriment,"
27515,Losing her woes in shows of discontent.
27516,"It easeth some, though none it ever cured,"
27517,To think their dolour others have endured.
27518,"But now the mindful messenger, come back,"
27519,Brings home his lord and other company;
27520,"Who finds his Lucrece clad in mourning black,"
27521,And round about her tear-distained eye
27522,"Blue circles streamed, like rainbows in the sky."
27523,These water-galls in her dim element
27524,Foretell new storms to those already spent.
27525,"Which when her sad-beholding husband saw,"
27526,Amazedly in her sad face he stares.
27527,"Her eyes, though sod in tears, looked red and raw,"
27528,Her lively colour killed with deadly cares.
27529,He hath no power to ask her how she fares;
27530,"Both stood like old acquaintance in a trance,"
27531,"Met far from home, wond’ring each other’s chance."
27532,"At last he takes her by the bloodless hand,"
27533,And thus begins: “What uncouth ill event
27534,"Hath thee befall’n, that thou dost trembling stand?"
27535,"Sweet love, what spite hath thy fair colour spent?"
27536,Why art thou thus attired in discontent?
27537,"Unmask, dear dear, this moody heaviness,"
27538,"And tell thy grief, that we may give redress.”"
27539,"Three times with sighs she gives her sorrow fire,"
27540,Ere once she can discharge one word of woe.
27541,"At length addressed to answer his desire,"
27542,She modestly prepares to let them know
27543,Her honour is ta’en prisoner by the foe;
27544,While Collatine and his consorted lords
27545,With sad attention long to hear her words.
27546,And now this pale swan in her wat’ry nest
27547,Begins the sad dirge of her certain ending:
27548,"“Few words,” quoth she, “shall fit the trespass best,"
27549,Where no excuse can give the fault amending.
27550,In me more woes than words are now depending;
27551,"And my laments would be drawn out too long,"
27552,To tell them all with one poor tired tongue.
27553,“Then be this all the task it hath to say:
27554,"Dear husband, in the interest of thy bed"
27555,"A stranger came, and on that pillow lay"
27556,Where thou wast wont to rest thy weary head;
27557,And what wrong else may be imagined
27558,"By foul enforcement might be done to me,"
27559,"From that, alas, thy Lucrece is not free."
27560,"“For in the dreadful dead of dark midnight,"
27561,With shining falchion in my chamber came
27562,"A creeping creature with a flaming light,"
27563,"And softly cried ‘Awake, thou Roman dame,"
27564,And entertain my love; else lasting shame
27565,"On thee and thine this night I will inflict,"
27566,If thou my love’s desire do contradict.
27567,"“‘For some hard-favoured groom of thine,’ quoth he,"
27568,"‘Unless thou yoke thy liking to my will,"
27569,"I’ll murder straight, and then I’ll slaughter thee"
27570,And swear I found you where you did fulfil
27571,"The loathsome act of lust, and so did kill"
27572,The lechers in their deed. This act will be
27573,My fame and thy perpetual infamy.’
27574,"“With this, I did begin to start and cry,"
27575,"And then against my heart he sets his sword,"
27576,"Swearing, unless I took all patiently,"
27577,I should not live to speak another word;
27578,"So should my shame still rest upon record,"
27579,And never be forgot in mighty Rome
27580,The adulterate death of Lucrece and her groom.
27581,"“Mine enemy was strong, my poor self weak,"
27582,And far the weaker with so strong a fear.
27583,My bloody judge forbade my tongue to speak;
27584,No rightful plea might plead for justice there.
27585,His scarlet lust came evidence to swear
27586,That my poor beauty had purloined his eyes;
27587,"And when the judge is robbed, the prisoner dies."
27588,"“O, teach me how to make mine own excuse,"
27589,"Or at the least, this refuge let me find:"
27590,"Though my gross blood be stained with this abuse,"
27591,Immaculate and spotless is my mind;
27592,That was not forced; that never was inclined
27593,"To accessary yieldings, but still pure"
27594,Doth in her poisoned closet yet endure.”
27595,"Lo, here the hopeless merchant of this loss,"
27596,"With head declined and voice dammed up with woe,"
27597,"With sad set eyes and wretched arms across,"
27598,From lips new-waxen pale begins to blow
27599,The grief away that stops his answer so.
27600,"But wretched as he is, he strives in vain;"
27601,What he breathes out his breath drinks up again.
27602,As through an arch the violent roaring tide
27603,"Outruns the eye that doth behold his haste,"
27604,Yet in the eddy boundeth in his pride
27605,"Back to the strait that forced him on so fast,"
27606,"In rage sent out, recalled in rage, being past:"
27607,"Even so his sighs, his sorrows make a saw,"
27608,"To push grief on, and back the same grief draw."
27609,"Which speechless woe of his poor she attendeth,"
27610,And his untimely frenzy thus awaketh:
27611,"“Dear lord, thy sorrow to my sorrow lendeth"
27612,Another power; no flood by raining slaketh.
27613,My woe too sensible thy passion maketh
27614,More feeling-painful. Let it then suffice
27615,"To drown one woe, one pair of weeping eyes."
27616,"“And for my sake, when I might charm thee so,"
27617,"For she that was thy Lucrece, now attend me:"
27618,"Be suddenly revenged on my foe,"
27619,"Thine, mine, his own. Suppose thou dost defend me"
27620,From what is past. The help that thou shalt lend me
27621,"Comes all too late, yet let the traitor die,"
27622,For sparing justice feeds iniquity.
27623,"“But ere I name him, you fair lords,” quoth she,"
27624,"Speaking to those that came with Collatine,"
27625,"“Shall plight your honourable faiths to me,"
27626,With swift pursuit to venge this wrong of mine;
27627,For ’tis a meritorious fair design
27628,To chase injustice with revengeful arms.
27629,"Knights, by their oaths, should right poor ladies’ harms.”"
27630,"At this request, with noble disposition"
27631,"Each present lord began to promise aid,"
27632,"As bound in knighthood to her imposition,"
27633,Longing to hear the hateful foe bewrayed.
27634,"But she, that yet her sad task hath not said,"
27635,"The protestation stops. “O, speak,” quoth she,"
27636,“How may this forced stain be wiped from me?
27637,"“What is the quality of my offence,"
27638,Being constrained with dreadful circumstance?
27639,"May my pure mind with the foul act dispense,"
27640,My low-declined honour to advance?
27641,May any terms acquit me from this chance?
27642,"The poisoned fountain clears itself again,"
27643,And why not I from this compelled stain?
27644,"With this, they all at once began to say,"
27645,"Her body’s stain her mind untainted clears,"
27646,While with a joyless smile she turns away
27647,"The face, that map which deep impression bears"
27648,"Of hard misfortune, carved in it with tears."
27649,"“No, no,” quoth she, “no dame, hereafter living"
27650,By my excuse shall claim excuse’s giving.”
27651,"Here with a sigh, as if her heart would break,"
27652,"She throws forth Tarquin’s name: “He, he,” she says,"
27653,But more than “he” her poor tongue could not speak;
27654,"Till after many accents and delays,"
27655,"Untimely breathings, sick and short assays,"
27656,"She utters this: “He, he, fair lords, ’tis he,"
27657,That guides this hand to give this wound to me.”
27658,Even here she sheathed in her harmless breast
27659,"A harmful knife, that thence her soul unsheathed."
27660,That blow did bail it from the deep unrest
27661,Of that polluted prison where it breathed.
27662,Her contrite sighs unto the clouds bequeathed
27663,"Her winged sprite, and through her wounds doth fly"
27664,Life’s lasting date from cancelled destiny.
27665,"Stone-still, astonished with this deadly deed,"
27666,"Stood Collatine and all his lordly crew,"
27667,"Till Lucrece’ father that beholds her bleed,"
27668,"Himself on her self-slaughtered body threw,"
27669,And from the purple fountain Brutus drew
27670,"The murd’rous knife, and, as it left the place,"
27671,"Her blood, in poor revenge, held it in chase;"
27672,"And bubbling from her breast, it doth divide"
27673,"In two slow rivers, that the crimson blood"
27674,"Circles her body in on every side,"
27675,"Who, like a late-sacked island, vastly stood"
27676,Bare and unpeopled in this fearful flood.
27677,"Some of her blood still pure and red remained,"
27678,"And some looked black, and that false Tarquin stained."
27679,About the mourning and congealed face
27680,"Of that black blood a wat’ry rigol goes,"
27681,Which seems to weep upon the tainted place;
27682,"And ever since, as pitying Lucrece’ woes,"
27683,"Corrupted blood some watery token shows,"
27684,"And blood untainted still doth red abide,"
27685,Blushing at that which is so putrified.
27686,"“Daughter, dear daughter,” old Lucretius cries,"
27687,“That life was mine which thou hast here deprived.
27688,"If in the child the father’s image lies,"
27689,Where shall I live now Lucrece is unlived?
27690,Thou wast not to this end from me derived.
27691,"If children predecease progenitors,"
27692,"We are their offspring, and they none of ours."
27693,"“Poor broken glass, I often did behold"
27694,In thy sweet semblance my old age new born;
27695,"But now that fair fresh mirror, dim and old,"
27696,Shows me a bare-boned death by time outworn.
27697,"O, from thy cheeks my image thou hast torn,"
27698,"And shivered all the beauty of my glass,"
27699,That I no more can see what once I was!
27700,"“O time, cease thou thy course and last no longer,"
27701,If they surcease to be that should survive!
27702,"Shall rotten death make conquest of the stronger,"
27703,And leave the falt’ring feeble souls alive?
27704,"The old bees die, the young possess their hive."
27705,"Then live, sweet Lucrece, live again and see"
27706,"Thy father die, and not thy father thee!”"
27707,"By this starts Collatine as from a dream,"
27708,And bids Lucretius give his sorrow place;
27709,And then in key-cold Lucrece’ bleeding stream
27710,"He falls, and bathes the pale fear in his face,"
27711,And counterfeits to die with her a space;
27712,"Till manly shame bids him possess his breath,"
27713,And live to be revenged on her death.
27714,The deep vexation of his inward soul
27715,Hath served a dumb arrest upon his tongue;
27716,"Who, mad that sorrow should his use control"
27717,"Or keep him from heart-easing words so long,"
27718,Begins to talk; but through his lips do throng
27719,"Weak words, so thick come in his poor heart’s aid"
27720,That no man could distinguish what he said.
27721,"Yet sometime “Tarquin” was pronounced plain,"
27722,"But through his teeth, as if the name he tore."
27723,"This windy tempest, till it blow up rain,"
27724,"Held back his sorrow’s tide, to make it more."
27725,"At last it rains, and busy winds give o’er."
27726,Then son and father weep with equal strife
27727,"Who should weep most, for daughter or for wife."
27728,"The one doth call her his, the other his,"
27729,"Yet neither may possess the claim they lay,"
27730,"The father says “She’s mine.” “O, mine she is,”"
27731,Replies her husband. “Do not take away
27732,My sorrow’s interest; let no mourner say
27733,"He weeps for her, for she was only mine,"
27734,And only must be wailed by Collatine.”
27735,"“O,” quoth Lucretius, “I did give that life"
27736,Which she too early and too late hath spilled.”
27737,"“Woe, woe,” quoth Collatine, “she was my wife,"
27738,"I owed her, and ’tis mine that she hath killed.”"
27739,“My daughter” and “my wife” with clamours filled
27740,"The dispersed air, who, holding Lucrece’ life,"
27741,"Answered their cries, “my daughter” and “my wife”."
27742,"Brutus, who plucked the knife from Lucrece’ side,"
27743,"Seeing such emulation in their woe,"
27744,"Began to clothe his wit in state and pride,"
27745,Burying in Lucrece’ wound his folly’s show.
27746,He with the Romans was esteemed so
27747,"As silly jeering idiots are with kings,"
27748,For sportive words and utt’ring foolish things.
27749,"But now he throws that shallow habit by,"
27750,"Wherein deep policy did him disguise,"
27751,"And armed his long-hid wits advisedly,"
27752,To check the tears in Collatinus’ eyes.
27753,"“Thou wronged lord of Rome,” quoth he, “arise!"
27754,"Let my unsounded self, supposed a fool,"
27755,Now set thy long-experienced wit to school.
27756,"“Why, Collatine, is woe the cure for woe?"
27757,"Do wounds help wounds, or grief help grievous deeds?"
27758,Is it revenge to give thyself a blow
27759,For his foul act by whom thy fair wife bleeds?
27760,Such childish humour from weak minds proceeds.
27761,"Thy wretched wife mistook the matter so,"
27762,"To slay herself, that should have slain her foe."
27763,"“Courageous Roman, do not steep thy heart"
27764,"In such relenting dew of lamentations,"
27765,"But kneel with me, and help to bear thy part"
27766,"To rouse our Roman gods with invocations,"
27767,"That they will suffer these abominations,—"
27768,"Since Rome herself in them doth stand disgraced,—"
27769,By our strong arms from forth her fair streets chased.
27770,"“Now, by the Capitol that we adore,"
27771,"And by this chaste blood so unjustly stained,"
27772,"By heaven’s fair sun that breeds the fat earth’s store,"
27773,"By all our country rights in Rome maintained,"
27774,And by chaste Lucrece’ soul that late complained
27775,"Her wrongs to us, and by this bloody knife,"
27776,We will revenge the death of this true wife.”
27777,"This said, he struck his hand upon his breast,"
27778,"And kissed the fatal knife, to end his vow;"
27779,"And to his protestation urged the rest,"
27780,"Who, wond’ring at him, did his words allow."
27781,"Then jointly to the ground their knees they bow,"
27782,"And that deep vow which Brutus made before,"
27783,"He doth again repeat, and that they swore."
27784,"When they had sworn to this advised doom,"
27785,"They did conclude to bear dead Lucrece thence,"
27786,"To show her bleeding body thorough Rome,"
27787,And so to publish Tarquin’s foul offence;
27788,"Which being done with speedy diligence,"
27789,The Romans plausibly did give consent
27790,To Tarquin’s everlasting banishment.
27791,_Vilia miretur vulgus; mihi flavus Apollo
27792,Pocula Castalia plena ministret aqua._
27793,"HENRY WRIOTHESLEY,  EARL OF SOUTHAMPTON,"
27794,and Baron of Titchfield.
27795,"Right Honourable, I know not how I shall offend in dedicating my"
27796,"unpolished lines to your lordship, nor how the world will censure me"
27797,"for choosing so strong a prop to support so weak a burthen: only, if"
27798,"your honour seem but pleased, I account myself highly praised, and vow"
27799,"to take advantage of all idle hours, till I have honoured you with some"
27800,"graver labour. But if the first heir of my invention prove deformed, I"
27801,"shall be sorry it had so noble a godfather, and never after ear so"
27802,"barren a land, for fear it yield me still so bad a harvest. I leave it"
27803,"to your honourable survey, and your honour to your heart’s content;"
27804,which I wish may always answer your own wish and the world’s hopeful
27805,"Your honour’s in all duty,"
27806,Even as the sun with purple-colour’d face
27807,"Had ta’en his last leave of the weeping morn,"
27808,Rose-cheek’d Adonis tried him to the chase;
27809,"Hunting he lov’d, but love he laugh’d to scorn;"
27810,"Sick-thoughted Venus makes amain unto him,"
27811,And like a bold-fac’d suitor ’gins to woo him.
27812,"“Thrice fairer than myself,” thus she began,"
27813,"“The field’s chief flower, sweet above compare,"
27814,"Stain to all nymphs, more lovely than a man,"
27815,More white and red than doves or roses are:
27816,"Nature that made thee, with herself at strife,"
27817,Saith that the world hath ending with thy life.
27818,"“Vouchsafe, thou wonder, to alight thy steed,"
27819,And rein his proud head to the saddle-bow;
27820,"If thou wilt deign this favour, for thy meed"
27821,A thousand honey secrets shalt thou know:
27822,"Here come and sit, where never serpent hisses,"
27823,"And being set, I’ll smother thee with kisses."
27824,"“And yet not cloy thy lips with loath’d satiety,"
27825,"But rather famish them amid their plenty,"
27826,"Making them red, and pale, with fresh variety:"
27827,"Ten kisses short as one, one long as twenty:"
27828,"A summer’s day will seem an hour but short,"
27829,Being wasted in such time-beguiling sport.”
27830,"With this she seizeth on his sweating palm,"
27831,"The precedent of pith and livelihood,"
27832,"And trembling in her passion, calls it balm,"
27833,Earth’s sovereign salve to do a goddess good:
27834,"Being so enrag’d, desire doth lend her force"
27835,Courageously to pluck him from his horse.
27836,"Over one arm the lusty courser’s rein,"
27837,"Under her other was the tender boy,"
27838,"Who blush’d and pouted in a dull disdain,"
27839,"With leaden appetite, unapt to toy;"
27840,"She red and hot as coals of glowing fire,"
27841,"He red for shame, but frosty in desire."
27842,The studded bridle on a ragged bough
27843,Nimbly she fastens;—O! how quick is love!—
27844,"The steed is stalled up, and even now"
27845,To tie the rider she begins to prove:
27846,"Backward she push’d him, as she would be thrust,"
27847,"And govern’d him in strength, though not in lust."
27848,"So soon was she along, as he was down,"
27849,Each leaning on their elbows and their hips:
27850,"Now doth she stroke his cheek, now doth he frown,"
27851,"And ’gins to chide, but soon she stops his lips,"
27852,"And kissing speaks, with lustful language broken,"
27853,"“If thou wilt chide, thy lips shall never open.”"
27854,"He burns with bashful shame, she with her tears"
27855,Doth quench the maiden burning of his cheeks;
27856,Then with her windy sighs and golden hairs
27857,To fan and blow them dry again she seeks.
27858,"He saith she is immodest, blames her miss;"
27859,"What follows more, she murders with a kiss."
27860,"Even as an empty eagle, sharp by fast,"
27861,"Tires with her beak on feathers, flesh and bone,"
27862,"Shaking her wings, devouring all in haste,"
27863,Till either gorge be stuff’d or prey be gone:
27864,"Even so she kiss’d his brow, his cheek, his chin,"
27865,And where she ends she doth anew begin.
27866,"Forc’d to content, but never to obey,"
27867,"Panting he lies, and breatheth in her face."
27868,"She feedeth on the steam, as on a prey,"
27869,"And calls it heavenly moisture, air of grace,"
27870,Wishing her cheeks were gardens full of flowers
27871,So they were dew’d with such distilling showers.
27872,"Look how a bird lies tangled in a net,"
27873,So fasten’d in her arms Adonis lies;
27874,"Pure shame and aw’d resistance made him fret,"
27875,Which bred more beauty in his angry eyes:
27876,Rain added to a river that is rank
27877,Perforce will force it overflow the bank.
27878,"Still she entreats, and prettily entreats,"
27879,For to a pretty ear she tunes her tale.
27880,"Still is he sullen, still he lours and frets,"
27881,’Twixt crimson shame and anger ashy pale;
27882,"Being red she loves him best, and being white,"
27883,Her best is better’d with a more delight.
27884,"Look how he can, she cannot choose but love;"
27885,"And by her fair immortal hand she swears,"
27886,"From his soft bosom never to remove,"
27887,"Till he take truce with her contending tears,"
27888,"Which long have rain’d, making her cheeks all wet;"
27889,And one sweet kiss shall pay this countless debt.
27890,"Upon this promise did he raise his chin,"
27891,"Like a dive-dapper peering through a wave,"
27892,"Who, being look’d on, ducks as quickly in;"
27893,"So offers he to give what she did crave,"
27894,"But when her lips were ready for his pay,"
27895,"He winks, and turns his lips another way."
27896,Never did passenger in summer’s heat
27897,More thirst for drink than she for this good turn.
27898,"Her help she sees, but help she cannot get;"
27899,"She bathes in water, yet her fire must burn:"
27900,"“O! pity,” ’gan she cry, “flint-hearted boy,"
27901,’Tis but a kiss I beg; why art thou coy?
27902,"“I have been woo’d as I entreat thee now,"
27903,"Even by the stern and direful god of war,"
27904,"Whose sinewy neck in battle ne’er did bow,"
27905,Who conquers where he comes in every jar;
27906,"Yet hath he been my captive and my slave,"
27907,And begg’d for that which thou unask’d shalt have.
27908,"“Over my altars hath he hung his lance,"
27909,"His batter’d shield, his uncontrolled crest,"
27910,"And for my sake hath learn’d to sport and dance,"
27911,"To toy, to wanton, dally, smile, and jest;"
27912,Scorning his churlish drum and ensign red
27913,"Making my arms his field, his tent my bed."
27914,"“Thus he that overrul’d I oversway’d,"
27915,Leading him prisoner in a red rose chain:
27916,"Strong-temper’d steel his stronger strength obey’d,"
27917,Yet was he servile to my coy disdain.
27918,"Oh be not proud, nor brag not of thy might,"
27919,For mast’ring her that foil’d the god of fight.
27920,"“Touch but my lips with those fair lips of thine,"
27921,"Though mine be not so fair, yet are they red,"
27922,The kiss shall be thine own as well as mine:
27923,"What see’st thou in the ground? hold up thy head,"
27924,"Look in mine eyeballs, there thy beauty lies;"
27925,"Then why not lips on lips, since eyes in eyes?"
27926,"“Art thou asham’d to kiss? then wink again,"
27927,And I will wink; so shall the day seem night.
27928,Love keeps his revels where there are but twain;
27929,"Be bold to play, our sport is not in sight,"
27930,These blue-vein’d violets whereon we lean
27931,"Never can blab, nor know not what we mean."
27932,“The tender spring upon thy tempting lip
27933,"Shows thee unripe; yet mayst thou well be tasted,"
27934,"Make use of time, let not advantage slip;"
27935,"Beauty within itself should not be wasted,"
27936,Fair flowers that are not gather’d in their prime
27937,"Rot, and consume themselves in little time."
27938,"“Were I hard-favour’d, foul, or wrinkled old,"
27939,"Ill-nurtur’d, crooked, churlish, harsh in voice,"
27940,"O’erworn, despised, rheumatic, and cold,"
27941,"Thick-sighted, barren, lean, and lacking juice,"
27942,"Then mightst thou pause, for then I were not for thee;"
27943,"But having no defects, why dost abhor me?"
27944,"“Thou canst not see one wrinkle in my brow,"
27945,"Mine eyes are grey and bright, and quick in turning;"
27946,"My beauty as the spring doth yearly grow,"
27947,"My flesh is soft and plump, my marrow burning,"
27948,"My smooth moist hand, were it with thy hand felt,"
27949,"Would in thy palm dissolve, or seem to melt."
27950,"“Bid me discourse, I will enchant thine ear,"
27951,"Or like a fairy, trip upon the green,"
27952,"Or like a nymph, with long dishevell’d hair,"
27953,"Dance on the sands, and yet no footing seen."
27954,"Love is a spirit all compact of fire,"
27955,"Not gross to sink, but light, and will aspire."
27956,“Witness this primrose bank whereon I lie:
27957,These forceless flowers like sturdy trees support me;
27958,"Two strengthless doves will draw me through the sky,"
27959,"From morn till night, even where I list to sport me."
27960,"Is love so light, sweet boy, and may it be"
27961,That thou shouldst think it heavy unto thee?
27962,“Is thine own heart to thine own face affected?
27963,Can thy right hand seize love upon thy left?
27964,"Then woo thyself, be of thyself rejected,"
27965,"Steal thine own freedom, and complain on theft."
27966,"Narcissus so himself himself forsook,"
27967,And died to kiss his shadow in the brook.
27968,"“Torches are made to light, jewels to wear,"
27969,"Dainties to taste, fresh beauty for the use,"
27970,"Herbs for their smell, and sappy plants to bear;"
27971,"Things growing to themselves are growth’s abuse,"
27972,"Seeds spring from seeds, and beauty breedeth beauty;"
27973,Thou wast begot; to get it is thy duty.
27974,"“Upon the earth’s increase why shouldst thou feed,"
27975,Unless the earth with thy increase be fed?
27976,"By law of nature thou art bound to breed,"
27977,That thine may live when thou thyself art dead;
27978,"And so in spite of death thou dost survive,"
27979,In that thy likeness still is left alive.”
27980,"By this the love-sick queen began to sweat,"
27981,"For where they lay the shadow had forsook them,"
27982,"And Titan, tired in the midday heat,"
27983,"With burning eye did hotly overlook them,"
27984,"Wishing Adonis had his team to guide,"
27985,So he were like him and by Venus’ side.
27986,"And now Adonis with a lazy spright,"
27987,"And with a heavy, dark, disliking eye,"
27988,"His louring brows o’erwhelming his fair sight,"
27989,"Like misty vapours when they blot the sky,"
27990,"Souring his cheeks, cries, “Fie, no more of love:"
27991,The sun doth burn my face; I must remove.”
27992,"“Ay me,” quoth Venus, “young, and so unkind!"
27993,What bare excuses mak’st thou to be gone!
27994,"I’ll sigh celestial breath, whose gentle wind"
27995,Shall cool the heat of this descending sun:
27996,I’ll make a shadow for thee of my hairs;
27997,"If they burn too, I’ll quench them with my tears."
27998,"“The sun that shines from heaven shines but warm,"
27999,And lo I lie between that sun and thee:
28000,"The heat I have from thence doth little harm,"
28001,Thine eye darts forth the fire that burneth me;
28002,"And were I not immortal, life were done,"
28003,Between this heavenly and earthly sun.
28004,"“Art thou obdurate, flinty, hard as steel?"
28005,"Nay more than flint, for stone at rain relenteth:"
28006,Art thou a woman’s son and canst not feel
28007,"What ’tis to love, how want of love tormenteth?"
28008,"O had thy mother borne so hard a mind,"
28009,"She had not brought forth thee, but died unkind."
28010,“What am I that thou shouldst contemn me this?
28011,Or what great danger dwells upon my suit?
28012,What were thy lips the worse for one poor kiss?
28013,"Speak, fair; but speak fair words, or else be mute:"
28014,"Give me one kiss, I’ll give it thee again,"
28015,"And one for int’rest, if thou wilt have twain."
28016,"“Fie, lifeless picture, cold and senseless stone,"
28017,"Well-painted idol, image dull and dead,"
28018,"Statue contenting but the eye alone,"
28019,"Thing like a man, but of no woman bred:"
28020,"Thou art no man, though of a man’s complexion,"
28021,For men will kiss even by their own direction.”
28022,"This said, impatience chokes her pleading tongue,"
28023,And swelling passion doth provoke a pause;
28024,Red cheeks and fiery eyes blaze forth her wrong;
28025,"Being judge in love, she cannot right her cause."
28026,"And now she weeps, and now she fain would speak,"
28027,And now her sobs do her intendments break.
28028,"Sometimes she shakes her head, and then his hand,"
28029,"Now gazeth she on him, now on the ground;"
28030,Sometimes her arms infold him like a band:
28031,"She would, he will not in her arms be bound;"
28032,"And when from thence he struggles to be gone,"
28033,She locks her lily fingers one in one.
28034,"“Fondling,” she saith, “since I have hemm’d thee here"
28035,"Within the circuit of this ivory pale,"
28036,"I’ll be a park, and thou shalt be my deer;"
28037,"Feed where thou wilt, on mountain or in dale:"
28038,"Graze on my lips, and if those hills be dry,"
28039,"Stray lower, where the pleasant fountains lie."
28040,"“Within this limit is relief enough,"
28041,"Sweet bottom grass and high delightful plain,"
28042,"Round rising hillocks, brakes obscure and rough,"
28043,To shelter thee from tempest and from rain:
28044,"Then be my deer, since I am such a park,"
28045,"No dog shall rouse thee, though a thousand bark.”"
28046,"At this Adonis smiles as in disdain,"
28047,That in each cheek appears a pretty dimple;
28048,"Love made those hollows, if himself were slain,"
28049,He might be buried in a tomb so simple;
28050,"Foreknowing well, if there he came to lie,"
28051,"Why there love liv’d, and there he could not die."
28052,"These lovely caves, these round enchanting pits,"
28053,Open’d their mouths to swallow Venus’ liking.
28054,"Being mad before, how doth she now for wits?"
28055,"Struck dead at first, what needs a second striking?"
28056,"Poor queen of love, in thine own law forlorn,"
28057,To love a cheek that smiles at thee in scorn!
28058,Now which way shall she turn? what shall she say?
28059,"Her words are done, her woes the more increasing;"
28060,"The time is spent, her object will away,"
28061,And from her twining arms doth urge releasing:
28062,"“Pity,” she cries; “some favour, some remorse!”"
28063,"Away he springs, and hasteth to his horse."
28064,"But lo from forth a copse that neighbours by,"
28065,"A breeding jennet, lusty, young, and proud,"
28066,"Adonis’ tramping courser doth espy,"
28067,"And forth she rushes, snorts and neighs aloud:"
28068,"The strong-neck’d steed, being tied unto a tree,"
28069,"Breaketh his rein, and to her straight goes he."
28070,"Imperiously he leaps, he neighs, he bounds,"
28071,And now his woven girths he breaks asunder;
28072,"The bearing earth with his hard hoof he wounds,"
28073,Whose hollow womb resounds like heaven’s thunder;
28074,"The iron bit he crusheth ’tween his teeth,"
28075,Controlling what he was controlled with.
28076,His ears up-prick’d; his braided hanging mane
28077,Upon his compass’d crest now stand on end;
28078,"His nostrils drink the air, and forth again,"
28079,"As from a furnace, vapours doth he send:"
28080,"His eye, which scornfully glisters like fire,"
28081,Shows his hot courage and his high desire.
28082,"Sometime he trots, as if he told the steps,"
28083,With gentle majesty and modest pride;
28084,"Anon he rears upright, curvets and leaps,"
28085,"As who should say, “Lo thus my strength is tried;"
28086,And this I do to captivate the eye
28087,Of the fair breeder that is standing by.”
28088,"What recketh he his rider’s angry stir,"
28089,"His flattering “Holla”, or his “Stand, I say”?"
28090,What cares he now for curb or pricking spur?
28091,For rich caparisons or trappings gay?
28092,"He sees his love, and nothing else he sees,"
28093,Nor nothing else with his proud sight agrees.
28094,"Look when a painter would surpass the life,"
28095,"In limning out a well-proportion’d steed,"
28096,"His art with nature’s workmanship at strife,"
28097,As if the dead the living should exceed:
28098,"So did this horse excel a common one,"
28099,"In shape, in courage, colour, pace and bone."
28100,"Round-hoof’d, short-jointed, fetlocks shag and long,"
28101,"Broad breast, full eye, small head, and nostril wide,"
28102,"High crest, short ears, straight legs and passing strong,"
28103,"Thin mane, thick tail, broad buttock, tender hide:"
28104,"Look, what a horse should have he did not lack,"
28105,Save a proud rider on so proud a back.
28106,"Sometimes he scuds far off, and there he stares;"
28107,Anon he starts at stirring of a feather:
28108,"To bid the wind a base he now prepares,"
28109,And where he run or fly they know not whether;
28110,"For through his mane and tail the high wind sings,"
28111,"Fanning the hairs, who wave like feather’d wings."
28112,"He looks upon his love, and neighs unto her;"
28113,"She answers him as if she knew his mind,"
28114,"Being proud, as females are, to see him woo her,"
28115,"She puts on outward strangeness, seems unkind,"
28116,"Spurns at his love and scorns the heat he feels,"
28117,Beating his kind embracements with her heels.
28118,"Then like a melancholy malcontent,"
28119,"He vails his tail that like a falling plume,"
28120,Cool shadow to his melting buttock lent:
28121,"He stamps, and bites the poor flies in his fume."
28122,"His love, perceiving how he was enrag’d,"
28123,"Grew kinder, and his fury was assuag’d."
28124,"His testy master goeth about to take him,"
28125,"When lo the unback’d breeder, full of fear,"
28126,"Jealous of catching, swiftly doth forsake him,"
28127,"With her the horse, and left Adonis there:"
28128,"As they were mad, unto the wood they hie them,"
28129,Outstripping crows that strive to overfly them.
28130,"All swoln with chafing, down Adonis sits,"
28131,Banning his boisterous and unruly beast;
28132,And now the happy season once more fits
28133,That love-sick love by pleading may be blest;
28134,"For lovers say, the heart hath treble wrong,"
28135,When it is barr’d the aidance of the tongue.
28136,"An oven that is stopp’d, or river stay’d,"
28137,"Burneth more hotly, swelleth with more rage:"
28138,"So of concealed sorrow may be said,"
28139,Free vent of words love’s fire doth assuage;
28140,"But when the heart’s attorney once is mute,"
28141,"The client breaks, as desperate in his suit."
28142,"He sees her coming, and begins to glow,"
28143,"Even as a dying coal revives with wind,"
28144,"And with his bonnet hides his angry brow,"
28145,"Looks on the dull earth with disturbed mind,"
28146,"Taking no notice that she is so nigh,"
28147,For all askance he holds her in his eye.
28148,"O what a sight it was, wistly to view"
28149,"How she came stealing to the wayward boy,"
28150,"To note the fighting conflict of her hue,"
28151,How white and red each other did destroy:
28152,"But now her cheek was pale, and by and by"
28153,"It flash’d forth fire, as lightning from the sky."
28154,"Now was she just before him as he sat,"
28155,And like a lowly lover down she kneels;
28156,"With one fair hand she heaveth up his hat,"
28157,Her other tender hand his fair cheek feels:
28158,"His tend’rer cheek receives her soft hand’s print,"
28159,As apt as new-fall’n snow takes any dint.
28160,"Oh what a war of looks was then between them,"
28161,"Her eyes petitioners to his eyes suing,"
28162,"His eyes saw her eyes, as they had not seen them,"
28163,"Her eyes woo’d still, his eyes disdain’d the wooing:"
28164,And all this dumb play had his acts made plain
28165,"With tears, which, chorus-like, her eyes did rain."
28166,"Full gently now she takes him by the hand,"
28167,"A lily prison’d in a gaol of snow,"
28168,"Or ivory in an alabaster band,"
28169,So white a friend engirts so white a foe:
28170,"This beauteous combat, wilful and unwilling,"
28171,Show’d like two silver doves that sit a-billing.
28172,Once more the engine of her thoughts began:
28173,"“O fairest mover on this mortal round,"
28174,"Would thou wert as I am, and I a man,"
28175,"My heart all whole as thine, thy heart my wound,"
28176,"For one sweet look thy help I would assure thee,"
28177,Though nothing but my body’s bane would cure thee.”
28178,"“Give me my hand,” saith he, “why dost thou feel it?”"
28179,"“Give me my heart,” saith she, “and thou shalt have it."
28180,"O give it me lest thy hard heart do steel it,"
28181,"And being steel’d, soft sighs can never grave it."
28182,"Then love’s deep groans I never shall regard,"
28183,Because Adonis’ heart hath made mine hard.”
28184,"“For shame,” he cries, “let go, and let me go,"
28185,"My day’s delight is past, my horse is gone,"
28186,"And ’tis your fault I am bereft him so,"
28187,"I pray you hence, and leave me here alone,"
28188,"For all my mind, my thought, my busy care,"
28189,Is how to get my palfrey from the mare.”
28190,"Thus she replies: “Thy palfrey as he should,"
28191,"Welcomes the warm approach of sweet desire,"
28192,Affection is a coal that must be cool’d;
28193,"Else, suffer’d, it will set the heart on fire,"
28194,"The sea hath bounds, but deep desire hath none;"
28195,Therefore no marvel though thy horse be gone.
28196,"“How like a jade he stood tied to the tree,"
28197,Servilely master’d with a leathern rein!
28198,"But when he saw his love, his youth’s fair fee,"
28199,He held such petty bondage in disdain;
28200,"Throwing the base thong from his bending crest,"
28201,"Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast."
28202,"“Who sees his true-love in her naked bed,"
28203,"Teaching the sheets a whiter hue than white,"
28204,"But when his glutton eye so full hath fed,"
28205,His other agents aim at like delight?
28206,Who is so faint that dare not be so bold
28207,"To touch the fire, the weather being cold?"
28208,"“Let me excuse thy courser, gentle boy,"
28209,"And learn of him, I heartily beseech thee,"
28210,"To take advantage on presented joy,"
28211,"Though I were dumb, yet his proceedings teach thee."
28212,"O learn to love, the lesson is but plain,"
28213,"And once made perfect, never lost again.”"
28214,"“I know not love,” quoth he, “nor will not know it,"
28215,"Unless it be a boar, and then I chase it;"
28216,"’Tis much to borrow, and I will not owe it;"
28217,My love to love is love but to disgrace it;
28218,"For I have heard, it is a life in death,"
28219,"That laughs and weeps, and all but with a breath."
28220,“Who wears a garment shapeless and unfinish’d?
28221,Who plucks the bud before one leaf put forth?
28222,"If springing things be any jot diminish’d,"
28223,"They wither in their prime, prove nothing worth;"
28224,"The colt that’s back’d and burden’d being young,"
28225,"Loseth his pride, and never waxeth strong."
28226,"“You hurt my hand with wringing. Let us part,"
28227,"And leave this idle theme, this bootless chat:"
28228,"Remove your siege from my unyielding heart,"
28229,To love’s alarms it will not ope the gate:
28230,"Dismiss your vows, your feigned tears, your flatt’ry;"
28231,For where a heart is hard they make no batt’ry.”
28232,"“What! canst thou talk?” quoth she, “hast thou a tongue?"
28233,"O would thou hadst not, or I had no hearing;"
28234,Thy mermaid’s voice hath done me double wrong;
28235,"I had my load before, now press’d with bearing:"
28236,"Melodious discord, heavenly tune, harsh-sounding,"
28237,"Ear’s deep sweet music, and heart’s deep sore wounding."
28238,"“Had I no eyes but ears, my ears would love"
28239,That inward beauty and invisible;
28240,"Or were I deaf, thy outward parts would move"
28241,Each part in me that were but sensible:
28242,"Though neither eyes nor ears, to hear nor see,"
28243,Yet should I be in love by touching thee.
28244,"“Say that the sense of feeling were bereft me,"
28245,"And that I could not see, nor hear, nor touch,"
28246,"And nothing but the very smell were left me,"
28247,Yet would my love to thee be still as much;
28248,For from the stillitory of thy face excelling
28249,"Comes breath perfum’d, that breedeth love by smelling."
28250,"“But oh what banquet wert thou to the taste,"
28251,Being nurse and feeder of the other four;
28252,"Would they not wish the feast might ever last,"
28253,"And bid suspicion double-lock the door,"
28254,"Lest jealousy, that sour unwelcome guest,"
28255,Should by his stealing in disturb the feast?”
28256,"Once more the ruby-colour’d portal open’d,"
28257,"Which to his speech did honey passage yield,"
28258,Like a red morn that ever yet betoken’d
28259,"Wrack to the seaman, tempest to the field,"
28260,"Sorrow to shepherds, woe unto the birds,"
28261,Gusts and foul flaws to herdmen and to herds.
28262,This ill presage advisedly she marketh:
28263,"Even as the wind is hush’d before it raineth,"
28264,"Or as the wolf doth grin before he barketh,"
28265,"Or as the berry breaks before it staineth,"
28266,"Or like the deadly bullet of a gun,"
28267,His meaning struck her ere his words begun.
28268,And at his look she flatly falleth down
28269,"For looks kill love, and love by looks reviveth;"
28270,A smile recures the wounding of a frown;
28271,"But blessed bankrout, that by love so thriveth!"
28272,"The silly boy, believing she is dead,"
28273,"Claps her pale cheek, till clapping makes it red."
28274,"And all amaz’d brake off his late intent,"
28275,"For sharply he did think to reprehend her,"
28276,Which cunning love did wittily prevent:
28277,Fair fall the wit that can so well defend her!
28278,"For on the grass she lies as she were slain,"
28279,Till his breath breatheth life in her again.
28280,"He wrings her nose, he strikes her on the cheeks,"
28281,"He bends her fingers, holds her pulses hard,"
28282,He chafes her lips; a thousand ways he seeks
28283,To mend the hurt that his unkindness marr’d:
28284,"He kisses her; and she, by her good will,"
28285,"Will never rise, so he will kiss her still."
28286,The night of sorrow now is turn’d to day:
28287,"Her two blue windows faintly she up-heaveth,"
28288,Like the fair sun when in his fresh array
28289,"He cheers the morn, and all the world relieveth:"
28290,"And as the bright sun glorifies the sky,"
28291,So is her face illumin’d with her eye.
28292,"Whose beams upon his hairless face are fix’d,"
28293,As if from thence they borrow’d all their shine.
28294,"Were never four such lamps together mix’d,"
28295,Had not his clouded with his brow’s repine;
28296,"But hers, which through the crystal tears gave light"
28297,Shone like the moon in water seen by night.
28298,"“O where am I?” quoth she, “in earth or heaven?"
28299,"Or in the ocean drench’d, or in the fire?"
28300,What hour is this? or morn or weary even?
28301,"Do I delight to die, or life desire?"
28302,"But now I liv’d, and life was death’s annoy;"
28303,"But now I died, and death was lively joy."
28304,“O thou didst kill me; kill me once again:
28305,"Thy eyes’ shrewd tutor, that hard heart of thine,"
28306,"Hath taught them scornful tricks, and such disdain,"
28307,That they have murder’d this poor heart of mine;
28308,"And these mine eyes, true leaders to their queen,"
28309,But for thy piteous lips no more had seen.
28310,“Long may they kiss each other for this cure!
28311,"Oh never let their crimson liveries wear,"
28312,"And as they last, their verdure still endure,"
28313,To drive infection from the dangerous year:
28314,"That the star-gazers, having writ on death,"
28315,"May say, the plague is banish’d by thy breath."
28316,"“Pure lips, sweet seals in my soft lips imprinted,"
28317,"What bargains may I make, still to be sealing?"
28318,"To sell myself I can be well contented,"
28319,"So thou wilt buy, and pay, and use good dealing;"
28320,"Which purchase if thou make, for fear of slips,"
28321,Set thy seal manual on my wax-red lips.
28322,“A thousand kisses buys my heart from me;
28323,"And pay them at thy leisure, one by one,"
28324,What is ten hundred touches unto thee?
28325,Are they not quickly told and quickly gone?
28326,"Say, for non-payment that the debt should double,"
28327,Is twenty hundred kisses such a trouble?”
28328,"“Fair queen,” quoth he, “if any love you owe me,"
28329,Measure my strangeness with my unripe years:
28330,"Before I know myself, seek not to know me;"
28331,No fisher but the ungrown fry forbears:
28332,"The mellow plum doth fall, the green sticks fast,"
28333,"Or being early pluck’d, is sour to taste."
28334,"“Look the world’s comforter, with weary gait"
28335,His day’s hot task hath ended in the west;
28336,"The owl, night’s herald, shrieks, ’tis very late;"
28337,"The sheep are gone to fold, birds to their nest,"
28338,And coal-black clouds that shadow heaven’s light
28339,"Do summon us to part, and bid good night."
28340,"“Now let me say good night, and so say you;"
28341,"If you will say so, you shall have a kiss.”"
28342,"“Good night,” quoth she; and ere he says adieu,"
28343,The honey fee of parting tender’d is:
28344,Her arms do lend his neck a sweet embrace;
28345,"Incorporate then they seem, face grows to face."
28346,"Till breathless he disjoin’d, and backward drew"
28347,"The heavenly moisture, that sweet coral mouth,"
28348,"Whose precious taste her thirsty lips well knew,"
28349,"Whereon they surfeit, yet complain on drouth,"
28350,"He with her plenty press’d, she faint with dearth,"
28351,"Their lips together glued, fall to the earth."
28352,"Now quick desire hath caught the yielding prey,"
28353,"And glutton-like she feeds, yet never filleth;"
28354,"Her lips are conquerors, his lips obey,"
28355,Paying what ransom the insulter willeth;
28356,"Whose vulture thought doth pitch the price so high,"
28357,That she will draw his lips’ rich treasure dry.
28358,"And having felt the sweetness of the spoil,"
28359,With blindfold fury she begins to forage;
28360,"Her face doth reek and smoke, her blood doth boil,"
28361,"And careless lust stirs up a desperate courage,"
28362,"Planting oblivion, beating reason back,"
28363,Forgetting shame’s pure blush and honour’s wrack.
28364,"Hot, faint, and weary, with her hard embracing,"
28365,"Like a wild bird being tam’d with too much handling,"
28366,"Or as the fleet-foot roe that’s tir’d with chasing,"
28367,Or like the froward infant still’d with dandling:
28368,"He now obeys, and now no more resisteth,"
28369,"While she takes all she can, not all she listeth."
28370,"What wax so frozen but dissolves with temp’ring,"
28371,And yields at last to every light impression?
28372,"Things out of hope are compass’d oft with vent’ring,"
28373,"Chiefly in love, whose leave exceeds commission:"
28374,"Affection faints not like a pale-fac’d coward,"
28375,But then woos best when most his choice is froward.
28376,"When he did frown, O had she then gave over,"
28377,Such nectar from his lips she had not suck’d.
28378,Foul words and frowns must not repel a lover;
28379,"What though the rose have prickles, yet ’tis pluck’d."
28380,"Were beauty under twenty locks kept fast,"
28381,"Yet love breaks through, and picks them all at last."
28382,For pity now she can no more detain him;
28383,The poor fool prays her that he may depart:
28384,"She is resolv’d no longer to restrain him,"
28385,"Bids him farewell, and look well to her heart,"
28386,"The which by Cupid’s bow she doth protest,"
28387,He carries thence encaged in his breast.
28388,"“Sweet boy,” she says, “this night I’ll waste in sorrow,"
28389,For my sick heart commands mine eyes to watch.
28390,"Tell me, love’s master, shall we meet tomorrow"
28391,"Say, shall we? shall we? wilt thou make the match?”"
28392,"He tells her no, tomorrow he intends"
28393,To hunt the boar with certain of his friends.
28394,"“The boar!” quoth she; whereat a sudden pale,"
28395,"Like lawn being spread upon the blushing rose,"
28396,"Usurps her cheek, she trembles at his tale,"
28397,And on his neck her yoking arms she throws.
28398,"She sinketh down, still hanging by his neck,"
28399,"He on her belly falls, she on her back."
28400,"Now is she in the very lists of love,"
28401,Her champion mounted for the hot encounter:
28402,"All is imaginary she doth prove,"
28403,"He will not manage her, although he mount her;"
28404,"That worse than Tantalus’ is her annoy,"
28405,To clip Elysium and to lack her joy.
28406,"Even as poor birds, deceiv’d with painted grapes,"
28407,Do surfeit by the eye and pine the maw:
28408,"Even so she languisheth in her mishaps,"
28409,As those poor birds that helpless berries saw.
28410,"The warm effects which she in him finds missing,"
28411,She seeks to kindle with continual kissing.
28412,"But all in vain, good queen, it will not be,"
28413,She hath assay’d as much as may be prov’d;
28414,Her pleading hath deserv’d a greater fee;
28415,"She’s love, she loves, and yet she is not lov’d."
28416,"“Fie, fie,” he says, “you crush me; let me go;"
28417,You have no reason to withhold me so.”
28418,"“Thou hadst been gone,” quoth she, “sweet boy, ere this,"
28419,But that thou told’st me thou wouldst hunt the boar.
28420,"Oh be advis’d; thou know’st not what it is,"
28421,"With javelin’s point a churlish swine to gore,"
28422,"Whose tushes never sheath’d he whetteth still,"
28423,"Like to a mortal butcher, bent to kill."
28424,“On his bow-back he hath a battle set
28425,"Of bristly pikes, that ever threat his foes;"
28426,His eyes like glow-worms shine when he doth fret;
28427,His snout digs sepulchres where’er he goes;
28428,"Being mov’d, he strikes whate’er is in his way,"
28429,And whom he strikes his crooked tushes slay.
28430,"“His brawny sides, with hairy bristles armed,"
28431,Are better proof than thy spear’s point can enter;
28432,His short thick neck cannot be easily harmed;
28433,"Being ireful, on the lion he will venture:"
28434,"The thorny brambles and embracing bushes,"
28435,"As fearful of him, part, through whom he rushes."
28436,"“Alas! he naught esteems that face of thine,"
28437,To which love’s eyes pay tributary gazes;
28438,"Nor thy soft hands, sweet lips, and crystal eyne,"
28439,Whose full perfection all the world amazes;
28440,"But having thee at vantage, wondrous dread!"
28441,Would root these beauties as he roots the mead.
28442,"“Oh let him keep his loathsome cabin still,"
28443,Beauty hath naught to do with such foul fiends:
28444,Come not within his danger by thy will;
28445,"They that thrive well, take counsel of their friends."
28446,"When thou didst name the boar, not to dissemble,"
28447,"I fear’d thy fortune, and my joints did tremble."
28448,"“Didst thou not mark my face, was it not white?"
28449,Saw’st thou not signs of fear lurk in mine eye?
28450,"Grew I not faint, and fell I not downright?"
28451,"Within my bosom, whereon thou dost lie,"
28452,"My boding heart pants, beats, and takes no rest,"
28453,"But like an earthquake, shakes thee on my breast."
28454,"“For where love reigns, disturbing jealousy"
28455,Doth call himself affection’s sentinel;
28456,"Gives false alarms, suggesteth mutiny,"
28457,"And in a peaceful hour doth cry “Kill, kill!”"
28458,"Distemp’ring gentle love in his desire,"
28459,As air and water do abate the fire.
28460,"“This sour informer, this bate-breeding spy,"
28461,"This canker that eats up love’s tender spring,"
28462,"This carry-tale, dissentious jealousy,"
28463,"That sometime true news, sometime false doth bring,"
28464,"Knocks at my heart, and whispers in mine ear,"
28465,"That if I love thee, I thy death should fear."
28466,"“And more than so, presenteth to mine eye"
28467,"The picture of an angry chafing boar,"
28468,Under whose sharp fangs on his back doth lie
28469,"An image like thyself, all stain’d with gore;"
28470,"Whose blood upon the fresh flowers being shed,"
28471,Doth make them droop with grief and hang the head.
28472,"“What should I do, seeing thee so indeed,"
28473,That tremble at th’imagination?
28474,"The thought of it doth make my faint heart bleed,"
28475,And fear doth teach it divination:
28476,"I prophesy thy death, my living sorrow,"
28477,If thou encounter with the boar tomorrow.
28478,"“But if thou needs wilt hunt, be rul’d by me;"
28479,"Uncouple at the timorous flying hare,"
28480,"Or at the fox which lives by subtilty,"
28481,Or at the roe which no encounter dare:
28482,"Pursue these fearful creatures o’er the downs,"
28483,And on thy well-breath’d horse keep with thy hounds.
28484,"“And when thou hast on foot the purblind hare,"
28485,"Mark the poor wretch, to overshoot his troubles"
28486,"How he outruns the wind, and with what care"
28487,He cranks and crosses with a thousand doubles:
28488,The many musits through the which he goes
28489,Are like a labyrinth to amaze his foes.
28490,"“Sometime he runs among a flock of sheep,"
28491,"To make the cunning hounds mistake their smell,"
28492,"And sometime where earth-delving conies keep,"
28493,"To stop the loud pursuers in their yell,"
28494,And sometime sorteth with a herd of deer;
28495,"Danger deviseth shifts, wit waits on fear."
28496,"“For there his smell with others being mingled,"
28497,"The hot scent-snuffing hounds are driven to doubt,"
28498,"Ceasing their clamorous cry, till they have singled"
28499,With much ado the cold fault cleanly out;
28500,"Then do they spend their mouths: echo replies,"
28501,As if another chase were in the skies.
28502,"“By this, poor Wat, far off upon a hill,"
28503,"Stands on his hinder legs with list’ning ear,"
28504,To hearken if his foes pursue him still.
28505,Anon their loud alarums he doth hear;
28506,And now his grief may be compared well
28507,To one sore sick that hears the passing bell.
28508,“Then shalt thou see the dew-bedabbled wretch
28509,"Turn, and return, indenting with the way,"
28510,"Each envious briar his weary legs do scratch,"
28511,"Each shadow makes him stop, each murmur stay:"
28512,"For misery is trodden on by many,"
28513,And being low never reliev’d by any.
28514,"“Lie quietly, and hear a little more;"
28515,"Nay, do not struggle, for thou shalt not rise:"
28516,"To make thee hate the hunting of the boar,"
28517,"Unlike myself thou hear’st me moralize,"
28518,"Applying this to that, and so to so,"
28519,For love can comment upon every woe.
28520,"“Where did I leave?” “No matter where,” quoth he"
28521,"“Leave me, and then the story aptly ends:"
28522,"The night is spent.” “Why, what of that?” quoth she."
28523,"“I am,” quoth he, “expected of my friends;"
28524,"And now ’tis dark, and going I shall fall.”"
28525,"“In night,” quoth she, “desire sees best of all.”"
28526,"But if thou fall, oh then imagine this,"
28527,"The earth, in love with thee, thy footing trips,"
28528,And all is but to rob thee of a kiss.
28529,Rich preys make true men thieves; so do thy lips
28530,"Make modest Dian cloudy and forlorn,"
28531,Lest she should steal a kiss and die forsworn.
28532,“Now of this dark night I perceive the reason:
28533,Cynthia for shame obscures her silver shine
28534,"Till forging nature be condemn’d of treason,"
28535,"For stealing moulds from heaven, that were divine;"
28536,"Wherein she fram’d thee, in high heaven’s despite,"
28537,To shame the sun by day and her by night.
28538,"“And therefore hath she brib’d the destinies,"
28539,"To cross the curious workmanship of nature,"
28540,"To mingle beauty with infirmities,"
28541,"And pure perfection with impure defeature,"
28542,Making it subject to the tyranny
28543,Of mad mischances and much misery.
28544,"“As burning fevers, agues pale and faint,"
28545,"Life-poisoning pestilence and frenzies wood,"
28546,"The marrow-eating sickness, whose attaint"
28547,Disorder breeds by heating of the blood;
28548,"Surfeits, imposthumes, grief, and damn’d despair,"
28549,"Swear nature’s death, for framing thee so fair."
28550,“And not the least of all these maladies
28551,But in one minute’s fight brings beauty under:
28552,"Both favour, savour, hue and qualities,"
28553,"Whereat th’impartial gazer late did wonder,"
28554,"Are on the sudden wasted, thaw’d and done,"
28555,As mountain snow melts with the midday sun.
28556,"“Therefore despite of fruitless chastity,"
28557,"Love-lacking vestals and self-loving nuns,"
28558,That on the earth would breed a scarcity
28559,"And barren dearth of daughters and of sons,"
28560,Be prodigal: the lamp that burns by night
28561,Dries up his oil to lend the world his light.
28562,"“What is thy body but a swallowing grave,"
28563,"Seeming to bury that posterity,"
28564,"Which by the rights of time thou needs must have,"
28565,If thou destroy them not in dark obscurity?
28566,"If so, the world will hold thee in disdain,"
28567,Sith in thy pride so fair a hope is slain.
28568,“So in thyself thyself art made away;
28569,"A mischief worse than civil home-bred strife,"
28570,"Or theirs whose desperate hands themselves do slay,"
28571,Or butcher sire that reeves his son of life.
28572,"Foul cank’ring rust the hidden treasure frets,"
28573,But gold that’s put to use more gold begets.”
28574,"“Nay then,” quoth Adon, “you will fall again"
28575,Into your idle over-handled theme;
28576,"The kiss I gave you is bestow’d in vain,"
28577,And all in vain you strive against the stream;
28578,"For by this black-fac’d night, desire’s foul nurse,"
28579,Your treatise makes me like you worse and worse.
28580,"“If love have lent you twenty thousand tongues,"
28581,"And every tongue more moving than your own,"
28582,"Bewitching like the wanton mermaid’s songs,"
28583,Yet from mine ear the tempting tune is blown;
28584,"For know, my heart stands armed in mine ear,"
28585,And will not let a false sound enter there.
28586,“Lest the deceiving harmony should run
28587,"Into the quiet closure of my breast,"
28588,"And then my little heart were quite undone,"
28589,In his bedchamber to be barr’d of rest.
28590,"No, lady, no; my heart longs not to groan,"
28591,"But soundly sleeps, while now it sleeps alone."
28592,“What have you urg’d that I cannot reprove?
28593,The path is smooth that leadeth on to danger;
28594,"I hate not love, but your device in love"
28595,That lends embracements unto every stranger.
28596,You do it for increase: O strange excuse!
28597,When reason is the bawd to lust’s abuse.
28598,"“Call it not, love, for love to heaven is fled,"
28599,Since sweating lust on earth usurp’d his name;
28600,Under whose simple semblance he hath fed
28601,"Upon fresh beauty, blotting it with blame;"
28602,"Which the hot tyrant stains and soon bereaves,"
28603,As caterpillars do the tender leaves.
28604,"“Love comforteth like sunshine after rain,"
28605,But lust’s effect is tempest after sun;
28606,"Love’s gentle spring doth always fresh remain,"
28607,Lust’s winter comes ere summer half be done.
28608,"Love surfeits not, lust like a glutton dies;"
28609,"Love is all truth, lust full of forged lies."
28610,"“More I could tell, but more I dare not say;"
28611,"The text is old, the orator too green."
28612,"Therefore, in sadness, now I will away;"
28613,"My face is full of shame, my heart of teen,"
28614,"Mine ears, that to your wanton talk attended"
28615,Do burn themselves for having so offended.”
28616,With this he breaketh from the sweet embrace
28617,"Of those fair arms which bound him to her breast,"
28618,And homeward through the dark laund runs apace;
28619,Leaves love upon her back deeply distress’d.
28620,"Look how a bright star shooteth from the sky,"
28621,So glides he in the night from Venus’ eye.
28622,"Which after him she darts, as one on shore"
28623,"Gazing upon a late embarked friend,"
28624,"Till the wild waves will have him seen no more,"
28625,Whose ridges with the meeting clouds contend:
28626,So did the merciless and pitchy night
28627,Fold in the object that did feed her sight.
28628,"Whereat amaz’d, as one that unaware"
28629,"Hath dropp’d a precious jewel in the flood,"
28630,"Or ’stonish’d as night-wanderers often are,"
28631,Their light blown out in some mistrustful wood;
28632,"Even so confounded in the dark she lay,"
28633,Having lost the fair discovery of her way.
28634,"And now she beats her heart, whereat it groans,"
28635,"That all the neighbour caves, as seeming troubled,"
28636,Make verbal repetition of her moans;
28637,Passion on passion deeply is redoubled:
28638,"“Ay me!” she cries, and twenty times, “Woe, woe!”"
28639,And twenty echoes twenty times cry so.
28640,"She marking them, begins a wailing note,"
28641,And sings extemporally a woeful ditty;
28642,"How love makes young men thrall, and old men dote,"
28643,How love is wise in folly foolish witty:
28644,"Her heavy anthem still concludes in woe,"
28645,And still the choir of echoes answer so.
28646,"Her song was tedious, and outwore the night,"
28647,"For lovers’ hours are long, though seeming short,"
28648,"If pleas’d themselves, others they think, delight"
28649,"In such like circumstance, with such like sport:"
28650,"Their copious stories oftentimes begun,"
28651,"End without audience, and are never done."
28652,"For who hath she to spend the night withal,"
28653,But idle sounds resembling parasites;
28654,"Like shrill-tongu’d tapsters answering every call,"
28655,Soothing the humour of fantastic wits?
28656,"She says, “’Tis so:” they answer all, “’Tis so;”"
28657,"And would say after her, if she said “No.”"
28658,"Lo here the gentle lark, weary of rest,"
28659,"From his moist cabinet mounts up on high,"
28660,"And wakes the morning, from whose silver breast"
28661,The sun ariseth in his majesty;
28662,"Who doth the world so gloriously behold,"
28663,That cedar tops and hills seem burnish’d gold.
28664,Venus salutes him with this fair good morrow:
28665,"“Oh thou clear god, and patron of all light,"
28666,From whom each lamp and shining star doth borrow
28667,"The beauteous influence that makes him bright,"
28668,"There lives a son that suck’d an earthly mother,"
28669,"May lend thee light, as thou dost lend to other.”"
28670,"This said, she hasteth to a myrtle grove,"
28671,"Musing the morning is so much o’erworn,"
28672,And yet she hears no tidings of her love;
28673,She hearkens for his hounds and for his horn.
28674,"Anon she hears them chant it lustily,"
28675,And all in haste she coasteth to the cry.
28676,"And as she runs, the bushes in the way"
28677,"Some catch her by the neck, some kiss her face,"
28678,Some twine about her thigh to make her stay:
28679,"She wildly breaketh from their strict embrace,"
28680,"Like a milch doe, whose swelling dugs do ache,"
28681,Hasting to feed her fawn hid in some brake.
28682,"By this she hears the hounds are at a bay,"
28683,Whereat she starts like one that spies an adder
28684,"Wreath’d up in fatal folds just in his way,"
28685,The fear whereof doth make him shake and shudder;
28686,Even so the timorous yelping of the hounds
28687,"Appals her senses, and her spirit confounds."
28688,"For now she knows it is no gentle chase,"
28689,"But the blunt boar, rough bear, or lion proud,"
28690,"Because the cry remaineth in one place,"
28691,"Where fearfully the dogs exclaim aloud,"
28692,"Finding their enemy to be so curst,"
28693,They all strain court’sy who shall cope him first.
28694,"This dismal cry rings sadly in her ear,"
28695,Through which it enters to surprise her heart;
28696,"Who overcome by doubt and bloodless fear,"
28697,With cold-pale weakness numbs each feeling part;
28698,"Like soldiers when their captain once doth yield,"
28699,They basely fly and dare not stay the field.
28700,"Thus stands she in a trembling ecstasy,"
28701,"Till cheering up her senses sore dismay’d,"
28702,"She tells them ’tis a causeless fantasy,"
28703,"And childish error, that they are afraid;"
28704,"Bids them leave quaking, bids them fear no more:"
28705,"And with that word, she spied the hunted boar."
28706,"Whose frothy mouth bepainted all with red,"
28707,"Like milk and blood being mingled both together,"
28708,"A second fear through all her sinews spread,"
28709,Which madly hurries her she knows not whither:
28710,"This way she runs, and now she will no further,"
28711,"But back retires, to rate the boar for murther."
28712,"A thousand spleens bear her a thousand ways,"
28713,She treads the path that she untreads again;
28714,"Her more than haste is mated with delays,"
28715,"Like the proceedings of a drunken brain,"
28716,"Full of respects, yet naught at all respecting,"
28717,"In hand with all things, naught at all effecting."
28718,"Here kennel’d in a brake she finds a hound,"
28719,"And asks the weary caitiff for his master,"
28720,"And there another licking of his wound,"
28721,’Gainst venom’d sores the only sovereign plaster.
28722,"And here she meets another sadly scowling,"
28723,"To whom she speaks, and he replies with howling."
28724,"When he hath ceas’d his ill-resounding noise,"
28725,"Another flap-mouth’d mourner, black and grim,"
28726,Against the welkin volleys out his voice;
28727,"Another and another answer him,"
28728,"Clapping their proud tails to the ground below,"
28729,"Shaking their scratch’d ears, bleeding as they go."
28730,Look how the world’s poor people are amazed
28731,"At apparitions, signs, and prodigies,"
28732,"Whereon with fearful eyes they long have gazed,"
28733,Infusing them with dreadful prophecies;
28734,"So she at these sad sighs draws up her breath,"
28735,"And sighing it again, exclaims on death."
28736,"“Hard-favour’d tyrant, ugly, meagre, lean,"
28737,"Hateful divorce of love,” thus chides she death,"
28738,"“Grim-grinning ghost, earth’s worm, what dost thou mean?"
28739,"To stifle beauty and to steal his breath,"
28740,"Who when he liv’d, his breath and beauty set"
28741,"Gloss on the rose, smell to the violet."
28742,"“If he be dead, O no, it cannot be,"
28743,"Seeing his beauty, thou shouldst strike at it,"
28744,"O yes, it may, thou hast no eyes to see,"
28745,But hatefully at random dost thou hit.
28746,"Thy mark is feeble age, but thy false dart"
28747,"Mistakes that aim, and cleaves an infant’s heart."
28748,"“Hadst thou but bid beware, then he had spoke,"
28749,"And hearing him, thy power had lost his power."
28750,The destinies will curse thee for this stroke;
28751,"They bid thee crop a weed, thou pluck’st a flower."
28752,"Love’s golden arrow at him should have fled,"
28753,And not death’s ebon dart to strike him dead.
28754,"“Dost thou drink tears, that thou provok’st such weeping?"
28755,What may a heavy groan advantage thee?
28756,Why hast thou cast into eternal sleeping
28757,Those eyes that taught all other eyes to see?
28758,"Now nature cares not for thy mortal vigour,"
28759,Since her best work is ruin’d with thy rigour.”
28760,"Here overcome, as one full of despair,"
28761,"She vail’d her eyelids, who like sluices stopp’d"
28762,The crystal tide that from her two cheeks fair
28763,In the sweet channel of her bosom dropp’d
28764,"But through the flood-gates breaks the silver rain,"
28765,And with his strong course opens them again.
28766,O how her eyes and tears did lend and borrow;
28767,"Her eyes seen in the tears, tears in her eye;"
28768,"Both crystals, where they view’d each other’s sorrow,"
28769,Sorrow that friendly sighs sought still to dry;
28770,"But like a stormy day, now wind, now rain,"
28771,"Sighs dry her cheeks, tears make them wet again."
28772,"Variable passions throng her constant woe,"
28773,As striving who should best become her grief;
28774,"All entertain’d, each passion labours so,"
28775,"That every present sorrow seemeth chief,"
28776,"But none is best, then join they all together,"
28777,Like many clouds consulting for foul weather.
28778,"By this, far off she hears some huntsman holla;"
28779,A nurse’s song ne’er pleas’d her babe so well:
28780,The dire imagination she did follow
28781,This sound of hope doth labour to expel;
28782,"For now reviving joy bids her rejoice,"
28783,And flatters her it is Adonis’ voice.
28784,"Whereat her tears began to turn their tide,"
28785,"Being prison’d in her eye, like pearls in glass;"
28786,"Yet sometimes falls an orient drop beside,"
28787,"Which her cheek melts, as scorning it should pass"
28788,"To wash the foul face of the sluttish ground,"
28789,Who is but drunken when she seemeth drown’d.
28790,"O hard-believing love, how strange it seems"
28791,"Not to believe, and yet too credulous;"
28792,Thy weal and woe are both of them extremes;
28793,"Despair and hope make thee ridiculous,"
28794,"The one doth flatter thee in thoughts unlikely,"
28795,In likely thoughts the other kills thee quickly.
28796,"Now she unweaves the web that she hath wrought,"
28797,"Adonis lives, and death is not to blame;"
28798,It was not she that call’d him all to naught;
28799,Now she adds honours to his hateful name.
28800,"She clepes him king of graves, and grave for kings,"
28801,Imperious supreme of all mortal things.
28802,"“No, no,” quoth she, “sweet death, I did but jest;"
28803,"Yet pardon me, I felt a kind of fear"
28804,"Whenas I met the boar, that bloody beast,"
28805,"Which knows no pity, but is still severe;"
28806,"Then, gentle shadow,—truth I must confess—"
28807,"I rail’d on thee, fearing my love’s decease."
28808,"“’Tis not my fault, the boar provok’d my tongue;"
28809,"Be wreak’d on him, invisible commander;"
28810,"’Tis he, foul creature, that hath done thee wrong;"
28811,"I did but act, he’s author of my slander."
28812,"Grief hath two tongues, and never woman yet,"
28813,"Could rule them both, without ten women’s wit.”"
28814,"Thus hoping that Adonis is alive,"
28815,Her rash suspect she doth extenuate;
28816,"And that his beauty may the better thrive,"
28817,With death she humbly doth insinuate;
28818,"Tells him of trophies, statues, tombs and stories"
28819,"His victories, his triumphs and his glories."
28820,"“O love!” quoth she, “how much a fool was I,"
28821,"To be of such a weak and silly mind,"
28822,"To wail his death who lives, and must not die"
28823,Till mutual overthrow of mortal kind;
28824,"For he being dead, with him is beauty slain,"
28825,"And beauty dead, black Chaos comes again."
28826,"“Fie, fie, fond love, thou art as full of fear"
28827,"As one with treasure laden, hemm’d with thieves,"
28828,"Trifles unwitnessed with eye or ear,"
28829,Thy coward heart with false bethinking grieves.”
28830,"Even at this word she hears a merry horn,"
28831,Whereat she leaps that was but late forlorn.
28832,"As falcon to the lure, away she flies;"
28833,"The grass stoops not, she treads on it so light,"
28834,And in her haste unfortunately spies
28835,The foul boar’s conquest on her fair delight;
28836,"Which seen, her eyes, as murder’d with the view,"
28837,"Like stars asham’d of day, themselves withdrew."
28838,"Or as the snail, whose tender horns being hit,"
28839,"Shrinks backwards in his shelly cave with pain,"
28840,"And there all smother’d up, in shade doth sit,"
28841,Long after fearing to creep forth again:
28842,So at his bloody view her eyes are fled
28843,Into the deep dark cabins of her head.
28844,Where they resign their office and their light
28845,"To the disposing of her troubled brain,"
28846,"Who bids them still consort with ugly night,"
28847,And never wound the heart with looks again;
28848,"Who like a king perplexed in his throne,"
28849,By their suggestion gives a deadly groan.
28850,"Whereat each tributary subject quakes,"
28851,"As when the wind imprison’d in the ground,"
28852,"Struggling for passage, earth’s foundation shakes,"
28853,Which with cold terror doth men’s minds confound.
28854,This mutiny each part doth so surprise
28855,That from their dark beds once more leap her eyes.
28856,"And being open’d, threw unwilling light"
28857,Upon the wide wound that the boar had trench’d
28858,"In his soft flank, whose wonted lily white"
28859,"With purple tears that his wound wept, was drench’d."
28860,"No flower was nigh, no grass, herb, leaf or weed,"
28861,But stole his blood and seem’d with him to bleed.
28862,"This solemn sympathy poor Venus noteth,"
28863,"Over one shoulder doth she hang her head,"
28864,"Dumbly she passions, franticly she doteth;"
28865,"She thinks he could not die, he is not dead:"
28866,"Her voice is stopp’d, her joints forget to bow,"
28867,"Her eyes are mad, that they have wept till now."
28868,"Upon his hurt she looks so steadfastly,"
28869,That her sight dazzling makes the wound seem three;
28870,"And then she reprehends her mangling eye,"
28871,"That makes more gashes, where no breach should be:"
28872,"His face seems twain, each several limb is doubled,"
28873,"For oft the eye mistakes, the brain being troubled."
28874,"“My tongue cannot express my grief for one,"
28875,"And yet,” quoth she, “behold two Adons dead!"
28876,"My sighs are blown away, my salt tears gone,"
28877,"Mine eyes are turn’d to fire, my heart to lead:"
28878,"Heavy heart’s lead, melt at mine eyes’ red fire!"
28879,So shall I die by drops of hot desire.
28880,"“Alas poor world, what treasure hast thou lost!"
28881,What face remains alive that’s worth the viewing?
28882,Whose tongue is music now? what canst thou boast
28883,"Of things long since, or anything ensuing?"
28884,"The flowers are sweet, their colours fresh and trim,"
28885,But true sweet beauty liv’d and died with him.
28886,“Bonnet nor veil henceforth no creature wear!
28887,Nor sun nor wind will ever strive to kiss you:
28888,"Having no fair to lose, you need not fear;"
28889,"The sun doth scorn you, and the wind doth hiss you."
28890,"But when Adonis liv’d, sun and sharp air"
28891,"Lurk’d like two thieves, to rob him of his fair."
28892,"“And therefore would he put his bonnet on,"
28893,Under whose brim the gaudy sun would peep;
28894,"The wind would blow it off, and being gone,"
28895,Play with his locks; then would Adonis weep;
28896,"And straight, in pity of his tender years,"
28897,They both would strive who first should dry his tears.
28898,“To see his face the lion walk’d along
28899,"Behind some hedge, because he would not fear him;"
28900,"To recreate himself when he hath sung,"
28901,The tiger would be tame and gently hear him.
28902,"If he had spoke, the wolf would leave his prey,"
28903,And never fright the silly lamb that day.
28904,"“When he beheld his shadow in the brook,"
28905,The fishes spread on it their golden gills;
28906,"When he was by, the birds such pleasure took,"
28907,"That some would sing, some other in their bills"
28908,"Would bring him mulberries and ripe-red cherries,"
28909,"He fed them with his sight, they him with berries."
28910,"“But this foul, grim, and urchin-snouted boar,"
28911,"Whose downward eye still looketh for a grave,"
28912,Ne’er saw the beauteous livery that he wore;
28913,Witness the entertainment that he gave.
28914,"If he did see his face, why then I know"
28915,"He thought to kiss him, and hath kill’d him so."
28916,"“’Tis true, ’tis true; thus was Adonis slain:"
28917,"He ran upon the boar with his sharp spear,"
28918,"Who did not whet his teeth at him again,"
28919,But by a kiss thought to persuade him there;
28920,"And nuzzling in his flank, the loving swine"
28921,Sheath’d unaware the tusk in his soft groin.
28922,"“Had I been tooth’d like him, I must confess,"
28923,With kissing him I should have kill’d him first;
28924,"But he is dead, and never did he bless"
28925,My youth with his; the more am I accurst.”
28926,"With this she falleth in the place she stood,"
28927,And stains her face with his congealed blood.
28928,"She looks upon his lips, and they are pale;"
28929,"She takes him by the hand, and that is cold,"
28930,"She whispers in his ears a heavy tale,"
28931,As if they heard the woeful words she told;
28932,"She lifts the coffer-lids that close his eyes,"
28933,"Where lo, two lamps burnt out in darkness lies."
28934,Two glasses where herself herself beheld
28935,"A thousand times, and now no more reflect;"
28936,"Their virtue lost, wherein they late excell’d,"
28937,And every beauty robb’d of his effect.
28938,"“Wonder of time,” quoth she, “this is my spite,"
28939,"That thou being dead, the day should yet be light."
28940,"“Since thou art dead, lo here I prophesy,"
28941,Sorrow on love hereafter shall attend:
28942,"It shall be waited on with jealousy,"
28943,"Find sweet beginning, but unsavoury end;"
28944,"Ne’er settled equally, but high or low,"
28945,That all love’s pleasure shall not match his woe.
28946,"“It shall be fickle, false and full of fraud,"
28947,"Bud, and be blasted in a breathing while;"
28948,"The bottom poison, and the top o’erstraw’d"
28949,With sweets that shall the truest sight beguile.
28950,"The strongest body shall it make most weak,"
28951,"Strike the wise dumb, and teach the fool to speak."
28952,"“It shall be sparing, and too full of riot,"
28953,Teaching decrepit age to tread the measures;
28954,"The staring ruffian shall it keep in quiet,"
28955,"Pluck down the rich, enrich the poor with treasures;"
28956,"It shall be raging mad, and silly mild,"
28957,"Make the young old, the old become a child."
28958,"“It shall suspect where is no cause of fear,"
28959,It shall not fear where it should most mistrust;
28960,"It shall be merciful, and too severe,"
28961,And most deceiving when it seems most just;
28962,"Perverse it shall be, where it shows most toward,"
28963,"Put fear to valour, courage to the coward."
28964,"“It shall be cause of war and dire events,"
28965,And set dissension ’twixt the son and sire;
28966,"Subject and servile to all discontents,"
28967,"As dry combustious matter is to fire,"
28968,"Sith in his prime death doth my love destroy,"
28969,They that love best their love shall not enjoy.”
28970,By this the boy that by her side lay kill’d
28971,"Was melted like a vapour from her sight,"
28972,"And in his blood that on the ground lay spill’d,"
28973,"A purple flower sprung up, chequer’d with white,"
28974,"Resembling well his pale cheeks, and the blood"
28975,Which in round drops upon their whiteness stood.
28976,"She bows her head, the new-sprung flower to smell,"
28977,Comparing it to her Adonis’ breath;
28978,"And says within her bosom it shall dwell,"
28979,Since he himself is reft from her by death;
28980,"She drops the stalk, and in the breach appears"
28981,"Green-dropping sap, which she compares to tears."
28982,"“Poor flower,” quoth she, “this was thy father’s guise,"
28983,"Sweet issue of a more sweet-smelling sire,"
28984,"For every little grief to wet his eyes,"
28985,"To grow unto himself was his desire,"
28986,"And so ’tis thine; but know, it is as good"
28987,To wither in my breast as in his blood.
28988,"“Here was thy father’s bed, here in my breast;"
28989,"Thou art the next of blood, and ’tis thy right:"
28990,"Lo in this hollow cradle take thy rest,"
28991,My throbbing heart shall rock thee day and night:
28992,There shall not be one minute in an hour
28993,Wherein I will not kiss my sweet love’s flower.”
28994,"Thus weary of the world, away she hies,"
28995,And yokes her silver doves; by whose swift aid
28996,"Their mistress mounted through the empty skies,"
28997,In her light chariot quickly is convey’d;
28998,"Holding their course to Paphos, where their queen"
28999,Means to immure herself and not be seen.
